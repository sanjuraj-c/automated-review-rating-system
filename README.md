This project aims to automatically predicts the numerical ratings of the reviews given by the user.It uses Natural Language Processing(NLP), & Machine learning techniques for it.

# Project overview and objective
This project aims to build an automated review rating system that analyzes customer reviews and predicts the rating associated with each review. In many real-world scenarios, users provide detailed textual feedback, but numeric ratings may be missing, inconsistent, or biased. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can understand the sentiment and content of a review and accurately classify it into one of the standard rating categories (e.g., 1 to 5 stars).

By processing and analyzing review text using natural language processing techniques, this system helps businesses quickly identify the sentiment of customer feedback, monitor product performance, and make data-driven decisions without manual intervention.
