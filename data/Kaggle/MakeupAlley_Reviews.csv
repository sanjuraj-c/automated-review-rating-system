2021-07,1.0,I normally only need to wash my hair every 3-4 days but with this shampoo my hair was greasy after 1 day. After about a week of use it caused me to break out in these sore bumps on my scalp. I stopped using it and they've since gone away. The consistency is also like jelly and not easy to use. Worst shampoo I've used. ,Orchid Oil Shampoo
2020-08,2.0,"My hair is long, thick, and dries mostly straight with some wave. I do balayage which means a little dryness and damage but overall my hair is pretty healthy. This shampoo definitely overstripped my hair which is pretty surprising for something sulfate-free. Goes to show that sulfates aren't the only ingredients that matter in a shampoo formula. The smell is ok, not my favorite, it does linger which is great if you like it. Left my hair feeling really tangled, dry, and stiff even after using the matching conditioner (which wasn't much better).

Pros:
-affordable
-lathers well

Cons:
-too drying
-doesn't smell that great
-weird jelly-like texture that is hard to squeeze out of the bottle.

Definitely would not use again.",Orchid Oil Shampoo

2018-08,5.0,"I rarely have good results with using drug store shampoos and conditioners on my fine, highlighted, humidity-sensitive hair. A friend raved about this, and I saw it at the drugstore, buy one, 2nd one 50percent off, so both shampoo and conditioner together were $12. Worth taking a risk!  It left my hair smooth, soft and shiny, plus smelling fabulous! I will probably alternate with another product, but for now, it will be a staple in my shower!",Orchid Oil Shampoo

2021-06,4.0,"If I were to rate this on being a hairspray used to keep my hair in place, it would be a 1/5 stars... but I'm rating this as a HAIR TEXTURIZER, and giving it 4/5 stars! Used this on vacation in Puerto Rico, and initially wasn't sure if it's the mix of beach water and this spray, but I had AMAZING hair texture that have my normally flat, sleek hair body and a bit of wave. I still use it, and can confirm that this still provides grippy texture which the &quot;anti-humidity&quot; formula helps with. Doesn't make your hair crunchy or immovable, still keeps things soft and flexible even when doused generously over the hair (but don't go too crazy). ",Smoothing + Shea Sleek Humidity-Blocking Hairspray
2021-05,3.0,"I tried this in conjunction with the matching Charcoal shampoo. They both smell nice which is great for in the shower. After using the shampoo, I definitely felt that I needed deep moisture (as all shampoos do). This seems to have a rich texture, but after I rinsed and towel dried my hair, my hair felt really stripped. I think it's too much for my hair, which is very thick and wavy/curly. I'm using up my bottles by sharing with my roommate, and occasionally I may use these products if I feel like I need a deep cleanse.",Charcoal Detox Conditioner
2019-08,4.0,"I loved the Charcoal detox shampoo and used alone initially to see how well it worked. I then added in the conditioner to my routine. I really like them both! The conditioner has that same 'men's body wash' fragrance which might be a deal-breaker for some, personally I didn't mind as the product itself delivers and I can always use a fragranced hair mist to disguise my masculine-smelling hair. This conditioner seems to work better when I don't use a generous amount, I find a smaller amount of product seems to work better for my hair and leave it less oilier. I apply this to the lengths and ends, and let it sit for around 5 minutes whilst I get on with my shower. Results: lovely soft hair which although not in the 'silicone' way of feeling soft, is more of a natural softness that just feels healthy. I wasn't sure if the charcoal in here would interfere with my hair color, luckily it doesn't strip or fade the dye. If you're oily or looking for a conditioner with decent slip that rinses out easily, this is well worth a try.

2021-04,4.0,"I'm surprised at all the low reviews for this shampoo -- I really like it!  I have very boring hair though so I'm not looking for any specific results from my shampoo, I just need something that cleans well (and smells nice), and this fits the bill perfectly.  It foams up nicely, rinses clean, and I have no issues with it.  The bottle also lasts a good long while, especially if you have short hair like me.  It's a really basic shampoo, but that's what I like about it -- no frills.  The packaging is on the bulky side, but eh, I can live with that.  I think OGX as a brand is a little pricey for the drugstore, but I would purchase this product again, and I'd like to explore some more shampoos from OGX too.",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2021-02,1.0,Picked this up at the supermarket and my mother told me to put it back as it gave her horrible greasy hair when she used this shampoo back in the day! I wanted to try the product myself so I purchased. The product made my hair feel so thick and greasy and not exactly the effect you'd expect from a Moroccan Argan oil shampoo! My roots especially felt very greasy- and this happened every single time I used the shampoo. Never purchasing again and not bothered to try any more OGX products ,Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2019-08,4.0,"I enjoy using this shampoo for many reasons. It doesn’t dry out my hair. I have the option to wear my hair wavy without frizz or straight without frizz . My ends feel nice Not super soft but definitely not dry. It’s not that expensive &amp; it’s almost always on sale ! The bigger bottle comes with a pump which is very helpful ! My scalp is usually very oily . Most shampoos just make the oil problem worse this does not. It’s also sold at almost every major store . You can even find it at your local Grocery store which is also helpful if you run out. It doesn’t cause me any back acne . The scent doesn’t bother my allergies where most shampoos do . So it’s great for those many reasons . Overall I would rate this shampoo a 4/5 ! I wouldn’t recommend this for someone with Dry hair because overtime your hair will dry out even more . But, normal to oily hair this a great affordable option ! ",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo

2018-08,5.0,"I only tried this range of hair products for the first time this year and have to say it agrees with my hair. My hair is quite dry and many shampoos and leave it feeling even more dry.   

This shampoo smells quite nice, I was initially disappointed to find that the lather texture wasn't that great - I felt as though I was washing my hair with a conditioner.  However, despite this, whenever I use it I find my hair, after washing, feels lovely and always has a good healthy sheen. I have not used another shampoo since. ",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2018-08,2.0,"This shampoo smells great and left my hair silky and shiny, but also caused a terrible allergic reaction. I have sensitive skin and immediately felt a burning sensation when I used this shampoo and conditioner. I washed them off quickly, but still my lips and face swelled up and I had chapped lips and angry red eczema on my neck, hands, scalp and face for days. I would advise that you stay away from this range if you have sensitive skin. ",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2018-08,5.0,"My shampoo bottle busted in my suitcase on the road. I bought a 3 ounce travel size for $2.50 at Walgreens. If you buy the full size at $7 for almost 20 ounces, that's not a bad price. 

My hair is recovering from some abuse and gets frizzy and dry. It has also thinned out recently and has lost a lot of it's luster. I need a good moisturizing shampoo that doesn't weigh my hair down, or strip it and can remove build up. It also needs to smell clean and elegant, not like a clown threw up vanilla ice cream on my head.  

This did the job. I got many unusual complements on how shiny and soft my hair was.  The smell is a tad bit sweet, but has a musk to it that makes it nice. The fragrance didn't last past the next morning. It wasn't as moisturizing as my current shampoo, but it gave enough. I had a little bit of trouble getting a lather,  but that could of been the water in the area. The cap kept leaking after it was closed. Travelers hate leaking caps. Or it's just my curse of leaking shampoo.   

Overall,  I've had the same result with other drugstore shampoos, and I don't regret it. I might buy a full size if I want to switch up one day. ",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo

2018-08,4.0,"Hi, this is my first review, anyways, I just washed my hair with the shampoo &amp; conditioner and i’ve got some results...

My hair is very very thin, and gets usually damaged pretty fast. Anyways, I rinsed my hair with water and then I started to use the shampoo. I leaved the shampoo in the hair for 2-3 minutes and I rinsed it out with warm water, and did the same thing again. After the secound wash, I actually realized that my hair got sooo soft! I rinsed the shampoo out of my hair and started with the conditioner. I leaved the conditioner in my hair for 5 minutes and rinsed it also out. My hair got softer and also shinier than usually. 
After, when my got a little bit more dry, I brushed it and I saw wow, my hair is super shiny and so soft!

The smell of the two products are very nice. My skin did react to it good, like it didn’t hurt or something. 
So, I recommend this product! ",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2017-08,4.0,"This brand used to be my go-to for sulfate free shampoos and conditioners in the drugstore.

2016-08,5.0,"I bough this shampoo along with the matching conditioner when it was on offer at Superdrug. I wanted to get something similar to my Moroccanoil Repair and I heard good things about this range so I gave it a try. it is a ver dense shampoo to the point that it is tricky to squeeze it out and it has a sort of floral smell, so at the start, I found i a bit weird. You don't need a lot but to spread it all over my scalp I tend to diluite it or it is too buttery. I have been very impressed with the results. My hair is super shiny which I didn't expect, it doesn't  weigh it down at all and feels quite hydrated ( mainly thanks to  the conditioner). Overall, very please with the range.

When I use that cleansing shampoo, my hair feels sooooo good; when I use this shampoo, my hair is left feeling lifeless with a ton of greasy buildup. At first I thought it was because I was washing with warm water that my scalp was producing more oil, but seeing the reviews on here I'm guessing it's just this product that's causing it.",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo

I tried this as it was half price at Superdrug but it leaves my hair in such a bad state - not only would my hair get greasy faster than normal, but it created extra tangles and static to boot.

My hair was soft, shiny, and stayed clean for a few days.  I know someone with great hair and the shampoo used to get that gorgeous head of hair that way was Organix Tea Tree Mint.  I will try that one too!",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2016-08,5.0,"Background: My hair is medium, Asian straight, non-virgin, prone to breakage and tangles and has scratchy split-ends. I've always wanted to try Organix shampoos (especially the Tsubaki one!) and got my hands on a double-sized bottle for $5.

The shampoo is very thick and rich - it's almost like putting a hair masque on but it's shampoo! The smell is very sophisticated too. The first time I rinsed it from my hair, I could noticeably FEEL the tangles being washed out with the product. Lathering up normally puts my hair in knots, but not after using this. It was instantly soft and smooth in the shower. I was hooked from that moment on.

My hair does require conditioner, so I've been pairing this shampoo with my all time holy grail It's A 10 Miracle Leave-In Conditioner and combing out my hair while wet. During the daytime my hair is so friggin' soft, I can't help but twirl it in my fingers all day. It's like touching real silk.

Price-wise, I got it at a good deal. I try not to go overboard with spending serious coin on makeup AND bath goods. This product lives up to its promises though, so I don't mind.

2016-08,1.0,"Very 'meh' product, dried out my hair a little. I have oily roots and dry ends; my hair is by default decent though, it's shiny and I don't get any frizz or split ends and even then I don't really like this, it doesn't make my hair soft at all. It definitely costs too much for its quality, there are shampoos that cost way less and do the same or even better. I was looking for a substitute for my eruca shampoo which ran out and I haven't been able to find locally after I moved overseas, unfortunately this isn't it. 

I tried the conditioner too and it didn't condition my hair much, the ends were still dry. The treatment doesn't work that well either. I mean, I have the kind of hair that's okay without conditioner or treatments and even I feel like it's way inadequate.

It's much thicker and more gelatinous than any shampoo that I've ever used before; maybe this consistency is why it doesn't lather nearly as much as other shampoos.

2014-08,2.0,"UPDATE: WTH? Why would they re-formulate with non-natural ingredients inc. dimethicone?  Cost, perhaps?

I loved using this shampoo in my rotation but my love affair only lasted one bottle.  Oh well.  I'm returning it to Boots as their website shows the old ingredients list and I obv. won't re-purchase unless I can find some 'old' bottles on Ebay.  NOW I understand some of the negative reviews. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Considering Argan oil is fairly high up on the ingredients list (as well as other natural oils) this is a reasonably-priced shampoo.  I'm stunned at the negative reviews on this shampoo as I've had such a  positive experience with it SO FAR(!) but I wonder if they're mostly from people whose hair is very dry already as more natural shampoos won't usually do your hair any favours when it comes to moisture.  Even though this one is supposed to give you moisture it probably wouldn't give enough for those hair types.  Anyhow, despite being a regular 'oiler' (mostly for hair growth) recently I've been finding I need a slightly more moisturising shampoo than I'm used to in order to avoid tangles as I grow my hair longer.  Nothing too conditioning, just a natural-ish shampoo that won't leave my hair squeaky clean, just clean.  I have coloured, fine, bra strap length hair with a slight wave and I normally do well with mild, natural shampoos.  I don't want SLS or anything else colour-stripping, or dimethicone (it contains dimethicone copolyol, a water-soluble silicone-derivative) and I don't mind a slight lack of lather which you expect when you leave out SLS.  It's early days but this seems to fit the bill.  I don't use the matching conditioner as I'm happy with my current ones.  I'm not sure I'd want to use this one every time I wash as I think I would soon get buildup at my oily roots, but as it doesn't make my fine hair a stringy mess or overload it, I'm pleased. BTW the texture really reminds me of Faith in Nature Jojoba shampoo (for dry hair).  I gave up on that really quickly about a year ago as I don't think I understood you have to emulsify it with water in your hand to get a lather before working it into your hair.  I might give it another try if I can't find the old formula for this shampoo.",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2014-08,5.0,"Ive been using this for 2 years since garnier fructis changed their triple nutrition line changed and i LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. The conditioner is amazing, however the shampoo can be a bit stripping but i find that the conditioner fixes the problem. I use the conditioner to co wash in the winter and i love it. I wear weaves and braids and it works amazing with them as well. I do want to try a new shampoo because its expensive but i always seem to go back to them. I thought i had 4c hair because in the beginning of my transition, my hair was unmanageable but after i started using silicon mix and castor oil my hair is more of a 4a/4b. I bleached my hair and this condition seems to be the only thing that works to keep it healthy.

I LOVEEEE ITTTT. i have to say i have noticed a slight change from when i started using it to now but i still love it. Ive tried other organix (coconut, regular argon oil, shea butter) and my hair felt like straw afterwards so idk what it is about this one but i love it",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2014-08,3.0,"Personally, I would only use this product again if I had ran out of a better shampoo. It does a good job of cleaning my hair and lathers well but doesn't make my hair feel soft at all. In fact, I can feel my hair drying out as my hair gets cleaner. The texture of the shampoo is very silky and thick, which feels lovely as I put it on my hair. It has a nice smell but doesn't last long after it has been rinsed out. I have 4c coarse hair. Tbh the conditioner is a bit better than the shampoo. For the price, I think Organix could have done a lot better. ",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo

2014-08,1.0,"This is probably the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.

I have really long (Hip length) hair that tends to be naturally wavy or slightly curly, so of course I need as much hydration as possible to maintain it.  And up until using this shampoo and conditioner I have done really well.  My hair is always shiny and soft and if I have curls they are bouncy and soft.   

However, I bought Organix Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco and after using it once, I thought it would be a good buy.  At first use it makes the hair feel very thick and it lathers up into a dream.  The conditioner was thick and also made my hair feel really moisturized and thick. ....in the shower.   But as soon as I rinsed I noticed a big change in my hair.  It felt rough and brittle.  I got out of the shower and let it dry and immediately noticed it was frizzy with almost no shine and it was a big tangled mess. 

The next day I did the exact same thing except I blow dried.  It was a little more manageable but still frizzy and dry and brittle with almost no shine.  I bought the larger bottle of the conditioner and shampoo and I will not be finishing using either of them because even though this shampoo and conditioner was a little more pricey than what I normally buy, it is not worth ruining my hair. I have since purchased my usual, Tresemme, and noticed after only ONE use that my hair was feeling better than after a whole week of using the Moroccan Oil shampoo from Organix..  

Don't let the whole &quot;Moroccan Oil&quot; and &quot;Organic&quot; thing fool you.  This product is a big waste of money and will torture your hair. ",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo

It doesn't lather that well either so I'm surprised it would be so stripping. It does have a nice scent and left my hair shiny, but that is pretty much it. I am very disappointed as I have had luck with other Organix shampoos in the past. My favorite is the Macadamia one in the brown bottle. I will probable reserve the remaining bottles for when I need to clarify or pass them on to family members. Back to the drawing board.",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo
2014-08,4.0,"A little info about my hair before I review this product: it's long (reaches about mid-lower back), fine, straight, un-dyed, and normal (with a slight lean towards oily during the warmer months and around my period)

My usual hair care routine: Shampoo &amp; condition (focusing mostly on the lower 1/3 of my hair, especially the tips) every 2-3 days with a bit of Argan oil run through after (again, focusing mostly on the ends) with my hands and fingers. Almost always towel/air dried.

I bought this product because I was desperate. This past winter was, for my area, incredibly cold and cry. My normal hair care routine just wasn't cutting it. My hair was so dry.. it was brittle and straw-like! Not something I ever really encounter since I don't straighten or blow dry my hair often.

I'd bought travel sizes of a different shampoo + conditioner with argan oil the previous year so I wouldn't have to pack a full sized bottle of oil and remembered liking it... Couldn't find that brand and saw this at CVS and thought &quot;what the hell, why not&quot;

It worked like a miracle. After a few uses my hair was back to it's usual silky soft self. I feel like this product gently cleans my hair well without stripping it (duh?) which I really, really like. 

This shampoo and the matching conditioner became the only stuff I used during the winter and will definitely use again if the next cold season is the same.

That said.. I probably would NOT use this during the summer. Or if I had oily hair. And would not recommend unless your hair is incredibly dry/damaged or you live in a very cold, arid climate.

Some other info:

The packaging is unique, imo, and stands out in both color and shape amongst the rest of the crap in my shower... However, it can be difficult to squeeze the product out once you nearing the bottom of the bottle.

I enjoy the smell of this shampoo- it's kind of a light musky floral-y scent. The texture/consistency of both the shampoo and conditioner took some getting used to... very viscous and almost gel-like. It also takes quite a bit of work to get a nice lather going (which doesn't bother me in the slightest, but may bother others).

I believe the conditioner says to let it sit on your hair for a few minutes? I forget how long exactly but I just leave it for however long it takes to wash/exfoliate my face (not more than a minute or two).

I've noticed while my hair is wet after using this product it's a bit difficult to brush/comb through; I usually end up letting it air dry most of the way before brushing it. Once my hair is dry it's so unbelievably soft. And it doesn't look too flat either which is a bonus.",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Shampoo

2018-08,4.0,"After a few weeks with this, my hair feels amazing.  I don't use it every day, but a few times a week.  My crispy ends feel great and look good too. It's been rather humid here and my hair isn't frizzing, even if I skip the flat iron. I'll never be without this. 
----------

I've been coloring my hair since I was 13 and found Sun In.  I'm now 50, dropped out of beauty school along the way, but won't let anyone do my color. I've had stubborn grays since my 20s and now have some serious dalt and pepper hair. I've been every color from blonde to black, and have out my natural medium-dark hair through the wringer more than once. Currently it's mid back length and jet black, some waves and curls, long layers.  I love it.  I use a hair dryer and flat iron most days, and wash almost daily because if I don't my scalp breaks out. Whew. Now that we've met, let me tell you why I picked this up on a BOGO50 at Walgreens...

I research what goes into my hair. I'm also on a budget. And I hate shopping. So I'd rather just the drug store or Target than Ulta for my beauty needs. I use very few high end products because they're out of my pay grade. The challenges with black hair is that it hates the sun, which is a problem because I don't, especially in the summer. I use a hair dryer almost daily, and a few swipes of a flat iron not for stick straight hair, but to calm waves and frizz.  I don't pass over a section more than twice. I use leave in conditioners and serums, and I also use a clarify shampoo a few times a month to allow my products to work better. Having said that, I know that keratin can be detrimental sometimes, and really avoid using any at all costs, minimal at best. Too much and your hair breaks and becomes dry and brittle. But I recently noticed my ends being very dry and crispy. I upped my cowashing, wore my hair up more and shampooed less.  It didn't help. I knew it was time for serious help. 

I figured I had nothing to lose with a keratin treatment at this point. I picked up a packet of some other product at Walmart for $1.50, and really liked the results. I got this set the next day at Walgreens and gave used it twice now. Again, I'm not looking for pin straight, just healtheir ends and calming frizz and flyaways. The scent is nice and beachy. The conditoner is a nice thick formula and a little goes a long way. Same with the shampoo. After two uses, adding a few spritzes of a leave in and the Organix Coconut milk serum at my ends (I already that this one), I dried on warm heat without a nozzle till about 90%, then on hot with the attachment and a brush. Again, wasn't looking for miracle results, but was pleasantly surprised that my crunchy ends feel better. I still have a lot of body and volume and still need the flat iron, but my hair looks and feels shiny. No tangle issues here.

Definitely would buy again.

2018-08,3.0,"I have very dry hair, and this combo works great for me, even though it is supposed to be a straightening agent (of some sort)?  The shampoo is luxurious and does not strip my hair.  The conditioner is thick and condensed.  I have naturally beachy waves, and this combo does not suppress or remove the waves or body.  I have less frizz on the days I use this combo.  I love the nutty chocolately smell.  Above all, neither product dries out my hair.   

I co-wash every other day with GVP's conditioning balm and the 10 minute miracle hair mask (from Sally's Beauty Supply).  The days I want shampoo I use this Organix combo.

2017-08,4.0,"I really like the scent of this shampoo and conditioner. 
It smells like cocoa butter. 
This shampoo cleanses well and does help a with my frizzy hair. 
It does not strip my hair and does not irritate my scalp. 
What I love most, other than the scent, is that my hair did seem to look healthier with continued use and I noticed a lot less fall out in the shower as well as my dry, itchy scalp was not as angry.  
Both the shampoo and conditioner together left my hair clean and soft. 
Will I purchase again?
I am not too sure, if I do it will only be the large bottles and only if I can find them on sale. 
It did help with the frizz more so than other smoothing shampoos and conditioners have but it was not so significant to win me over completely. I wish I would have been able to find their matching flat iron spray to use along with them to see if that helped more but I could not find it.
I am also not the biggest fan of the bottles, I do like the cute shape to look at but I find them hair to squeeze out the thick formula.

2017-08,4.0,"One of the only shampoos that works for my hair. Makes my hair softer and shinier for 2-3 days until I wash it again. I took this on holiday with me and my friend borrowed it, she loved it too. Other shampoos from supermarket make my hair feel stripped of moisture and straw-like. A hairdresser told me to avoid shampoo with sodium laureth sulfate, as it strips your hair of moisture, so possibly this Organix shampoo doesn't contain that, although I'm not sure.

It is quite expensive though compared to other supermarket shampoos, especially if you're buying the shampoo and conditioner together. ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy

I have very dry thin and brittle hair so I was looking for a sulfate-free product that would help tame my hair. Sulfate-free, yes. Taming, not so much.

My scalp is oily and prone to itchy, painful bumps which have totally gone since I have been using this shampoo and conditioner (alternating with the Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil products from OGX as well).  My hair is damaged, baby fine and very porous.  Normally I need at least twice as much conditioner as I do shampoo.  Not the case with this stuff.  If you can imagine it's more like a body butter than a body lotion, you're getting the idea of how thick and creamy it is.  I really didn't think this was going to be great with my hair.  Meanwhile, I use about half a teaspoon of the conditioner and it is more than enough to massage through from my ears down to the tips.  (I never do my roots)  Because it's so thick, it stays on your hands, which gives more control of application.  I'm not crazy about the smell - it's sweet and nutty - almost chocolatey.

2013-08,4.0,"I definitely found that this shampoo helped make my hair straighter and there were no frizzies!!  I have naturally straight hair on the finer side which will dry to a slight wave if I let it air dry.  I also get insane frizzies with flyaways and find that many shampoos which claim to be smoothing and anti frizz actually make my frizziness worse.  This one however works wonders! 

My hair was super smooth, super soft and super straight.  I usually have to blow dry and flat iron to get the straight look that I'm after yet after using this shampoo my hair only needed the blow dry to be straight.  It was also so easy to comb through my hair when it was wet and the blow dry was so quick, my hair just seemed to naturally fall into perfect place.  

The scent is also really amazing, kind of like a chocolate caramel nutty concoction. 

I find that using this shampoo with the Organix coconut milk conditioner worked the best for my hair, the Keratin conditioner was a bit too lightweight for me.  

If you've got naturally straight hair which you want to give a little more oomph to give this shampoo a try!

UPDATE: For unknown reasons this shampoo stopped working for me. After using it for about 2 weeks it just started making my hair limp and unmanageable.  I had a similar experience with the Organix Coconut Milk shampoo.  I'm not sure what it is about Organix products but they just don't seem to stand up to the test of time.  I'm done with the brand and would recommend to anyone who is interested in it to look elsewhere for an organic hair care line. ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy

The problem is that the product also claims to help straighten hair, and I did not experience this effect to even the slightest degree.

2013-08,3.0,"I'm not usually a comment person, but I read some of the reviews after trying this product.  This is a KERATIN therapy shampoo.  A key tell tale sign that your hair needs keratin is if it feel slimy in the shower.  It means your hair has too much moisture and needs the keratin to balance it out.  This explains the dryness that some of you experienced.  Being that it was too much for some of you, your hair didnt need it.  I am a cosmetologist and really emphasize to my clients that they need to pay attention to the &quot;feels&quot; of their hair to figure out what it really needs.  Not what you want.

It works wonders on my hair and yes, it does actually straighten my mermaid-y wavy hair and does reduce almost all of the frizz (trust me there's a sizable amount).  This being said i have a theory as to why so many reviews have trouble.  I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, i think using this shampoo (and conditioner) any more than that would be too harsh on your hair and cause many of the problems other reviews are having.  On top of this, I also try to wash my hair in luke warm water - another preventative measure to reduce drying.  My suggestion would be to try out one or both of these options when using this shampoo (and conditioner) as i have had nothing but success from both products.

The first time I used it, it was wonderful. My hair was very soft, shiny and dandruff free. The next time I used the product, it was a little different. My hair became was filled with tangles and very hard to manage. I thought it was because I didn't use enough conditioner because my hair was also very very dry. 
The last time I used it a couple days ago, it became it's worst ever. I could hardly brush my hair without using detangler. I couldn't even put it in a pony tail without losing tons of hair from trying to brush it. Though it made my hair shiny and a bit soft, it has to be the worst shampoo/conditioner I've ever brought.

*******************************************************************************
 
During her few minutes away, she looked up the product online to check the ingredients because she was astounded that a shampoo could do that much damage.  The lady in the shampoo bowl right next to me witnessed everything happening to me and said, &quot;What is that product?  Tell me so I can avoid it!&quot;
When she came back, she told me that in her professional opinion, sometimes keratin can be too drying.  Even though on your shampoo bottle it only says &quot;This rich formual of Brazilian Coconut Oil and Keratin Proteins to smooth and strengthen your curly or wavy tresses.&quot;  The stylist felt that my hair had an extreme reaction to this dryness and that is why I got massive clumps of impenetrable tangles.
At that point, that was little comfort.  Somewhat of an explanation, sure, but little comfort.  At this point, I have been laying back in a shampoo bowl with two stylists working with litte success on getting these out - and &quot;these&quot; are ALL over the back of my head.
 
 
Thinking of what to do next, they put more intense conditioner on my head, put me in a plastic cap and put me under head, hoping that would soften these dreadlock-style clumps.  During that time, they consulted with the lead stylist as to what to do next.
 
 
After awhile, the lead stylist knelt down beside my dryer and the concerned look on her face made me start to cry immediately.  I told her, &quot;Don't tell me.  You can't do anything but cut them out, right?  I knew it!&quot;  She assured me not to worry, that she would do all she could to help me so she wouldn't have to cut them out, that she has experience working with some clients with dreadlocks and has experience with difficult processes like this.
 
 
I felt better, somewhat, for the time being.  The lead stylist, Allison, took me back to her station and, with the assistance of the two other stylists, they began again the tedious and painstaking tast of trying to undo these wickedly tight clumps of hair.  
 
 
After another 2 hours of this I hesitatingly asked, &quot;So, you still think you don't have to cut it out?  If you did, how much would you have to take off?&quot;  Allison paused and put her hand where the clump ended and said, &quot;Eight inches, but I don't want to have to do that.  Let's keep trying.&quot;  
All I heard was 8 inches!  I sat there, praying for God to give her and the other 2 stylists the continued patience and skill to work through my hair so it wouldn't have to be cut.
 
 
I came into this salon at 2:15 pm.  I left a little after 6:00 pm.  This is how long it took 3 stylists to get through this hairmagedden and I don't say that to be funny - I mean it.  And the physical pain of them trying to get through was excruciating, despite their best efforts to minimize my discomfort.  I said I will go through anything just as long as they can try and save my long hair.
 
 
When all 3 stylists got through, I was back by the shampoo bowl getting a light shampoo and another deep condition.  After that, they didn't want to dry or style my hair because of all that me and my hair went through in those 4 hours.  they left it damp and gently braided it and told me to let it dry that way and let my hair and scalp rest.  They also suggested that I take some ibuprofen when I get home to help me with all the pain I went through.
 
 
Today is the 30th, the day after.  My hair is still in the braid and I'm afraid to take it out because I expect to see considerable damage from all the picking they did with those rat tail combs.  
 
 
Mind you, I am FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK AND PATIENCE.  They saved my long hair!  I can't say enough about these women and the wonderful job they did and also their compassion.  Despite how my long hair looks now and the damage done, I still have it.  They could have taken the lazy way out and advised that I cut it, but they didn't.  They saw my tears and panic and went to work to try and save my hair.
 
 
Like those stylists, it's astounding to me that your shampoo could do so much damage.  A SHAMPOO!  What on earth!  Why?!  If I was prone to fooling around with chemicals and colors at home, well then I guess I deserve to have my hair wrecked and shouldn't cry about it.  BUT I DON'T!  I simply washed my hair!  
This appointment yesterday cost me $70.00.  This is the most &quot;expensive shampoo&quot; I've ever had!  
 
 
I don't know what you can do as a company to warn people on your bottles, but you need to do something.  This has been the most harrowing experience I have ever had!!  Costly in physical pain and money not too mention the fear I had the whole time.
 
 
It's simply wrong that a product could do that!  These stylists talked to me about Keratin and the new fad about Brazilian treatments.  It works for some, but it can be very drying.  Grant you, I did not use a chemical  at home, but only a shampoo but the shampoo touts &quot;Brazilian Therapy with Keratin&quot;.  If there are risks with keratin, it should say so on your bottle!
 
 
I told they stylists that I thought keratin was a good thing, that it is a protein and a building block for hair.  They said yes, that's true, but keratin can be very drying on some people and in my case it was so drying it made my hair form very bad clumps.
 
 
To say that I'm disappointed is an understatement.  I don't even want to look at my hair at this point.  I can also assure you that I saw loads and loads of hair fall to the floor as they were attempting to undo these massive clumps but not because of them being careless.  They were not, but trying to be gentle as possible.  Really, what 3 stylists do you know that wants to stand for 4 hours trying to undo a mess like that?  Not many, but they did. 
 
 
I told them that I would let your company know what happened.  If you have any questions or doubts, I'm sure you can talk to the lead stylist Allison.  The ha",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy

I was also surprised by how moisturizing it is.  I usually wash my hair at night and then sleep on it braided. I have not had a bad hair day since using this product and I've gotten so many compliments. When I bought the shampoo I didn't realize it was meant to help straighten hair. Mine is naturally wavy, and it's still just as wavy while using this. That's fine by me, but someone who us looking for a straightening  shampoo would be disappointed.

2012-08,1.0,"If I could give this no stars, I absolutely would. Not only because the treatment did not work, but because customer service at Organix was honestly the worst I have ever experienced (and that is truly saying something). 

I followed the directions word for word, carefully, and using the products they ask to use (a hot straightening iron). After having to spend close to 3 hours on my hair, followed by an awful 48 hours of greasy, smelly hair, I honestly saw NO RESULTS. I was hoping for anything - anything for me to feel like paying $15 was worth it, but honestly I should have just thrown my money in the trash can. 

I then followed up with an email to Organix to see what they could offer - advice, insight, or a refund, but was offered instead - the worst customer service ever... After sending an initial inquiry email it took two weeks for any response in which they scolded me for not following directions. Seriously - if I didn't follow directions - why would I be complaining about an ineffective product? When I responded to that email, it then took 3 weeks for another response with this:

&quot;I apologize but we do not offer a money back guarantee.&quot;

No greeting, no name, no nothing. I am hoping to be in touch with a supervisor or manager but after the service I have seen, I'm not expecting it. If I could report this company to somewhere I absolutely would. Any ideas?

So I guess the bottom line is, If you are prepared to waste $15, sore arms, and loads of time on this terrible product, then be my guest - go for it. For all those who are still thinking about it - I just suggest waiting for an online deal where you can go to a professional hair stylist (I just found a deal for $79) and actually see results.

It smellt too much like a sweet cigar or tobacco, which I didn't like but YMMV. I have benefited greatly from biotin but only when I took it orally.    ",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo
2018-08,3.0,"This was AMAZING when my hair was healthy and dyed dark brown, it gave my hair lovely volume and kept it soft. Then... when I went blonde, through about 5 heavy highlighting sessions, I repurchased it thinking it would help my dried out bleached hair, nope it just made it super tangled. So now my hair needs something more repairing and I won’t be repurchasing this. But if you have non - damaged hair that needs a bit of volume this is probably for you ",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo
2018-08,2.0,"Aside from how overly perfumed this shampoo was and therefore my hair, I didn't notice anything else with this, nor any difference in my hair quality by switching to this. It lathers nicely and feels like a more higher end formula, but it leaves my hair completely flat for some reason and weighed down. I also notice my hair gets oily a lot quicker than usual when using this which didn't happen before. It's a shame as was interested to see how Biotin and Collagen would work for my hair as both ingredients are something I take as an oral supplement but not applied to hair before. Not something that I would go out and re-purchase in a hurry.

2018-08,5.0,"I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner (19.5 ounces in each bottle) for about $9 a piece at the drugstore.  I've been using them for about a month.  

My fine, shiny, color treated hair needs volume but moisturizing properties too. Most products containing protein, take care of the thin and breakage, but dry out my ends. Most moisturizing products weigh my hair down. This contains protein but moisturizer too. This gave me what I needed wonderfully! 

My hair looks thick, shiny and full, with a spicy and sweet fragrance, but it still smells clean.  I have noticed that even though it states on the bottle that the effects of the products are temporary, I have noticed the volume lasts, less breakage to my ends and less hair fall since using it. It hasn't turned my blonde ends brassy or stripped the color elsewhere. I've used it in multiple water hardness  while traveling and I get good results.  I have not noticed any building up of residue.  

I've travelled with the full size bottles (something I don't normally do) and haven't experienced any leaks or loose caps. I've dropped them in the shower a few times.  The bottle is very sturdy. 

I'm pleasantly surprised. I might stick with this system.   ",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo

Sulfate free has come a long way :) ",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo
2017-08,1.0,"Well, bummer. I was really hoping this shampoo would work for me but, alas, no. I agree with another reviewer that said the only thing it's got going for it is the smell. Washing your hair with it is a very pleasant sensory experience...the formula feels really good on your hair &amp; hands and it has a warm, sugary smell. However, that's where anything positive ends for me. It leaves my hair dry, tangly (even with a deep conditioner), and the ends look stringy/thin. Yuck. In addition, my regular styling products are rendered totally ineffective.I really can't understand how this works for people with the hair type it's intended for (fine &amp; thin). My hair is baby-fine and I don't have a lot of it, so my choice of shampoo matters. This one is a definite dud for me and I won't repurchase.",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo
2017-08,4.0,"I've always liked this brand, but even more so after I cut my hair short. I did that in part because it's been shedding a lot and getting a bit thinner and troublesome, and after the cut this line was worked so well for me. I first got the anti-fallout with the niacin and caffeine, but I like to alternate because my hair seems to get fatigue from using the same products all the time. So I added this to the rotation because of the biotin and all that, and like it a lot.
First off, it does have a really strong fragrance. The shampoo in particular, though the conditioner, while scented, isn't as potent. I struggled to figure out the scent, because it's not something that screams shampoo to me, and it was weirdly familiar. Finally it came to me: It smells a lot -- though I don't think it's a duplicate -- of TokyoMilk's Honey and the Moon. That one is described as smelling of honey, sugared violet, jasmine and sandalwood. This one is very close to that. It's a bit sweet, a bit flowery, and a bit something else. Fortunately I like the TokyoMilk so this was a happy find, even though I generally hate overly fragranced product. 
The shampoo lathers well and leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped. The conditioner isn't heavy in that it doesn't leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy. I think I get a bit of volume from this duo, too. Nothing major, but I'm happier with it than I was with other products by other brands that left my hair looking limp and lifeless. I also notice less shedding with this line and the niacin-caffeine line, so I'm happy with that, too.
It's too soon to tell if the biotin (how much of that is actually in these, I can't say) will make a difference, but as a day-to-day shampoo and conditioner, I'm happy with how it cleans, adds a bit of body, and makes my hair fluff up a bit.",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo

Even after the first wash I can already feel and see the claims of this brand. My hair feels lighter but with volume. The hair-fall even minimized. I was very happy because I thought I already found a holy grail for my hair problems. 

However, after maybe three weeks of washing, my hair fall fall problem is back and I am also starting to have dandruff. The same thing happened to my husband who is also using both, shampoo and conditioner.

2016-08,5.0,"I'm obsessed with how this shampoo makes my hair look! There is a very noticeable difference in my hair thickness/volume when I use this vs other shampoos. This gives a lift and noticeable bounce to my hair (which is long and stick straight). It seriously makes it look like I got an expensive blowout every time I use it. I never use the conditioner though, just shampoo, rinse and done. All other volumizing shampoos make my hair feel greasy, heavy and gross like it's coated with something. With this my hair is light, clean, fresh and has noticeable volume. I LOVEEEE this stuff!",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo
2016-08,1.0,"I decided to give this shampoo a second chance after having not used it for a few months, due to it making my hair feel limp and greasy after subsequent use. While unimpressed before, I'm even more unimpressed this time. I used about a quarter-sized glob of shampoo for my shoulder-length hair and it lathered okay. It's only been a few hours since I washed my hair and already my hair feels greasy, heavy and unwashed; as if I didn't even wash it at all. My hair is a bit more on the thick side, so maybe that played a factor in the results I received, but I would not recommend this product. The only positive things I can say about this shampoo is that the scent is pleasant and the packaging is cute. Otherwise, mediocre shampoo, especially for the price.",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo
2016-08,3.0,"By far the least drying thickening product. Lathers well and smells clean, does not turn blonde hair brassy and adds a lot of volume to fine long hair, even air dried. 

If your hair is dry as is, either pair this with a good mask or skip altogether because, like all thickening shampoos, this will also dry your hair out, although it won't be stiff, brittle or waxy, just coarser to touch and less shiny. 

It will be possible to skip an extra day between washes even for very fine hair. 

Those who didn't have any luck ingesting biotin due to acne, may experience a similar side effect with this shampoo. 

Paired with the same conditioner, they make a great volume booster for flat hair but weightless shine serum will be necessary for styling. The set should have a leave-in spray as well, but not a single store carried it for some reason. ",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo

It's like they couldn't decide if they wanted it to smell like cotton candy or cheap perfume, so they threw both in and hoped for the best.

She was surprised that a drug store shampoo had made such a difference! I should not that he rarely touches the matching conditioner.

I, on the other hand, am not as impressed with it, which is why I took off a lippie. My hair is naturally pretty thick so I am not the target audience for this product. For me, this shampoo and conditioner made my hair more susceptible to frizz and made my hair greasier.

I wanted to try a shampoo that wasn't for color treated hair but wanted to stay sulfate free. I found the OGX line and I'd heard good things. I used it for the first time and the scent gave me a headache. I tried it one more time and I decided I would keep using it. I LOVED IT the first few times I used it, however... I'm starting to change my tune. If I use it everyday, I have this weird residue... no matter how much I rinse. I've even gotten back in the shower to rinse it again but saw no change. When it does dry it has little to no volume and it just sits there looking terrible. Now, I know that you only need a tiny bit and the stuff lathers like crazy but for goodness sake I wish it would rinse clean.

I was having issues with my hair falling out and breaking off after becoming obsessed with touching up my hair dye and leaving the dye in my hair longer and more frequent than I should have. Doing that to my hair caused it to break off at the roots. Due to the hair loss, the spikes re growth/baby hairs became more noticable(ew not cute). I watch a few YouTube videos and found this line. I've been using it for 3 months now and can honestly say I see and feel a difference! Even my co workers have mentioned that my hair looks and feels thicker. My hair has grown out so fast from when I had chopped it off last spring. Even the crazy spiky baby hairs have all grown out and now looks more normal around the crown of my head. I'm using the sea weed(kelp?) conditioner from the same brand because the store was OOS on the conditioner version of that shampoo. honestly thought the conditioner itself has made my hair really soft and supple.

What it can do, however is give you the appearance of thicker hair, while you are using it, which is just what this shampoo/conditioner does. That being said, this shampoo &amp; conditioner is preventing me from cutting my hair right now! I have been using it for about a week.

I am approaching 40 and am considering cutting my hair because my ponytail width is definitely not what it used to be!

I was doing research and saw that Biotin is great for hair so I purchased some from Boots in an offer (whoop) and biotin in a tablet form too but only 300ug. 

Used it for a week and my hair felt a lot stronger and more volumised but unfortunately, this made me break out. LOADS!  

I had hairline spots all over my forehead and where I was rinsing out the shampoo, I got little white head pimples on my chest. I've never had acne on my body before so I knew it was the shampoo. I stopped using it immediately. It took months for the pimples to go. I used bio oil to help the healing process to get rid of the scarring it left behind.

Overall it made my hair feel great but the side affects has put me off from purchasing again. I've carried on taking my Biotin tablets and I don't have as many breakouts.

So I've switched to a brand I like much better:  Shea Moisture.  I love the Manuka Honey formula as well as the Tahitian Noni and Raw Shea Butter formulas.  Their masks are also excellent.  I particularly like the Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  It smells really clean and fresh and it removes all the sticky residue from styling products and hairspray.  And SM poos are all sulfate free, paraben and silicone free and , importantly for me, cruelty free.  So what more can you ask for?  SM is a bit more expensive than Organix, but the difference between the two is astounding.  SM leaves my hair soft and silky and really shiny, something the Oragnix shampoos never did.

2016-08,5.0,"I'm so surprised by all of the negative reviews! Perhaps the majority of people reviewing have straight/fine/thin hair? My hair, however, is thick and curly (3A mostly, some 3B for reference) and I wear it straight most of the time. I don't get greasy hair easily.

I randomly picked this up at the drugstore, as I had run out of conditioner and I've had generally good experiences with Organix. I wasn't expecting anything more than a decent conditioner and a nice fragrance. BOY was i surprised as hell!!!

Now, I don't really need more thick and full hair. My hair usually falls a little flat after I straighten it, but NOT after this conditoner. I conditioned with this twice, the first time for about 5 minutes, the second time for maybe two hours...  I then rinsed, let my hair dry in a cotton shirt, then brushed my curls out carefully - my hair was so easy to brush out! My curls weren't frizzy at all, no tangles, and they looked super healthy.

The biggest surprise came while I was blow drying my hair straight with a round brush. AMAZING. I normally don't give a shit when I'm using a blow dryer, but my hair (which normally looked untamed and therefore required a hot iron afterward) looked totally gorgeous and voluminous. I still haven't gone over it with a flat iron.... and I never would skip the smoothing wonders of my iron. Now my hair is soft, smells good, and has a really nice, almost (dare I say it???) salon-like style to it. totally unheard of for me.... give it a try.

2016-08,5.0,I love this conditioner!!!!!! I have pretty straight fine hair that curls a little at the ends and I guess it's a little wavy but it is pretty flat.

It doesn't leave my hair oily at all. ,Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner
2016-08,3.0,"I was given this conditioner by a fellow fine-haired lass for whom it didn't work. She warned me it might weigh my hair down, as it had hers, but I decided to try it anyway. Well, it did weigh my hair down, but I LOVE the scent (it reminds me of Aquolina Pink Sugar, which I wore years ago) and so made it work by using it for reverse-washing (and rotating it with other products). I finished my mostly full bottle.

Organix should either reformulate this to make it work for fine hair or market it for hardier hair types. But definitely keep the delicious scent. Did I mention that it lingers for a couple days? I dig it, but you might not.

2015-08,4.0,"I'm saddened by the bad reviews because I really do love this conditioner. I switched to this set when the Tresemme volume set made my hair fall out and the conditioner left my hair stringy and dry. The organix shampoo fell way short of amazing, the conditioner however is a winner. I have super long, almost waist length hair, that is kinda wavy and that I never brush after showering cause it just looks awkward and frizzy. My ends are dry and prone to breakage and this conditioner is wonderful. I apply it starting at the hair below my ears/around the nape of my neck, and leave it in for 3-5 minutes in the shower. I don't brush and honestly don't really need to cause it's never tangled. My ends look super nourished and every since I stopped using the shampoo of this set my ends don't look over saturated with any ick or anything either. I shower at night and sleep on my hair wet and this conditioner somehow sets my hair into super soft waves and it feels sooooo soft. Despite my praises I can see why this couldn't work with someone who has oily hair, it would definitely leave a coating on the hair shaft. So if you're looking for a conditioner to combat dry/broken ends, I highly recommend this one, not just cause it's great by the 13 oz bottle lasts a lot longer than expected",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner

2014-08,3.0,"I was able to get this in the tall bottle along with the shampoo (also tall bottle) for $10. It seemed like a steal at the time so I caved in. Before this the only Organix products I've bought was the leave in spray.   

I wanted to like this. At first I was amazed with how soft my hair was out of the shower. My boyfriend even liked how my hair smelled. While it is moisturizing for the hair, I feel like it might be a bit much. With other shampoo &amp; conditioners I was able to wait till day 3 for my hair to get super oily. But with this it happens at the end of day one. If I were to try day 2 hair I'd have to use a dry shampoo. I also feel like this weighs down my hair. Which is/isn't nice for me. It's nice because it causes my wavy hair to be straighter but at the same time my roots are also weighed down so my hair doesn't have any volume to it.    

If this wouldn't weigh down my hair so much and I wouldn't get oily so easily, I'd love it.  

2/23/15update: I've figured a way to make this work! I put a bunch of the shampoo in, use the middle of my fingers to massage my scalp, and them rub my ends between my hands (like you would rub your hands together when you're cold). I've stopped heavily scrubbing and now use a large tooth comb too on my wet hair. My hair is silky with this! It's still lacking on 2nd day hair and I want to try some of their other products to see if I can get a bit more volume ",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner
2014-08,2.0,"I think I have to be done with Organix hair products.  I bought this and the matching shampoo and for some reason they make my hair completely flyaway and full of static.  I tried using the shampoo only, with a different conditioner, and had the same problem.  It's only when I stopped using them both that the static went away.  I also don't really like the smell of this product, it's kind of powdery.

I will say that the conditioner detangles pretty well, which is always a problem for me.  But because of the static problem, I'm only using it to coat my ends when I shampoo and then use another conditioner after shampooing (and I am using the corresponding shampoo to wash my delicates in the washing machine).",Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner

2013-08,3.0,I bought this product for my fine hair. I must say for the first couple weeks my hair had lots of volume. The smell of this product is great and I have always loved this company's packaging. After about 3 weeks my hair all of a sudden started becoming greasy and limp. I continued to use it with no improvement. I ended up throwing the remainder away.,Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Conditioner
2013-08,3.0,"**Update**   This formula does build up quite a bit..  After 2 weeks of continuous use my hair was heavy and stringy.  Once a week I use a clarifying shampoo and let my hair rest.   The thickening effect is really great, and I still think it's worth it for occasions.  I just wish it was less heavy on silicones.

Overall, seems like a great thickening conditioner.  The smell is very similar to the Sensual Amber line from Bath &amp; Body Works, very warm and comforting.
I find that this gave my baby-fine hair a lot of body and shininess and it was easier to comb out while wet without tugging.  Very happy with it so far.

By morning there will be no white residue, and your hair will be big, fluffy and oil-free!)*",Coconut Miracle Oil Dry Shampoo
2020-11,4.0,It's an affordable shampoo. Considering that it's great. The scent is lovely - not too strong though. It cleans well. I like the fact that it's sulfate free. One thing is that it can dry out the hair so I advise anyone who uses this to use a good conditioner with it! It's definitely worth the money.,Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo
2020-08,4.0,"Somehow and someway this helps reduce the amount of hair falling when I wash my hair, although to a lesser degree than other products I've used in the past. I use this twice a week as I prefer not to wash my hair too often, and follow with the Coconut Milk Conditioner. The shampoo itself is a lovely pearlescent color and the aroma is simply gorgeous (very coconut-y) and quite strong, although it doesn't last for long on my hair once it's been blow dried. Used in conjunction with the Conditioner my hair does not end up frizzy or dry, like it does with most hair products, but shiny, soft and manageable. Even my hairdresser commented when I went in for a haircut recently. My only gripe is the bottle. When it's nearing the end I can't stand it upside-down to get the last of it out because of the rounded cap. Propping it up between my soap dish and the corner of my shower, it topples over regardless of how careful I am. Verdict: Works for me but not quite as effective or strong enough on hair loss to purchase a bottle specifically for that purpose. However for cleansing and frizz control this is brilliant and I will repurchase.

2018-08,5.0,"ive been trying out new shampoos since my pregnancy. I was having nausea so i couldnt use this but i LOVEEEE this scent when i am not pregnant lol. smells like waffles!
 since having the baby ive been experiencing hair loss and i had to come back to this. This is the shampoo i trust and will always come back to. I used to like herbal essences but it made my hair so greasy. The i love juicy shampoo from lush is great but its expensive and it was very drying. I also HATE HATE the love beauty planet ones, the tee trea and vetiver one made me bald and soooo itchy. I was losing double amount of hair i usually experience in the shower. So here we are, my tried and true. I love the smell and how it doesnt make my hair feel like its stripping all its moisture. It also lathers so nicely and i dont experience the terrible scary hair loss. The best part is that i dont get as greasy as the herbal essence. I think its because its not stripping of moisture so my scalp isnt compensating in making more oil.  I dont really care for the conditioner because i love my shae moisture coconut fruit weightless mask (so good!) I do not get itchy from this and just one wash i can tell a difference of how much my hair loves this shampoo! I have straight long asian hair thats med thick. This is the best ive tried in the drugstore.


edit- after 3 bottles of this i bought the large bottle! i am still using this and will continue to. I even got my bf to use this. Its none greasy and non drying, its the happy medium that i look for in a shampoo. I love the smell and i never get tired of it!

2018-08,3.0,"A few years ago there was a bit of a hullabaloo over sulphates in shampoos, as well as silicones and parabens in conditioners. It has to be said that a lot of the evidence suggesting these ingredients are bad for us is of poor quality and questionable validity. However, I did go through a period where I had colour-treated hair with a demi-permanent dye (Wella's Colour Touch) and the colour would fade super fast with run of the mill shampoos with lauryl and laureth sulphate compounds and the advice at the time was to try sulphate-free.

Tried a variety of products - baby shampoo, super expensive salon brands like Kerastase, kind natured shampoos, naked shampoos... and was underwhelmed by all of them. This shampoo is a little unusual as it has a jelly-like texture, something common to a lot of Organix shampoos, and does take a bit of work to lather effectively. I have oily, fine, porous hair and shampooing once wouldn't remove oil effectively, but a second shampoo and rinse would do the trick. The good thing was that it did extend the life of the colourant on my hair before it needed re-doing, so there was that. In combination with the coconut conditioner used on hair ends, it was shinier and softer. But now that I've returned to having un-dyed hair, I can't really justify using a shampoo that I have to use up twice as fast so that my hair is clean. 

Overall I don't think this is a terrible product, and it's worth a try if you want to extend wear time of semi-permanent or demi-permanent hair dyes. I no longer use the shampoo but I do still use the coconut conditioner from this brand. 

1 lipstick for the packaging as I absolutely hate the shape of these bottles. They are so, so bad and I can't believe Organix still uses these things. When the bottle is nearing empty, it's such hard work to get the last bits out because the shampoo is so viscous and jelly-like, and the bottles can't be stood upside-down.

Because I color my hair and want to do my best to keep the color as solid as possible(so I don't have to make as many trips to the salon), I was looking for a new SLS-free shampoo, and soon enough my attention was drawn to the line of OGX shampoos. A bit pricey, but still lower priced than your standard salon shampoos. I decided to look up some reviews online and the opinions on OGX shampoos were very mixed. The Coconut Milk seemed to be the highest rated shampoo out of the bunch. As desperate as I was for a new shampoo, I decided to bite the bullet and bought this shampoo.

THE PROS:
- Has a very pleasant Coconut scent that leaves your shower smelling nice
- Produces quite a lot of lather for an SLS free shampoo
- I didn't need a lot of product for my rather long hair, so I think the bottle could last me quite a while

THE CONS:
- It takes a LOT of work to rinse this out properly, and it's hard to feel when the product is completely washed out of your hair, so it's hard to tell if you've rinsed well enough
- This did nothing for my roots/scalp but made the ends of my hair VERY greasy. I find this odd, because the ends of my hair are usually quite dry.  Normally I'd wash my hair every 3 to 4 days. While using this shampoo, I have to wash my hair every day/every other day. This is a HUGE con for me, because I don't like greasy hair and I don't like washing it often because I don't want my color to fade too quick.

Conclusion: I should've listened to the negative reviews, and so should you, potential buyer! Don't buy this shampoo. There are lots of better shampoos on the market for a better price. This stuff weighs your hair down and makes it greasy. I don't want a shampoo to make my hair greasy, I want a shampoo to (gently!)clean my hair! Sorry OGX, but this shampoo is a disappointment.

2015-08,5.0,"I am Asian and my hair is long, fine, and stick straight with zero volume. It gets oily and limp quickly, although my ends dry out easily. My hair is relatively healthy, and I don't use heat or styling products in it. 

There are a lot of mixed reviews here and I was scared to purchase, but I figured I could return it in case it doesn't work out for me. The smell alone was enough for me to purchase it. It smells so so good, not like artificial coconuts, but like a creamy delicious authentic coconut. The scent is light, but lingers in my hair. My boyfriend can smell it only when his face is buried in my hair, so it isn't overwhelming, and won't clash with your perfume. 

The shampoo gives my locks the hydration it needs without weighing them down. A lot of people say their hair feels like straw, but I regularly use clarifying shampoos (LUSH Seanik, LUSH Big) and this is no where near as close to drying as those. It is a really great daily shampoo if you have oily roots and dry ends (in conjunction with the conditioner). The price is as good when you can find it on sale, and I will definitely be repurchasing!

By the end of the day I was back to the store I purchased these products from, waiting in the return line.  I was sick to my stomach from the cloying scent. I decided I would rather live with frizzy hair than to continue to smell that sweet coconut scent every time I turned my head.  I purchased another shampoo and conditioner.

I read a lot of reviews and finally bought as it was on sale at my local Superstore (along with the conditioner). I'd heard reviews of people noticing less hair loss and I noticed it, too. With the previous shampoo/conditioner combo I was using, I experienced a fair amount of hair loss/breakage. Now, next to none. The scent is nice, I'm in love with a lot of stuff coconut and it's not overpowering. I actually use the Coconut Water Hydration Oil if I want a little burst of scent. I also love how much more nourished and stronger my hair seems. My biggest flaws are the price (anywhere from $6-$11, depending where I go and if it's on sale) and the fact that the bottles don't show how much is left.

I've tried lots of shampoos, conditioners and styling products and every time my hair was limp, dry and frizzy. The volumizing products only seemed to add some stickiness to it,so things were getting a bit desperate until I found this. It cleans well, although I find I need to apply it twice for a good clean, and most importantly adds volume, texture and moisture to my hair. I don't need to use a conditioner and a few drops of hair oil (any) are enough to get rid of most of the frizz. Also, it smells nice and not too strong. The difference is remarkable when I try other shampoos, as my hair goes back to being flat and shapeless. I'm very glad I picked it out randomly - it's a bit of a lottery with OGX shampoos, there are so many to choose from! I will keep repurchasing.",Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo

Yesterday I was watching Essie Button's March favorites video and she mentioned this, and as my hair is only slightly longer than hers, I thought I could give it a try again.

2015-08,3.0,"I really like this. Here's why: It doesn't make my hair soft at all, it makes it quite dry, but that was what I was expecting. It's not the job's shampoo to make your hair soft, that's just not gonna happen. Shampoo cleans your hair and that could be quite drying. If doesn't make it dry, then it isn't cleaning it properly and it would become greasy in a day. But this shampoo brings my hair back to life. It's made it shiny and stronger, and for some reason blonder? I have a few blonde highlights that were just dead and grody and this shampoo brought them back from the dead. The trick with this is, don't use the matching conditioner because it sucks, it's runny and watery and your hair will be dry. I use this with dove's oil therapy conditioner and my hair's been loving it. It too has coconut oil in it and it's quite moisturizing so my hair IS silky and smooth all day, and it takes about four days for it to become greasy. ",Nourishing Coconut Milk Shampoo

This shampoo was very thick for my hair (I have slightly thick hair unless straightened) and while I thoroughly was it out, the next day I would constantly find flaky bits of shampoo stuck to the strands at the top of my scalp. The shampoo does not lather up and is a very thick consistency, most of the time making it hard to squeeze out of the bottle. It also left my scalp and the ends of my hair feeling very dry and brittle. I used the shampoo in conjunction with the matching conditioner, which again I was not thrilled about, and the coconut milk serum and the coconut spray which are amazing (I still use these!), however the shampoo and conditioner do nothing for my hair and leave it very dry and brittle.

It has a very strange consistency similar to jello but it doesn't really bother me.

 I've found it lathers pretty well and I get it at Walmart for about $5 which isn't bad, to me at least.

 It didn't leave my hair greasy, it actually felt pretty clean but after a few washes it didn't clean my hair as well and my hair would get very oily super easy. I have pretty long, about rib length hair that's naturally Blonde, it's pretty thick but I have fine hair so I have a lot of hair but it's indivual strands aren't super thick. Does that make sense?

 Anyways, this shampoo is okay but I probably wouldn't purchase it again.

2015-08,3.0,"I had been eying this particular Moroccan oil for a while and finally got around to making the purchase. At first I hated the product. My expectation of the texture was oil-like but instead it's serum-like. Very silky! I don't particularly like the fragrance which comes across as fabric softener or dish detergent. The first application was on dry flat ironed hair which did absolutely nothing for me. Since then I use it as directed, on damp towel dried hair, and I like it. It absorbs well and makes for lighter, softer wash n' goes. How I wish there was more Argan oil because as it is the formula is nothing special. There are plenty of other equivalent serums with other oils that perform just as well but are cheaper.

I have definitely noticed a difference since using this product, though.

2013-08,4.0,"Having heard all the raves about Argan oil, I was looking around for a product to try that wouldn't break the bank. I looked at similar products at a beauty supply store/salon, but all of those were priced way over the top. $14 for the cheapest one, and $30+ for others... Uhm, no. This one, available in most drug stores, wasn't the cheapest one on the shelves, but the golden hue was enticing, and the price was just right at about $8. The last time I repurchased, I took advantage of a sale at CVS and it ended up being about $6. A bottle lasts me 4-5 months or so.

Before I blow dry, I put a nickle-to-quarter size amount of this Moroccan Argan Penetrating Oil on my palms and rub them together to evenly coat my hands. (I have long hair, so if you have shorter hair, you definitely won't need that much.) Then I run my hands through the longest 1/2 of my hair with my head upside down. Then I flip my hair back up and use the remaining product on the palms of my hands to gloss over the top and back. Then I blow dry as usual. This really seems to help with fly-aways and frizz, as long as I'm careful to evenly distribute it throughout my hair. I'm not really sure how &quot;penetrating&quot; it is, but it works really well on the surface of my hair to make it softer, calmer, and shinier without weighing it down. The scent is subtle and pleasant, but I don't really notice that the scent lingers after my hair dries. I've also used tiny amounts of it on dry hair as a &quot;spot&quot; treatment for frizzy fly-aways, and it works well that way, too. 

Be aware, as others have mentioned, using it on wet hair that isn't blown dry doesn't yield the same results at all. In fact, I'd avoid using it on your hair if you're just going to let it air dry. Maybe it is the heat from the dryer that allows this product to evenly coat your hair and work magic? Who knows... it does work, though!",Renewing Argan Oil Morocco Penetrating Oil

The packaging is adorable bright Green. The consistency of the shampoo is a bit thick.  However,  dont let that scare you it wasnt at all too heavy on my oily scalp. It cleaned my hair i didnt need too use a large amount.  Tea tree has a lot of benefits for your hair helps with Oil &amp; Dandruff also dry patches on your scalp which i struggle with all three. Also helps with demodex mites which i struggled in the past with my skin more then my hair. I used this shampoo an the paul mitchell tea tree . Honestly this one is far more better I have included my reasons . Its also safe for color treated hair unlike most tea tree shampoos that fade your hair color this one doesn't because its sulfate free.  Overall i think its a great shampoo pricing is amazing too because its not more then $8.00 an it comes in two sizes . First size is 13 fl oz i have found it at Walmart for $5.00 the second size is 19.5 fl oz which i also purchased at Walmart  an it was on sale for $6.75 so thats a bargin. It lasts forever.

It made my longish, thick,course and wavy hair a tangled feeling mess!. It felt striped of all oils, I had to put argon dry oil on it to even able to attempt to comb the tangles out.
Another thing I want to add here...-  The tea tree oil and peppermint oil are both KNOWN to kill DEMODEX MITES, they live,are hatched and die inside hair follicles and pores. That is why some people in these reviews felt an itchiness in their scalps that hadn't been there before  use. They had &quot;aggravated&quot; the mites. Of which all humans have but few ever notice until something aggravates them. Then they're hell on earth for the person affected. Look them up online many articles to learn more about them. Most have photographs of the mites.
When this shampoo came into contact with pores that were nests to the mites it started to kill them, some would've been longer to be affected and others could've fled down the neck or into the ears.

2015-08,1.0,"Organix SUCKS!!!!.
I ve tried it a few times...when it first came out and when it was on sale. Nope. It sucks. It leaves my hair totally unmanageable. It does have a minty smell, but leaves no smell at all in my long, thick, wavy hair...I do like my hair to smell nice and I do have to say that is one of the factors for me when I add a new shampoo or conditioner into my hair care rotation..... 
Basically, this shampoo is all hype... all jelly--no toast.. blah, blah, blah. It didn't do anything spectacular for my hair except make it a tangled mess for me to detangle and THAT really pissed me off. It was like I didn't use any conditioner and I have a few different shampoos from other countries that I LOVE AND HAVE NO CONDITIONER AND THEY STILL WORK GREAT!!!! not Organix!!!!!
Anyway.....boo to this stuff. MAYBE MY Hair NEEDS The Sulfates Or WHAT EVER they are leaving OUT.....either way...I'm DONE trying AND buying Organix. It doesn't work for me...I'm ok with sulfates and parabens....not a problem for my hair because It is tough I guess :-) ",Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo
2015-08,2.0,"Let's talk about the big elephant in the room-for one- this brand is anything but organic. The play on the word &quot;organics&quot; is very misleading and apparently the less-than-stellar reviews seem to accurately reflect the quality of the &quot;pure and simple&quot; products by &quot;Organi-x&quot; (Well now it's been changed to OGX). 

I have low porosity, 3c/4a hair and my biggest issue is chronic dryness. 

In fairness, I purchased just the shampoo, and it was average. (Usually the results are better in conjunction to using with the conditioner...) but It's not so much that the product &quot;dried out&quot; my hair or &quot;damaged&quot; it...it just did nothing for me. The smell is disturbingly artificial- similar to synthetic soap with a subtle hint of mint ( maybe tea tree I don't know.) And you would think that an ingredients such as peppermint and tea tree are sustainable and relatively cheap essential oils, I'm baffled as to why I can't even detect it in the shampoo. . . 

Overall, this shampoo is an over-hyped, generic shampoo that doesn't deliver on their promises. The only positive feedback I can give for this sub-par product is that their bottle designs are cute, and it didn't &quot;damage or dry&quot; my hair. ",Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo
2015-08,3.0,"I have very thick long hair. I sort of like this shampoo and sort of don't. As another person said, it is bogus and crappy the fact that they play up on the word organic when this product is definitely not and it is more pricey that what it should be. I find that irritating. I do loveee the smell even if it is fake and not of essential oils. (partially why I went back to this shampoo, the smell alone I like). Smells fresh and unique, it does feel a little minty on my scalp when washing and that feels nice. My hair is beautiful, soft and shiny hydrated after using BUT the most annoying thing I find is that, my scalp is itchy after..soo I probably won't buy again :(. It's funny that my scalp would be itchy and have some bumps after a shampoo that has tea tree and mint..since tea tree usually helps with that type of thing so it must be the other chemicals and ingredients in this that my skin finds irritating. Sucks because I do like the feel of my hair after and love the smell. I have used the morrocan argan oil shampoo from this brand and I like it but my hair isn't as soft as it is with the tea tree mint. Their Kukui oil shampoo/conditioner, I didn't like at all..left my hair dry and gross. ",Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo
2014-08,5.0,"The packaging is a bit bulky but very sturdy. Everyone is saying that this product dries out their hair but honestly it's so moisturizing and leaves my long, fine hair feeling like silk. It's sulfate-free and cleans amazingly without leaving my scalp dry and tight. The consistency is a gel-like green formula which is great for my oily roots and dry ends. If you are super prone to dryness I would skip this &amp; go for a formula that is more rich and creamy but for me it moisturizes my hair beautifully. Even thought it's not the cheapest for the amount you get this is the only shampoo from the drugstore that is truly gentle and sulfate free which is HUGE for me since sulfate filled shampoos leave my scalp so tight, dry, itchy and frizzy. I absolutely adore the mint chocolate chip scent but I can understand why other people would dislike it.",Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo
2014-08,5.0,"I absolutely love Organix and their products. I use several of their products, and this is my staple item. It always leaves my hair really clean and fresh. 

I have very thick, coarse, frizzy hair, and am frequently applying oils and using shampoos and conditioners to help make my hair shiny. Sometimes if I use too many products or silky shampoos, my hair will produce too much natural oil, and even after a fresh wash might start to appear oily. 

When that happens, all I need is one good wash with my Tea Tree Mint Shampoo and Conditioner. It cleanses my hair to a more natural form without stripping it. While washing, the mint invigorates my scalp and makes me feel awake while the tea tree oil leaves my hair moisturized but not oily. It lathers very nicely, smells very nice, and makes my hair feel really clean. It replenishes my hair to a nice clean state, but still takes away unwanted frizz. After the shower, my hair is naturally soft and healthy!

This is the first Organix product I tried, and it is still one of my favorites. The price is incredible, and the results are worth triple the price at least. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a shampoo/conditioner that will clean your hair well while also making it soft and healthy for a great price!

Organix does not even use organic ingredients, it just plays on the name to confuse people and convince them to pay more for inferior products and non-organic ingredients.

2014-08,3.0,"I have tried a lot of the Organix shampoo and conditioners and I find that either they are pretty good or not that great at all. This one has a really good smell that I love but what makes me ultimately not like it is the fact that it doesn't make my hair soft or untangled enough to even brush out after my shower. I feel like most moisturizing shampoos/conditioners leave your hair soft and this one left it feeling pretty rough and not manageable. It is more of a clarifying shampoo, so I guess that's why it doesn't really make it too soft. It lathers well but that doesn't matter to me. The smell is enough to make me finish the bottle but after its gone I will not be repurchasing, just cause I prefer something that will make my hair soft and healthy feeling instead of rough and overly clean. ",Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo
2014-08,5.0,"This is a great shampoo because it gives a deep clean while actually moisturizing your hair at the same time. I bleach my hair, so as a result I have pretty dry ends, but my roots get super oily. Clarifying shampoos get all the grease out of my roots but tend to leave my ends tangled and dry. Moisturizing shampoos keep my ends looking healthy, but make my roots look like I haven't washed my hair in weeks. This has been a lifesaver because it gives me a thorough clean, but it makes my hair feel soft, shiny, and manageable. Added bonus -- I've been dealing with a dry scalp latley, and using this regularly seems to really have helped.

This stuff smells amazing -- I don't notice any tea tree scent, just a super minty smell. If you're not a mint lover, though, I haven't noticed the scent of this lingering in my hair, so no worries. The consistency of this is kind of weird. It comes out in almost gel-like blobs. It's not runny or slippery at all like most shampoos are. Because of the consistency, I find that I have to use quite a bit of this to get it to lather in my hair. But if I use enough, this gives a nice lather and it rinses clean -- no residue or coated feeling in the hair afterwards. 

I'll definitely be picking this up again, and I'll be trying more from this line (I believe the line is  called OGX now). I recommend this to anyone who likes minty scents in the shower, and anyone who needs a lilttle extra moisture in their their hair or scalp. ",Hydrating + Tea Tree Mint Shampoo

2014-08,3.0,"I have used this product (and its matching conditioner) for about half a year. I have tried the other ones as well.

The tea tree mint shampoo for me is best served as a clarifying shampoo. I personally love the scent (reminds me of mint chocolate chip), and am not bothered by it. 

Then again, I also love mint chocolate chip ice cream, so that may have something to do with it. 

It does leave my hair dry after use, but it also removes build up fairly well. I think there are better shampoos out there (for the same price) with equally pleasant scents that do a better job, but until I find one I will continue to use this one. I use this one once a week as I use a lot of pomades and wax products.

I have short hair, so that may be why this shampoo is tolerable for me. Judging by the other reviews, if you have curly hair or medium to long hair this is likely not the shampoo for you.

Without the conditioner, it might dry your hair out. When I followed up with the conditioner, I used it on the bottom half and waited 5 minutes before washing it out, but when I felt my hair, the top was a little dry compared to the rest, so I put a little on the top and waited about 10-15 seconds before washing it out and it felt the same.

I do have color treated hair but I had no problems with it affecting my bleach blonde. In fact, my hair feels soft, looks beautiful, and smells great! Let me tell you, when lathering (and it does lather well) the smell is very strong, but after washing it out it's noticeable but much more subtle.

It lathers up fine and my hair definitely needs conditioner after I wash it, but I find that to be the case with most natural shampoos. I don't think it lives up to its hydrating claims, so I probably won't repurchase.

I decided to start using coconut and neem oil as a pre-shampoo treatment.  The neem oil is good on hair but oh my word does it stink!  I use this as a lightly rinsing shampoo when doing that treatment because the minty smell removes the stench of the neem oil,  and my hair does not seem to lose the benefit of the prewash the way that the Ion clarifying shampoo I used the first time in an attempt to get out the smell.

&lt;p&gt;The tea tree is their hydrating formula. I would say that I love the smell and the lathering capabilities of the formula. At first it was difficult to get a lather going and I would have to shampoo twice but now the trick is to rub and emulsify the product in your hands before you apply to your hair. 

&lt;p&gt;The shampoo I feel moisturizes as much as a shampoo can get. It's not super moist but I've never found any shampoo to really do that. It doesn't overly dry out my hair and preps it well for conditioner and styling.

&lt;p&gt;I don't mind the bottles too much. I adore their use of disposable inks for their writing. After a couple of uses you might notice some of the writing on your bottle is gone but hey that is a plus for the environment!!!! Yays!

Frizz Defy + Coconut Miracle Oil Air Dry Cream to the rescue...

You apply a small amount to just-washed, still damp hair [my hair is thick, so for me it's one pump for the left half and one for the right], and that's it - just leave your hair to dry naturally. The cream has a coconut fragrance that is hard to distinguish once the product has been applied, apart from the occasional whiff when my hair blows into my face, and my hands aren't left with a greasy film after applying the product, which is a good sign.

I was stunned. This is something that gives results from the first use onwards. My hair is almost 100% frizz free, feels very silky, doesn't look lank or greasy, doesn't tangle anywhere near as much and feels more lightweight than usual.  My hair has a kink to it and if I don't meddle with my hair whilst its drying,  the cream bolsters it. If I keep brushing through the lengths as its drying,  my hair will be more or less straight and will stay that way til I wash it again. 

",Frizz Defy + Coconut Miracle Oil Air Dry Cream
2020-08,4.0,"A very good conditioner which softens and moisturizes my hair. I use it straight after the Coconut Milk shampoo. It's quite emollient and rich in texture, but yet doesn't leave my hair and scalp oily like most other conditioners do. It also doesn't weight it down or make it frizzy. Not to mention it smells literally like heaven. If you like coconut-scented things then you'll love this! My only wish is that it would last longer than the hour or so that it does. Price is also good, I can usually pick up a 13 oz bottle for just under $6 USD from Target, which is brilliant value considering how long one bottle lasts for. My only complaint has to be the bottle itself, no matter how much I try and shake the conditioner out, I just cannot get the last one-fifth or so out of the bottle and end up cutting the bottle in half just to scoop out what's left. Not that this is a pricey conditioner, I just don't like unnecessary wastage. Other than that it's hard to fault this and I'll definitely be re-purchasing.

2018-08,2.0,"This smells amazing. It de-tangled my curly, coarse &amp; dry hair well enough. But when my hair dried, it poofed up into a frizz ball and turned crunchy. Then was dry for a week. I had to clarify and deep condition repeatedly. Nothing redeeming about this one other than the scent.
This worked decently on my child with normal straight hair. ",Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner
2018-08,4.0,"This conditioner seems to be the Marmite of conditioners - hate it or love it, and no in-between.
I no longer use Organix shampoos, as my hair gets quite oily and now that it's no longer dyed there's no reason for me to use sulphate-free cleansers. I have to shampoo &amp; rinse 2 to 3 times in the shower with sulphate-free stuff as quite simply, they are not as effective at stripping oil and build up from my scalp and hair. If I want to protect hair colour's lifespan on my head then yes, it's great - but other than that it just wastes money.

I still use Organix conditioners and leave-in oils at the ends - they just seem to agree with my fine,wavy, porous hair and don't weigh it down like crazy. If your hair is coarser and less porous (i.e. hair dyes show up on your hair less) then this probably won't work for you, and I can imagine it would be very underwhelming. It's worth a try if you have fine hair like me as it won't leave a thick &quot;waxy&quot; coating like some conditioners.

The organix bottle shapes though, oh my God. It's worse for the conditioners since they are thicker and more viscous than the shampoos, once they are half empty you need superhuman strength to squeeze the bottle hard enough to get some of the conditioner out. Wish Organix would sort it out!",Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner

I gave this another go when I travelled overseas to Hawaii. Humid temps, I was dreading the havoc it was about to do to my hair. Picked this up at a corner shop in a travel size and was disappointed again. The hotels shampoo/cond. was better quality.

I rather enjoy this conditioner, it has a slightly milky texture and runs pretty thin for a conditioner. Being aware that this is not a mask it does not intend to be very thick to begin with. I enjoy the way this makes my hair feel and think it does a good job in working up a good slip in my hair without leaving it feeling gross afterwards. Not the best, certainly not the worst.

First time Organix user. I spent a lot of time wondering about this product. I read a lot of reviews and finally bought as it was on sale at my local Superstore (along with the shampoo). I'd heard reviews of people noticing less hair loss and I noticed it, too. With the previous shampoo/conditioner combo I was using, I experienced a fair amount of hair loss/breakage. Now, next to none. The scent is nice, I'm in love with a lot of stuff coconut and it's not overpowering. I actually use the Coconut Water Hydration Oil if I want a little burst of scent. I also love how much more nourished and stronger my hair seems. My biggest flaws are the price (anywhere from $6-$11, depending where I go and if it's on sale) and the fact that the bottles don't show how much is left.

It's a very lightweight conditioner and also help with defining the waves and curls in my hair. However, I only get good results if I use a ton of it. I'm talking like, golf ball size amount every time, like what you would do with a deep conditioner. I've used it before only using a small quarter size amount and it wasn't moisturizing enough.

2015-08,5.0,"I'm so surprised to see this product has such low reviews because it really is a gem for me.  I can't believe I can buy it cheaply from my local pharmacy! 

My hair is seriously hard work - it's very fine stranded but thick in quantity, curly, dry and damaged from being highlighted blonde for over a decade - all of which equal massively tangle-prone. I often got matts in my hair, it would snap off when I tried to detangle, I couldn't grow it. I've been a high-end product junkie - if you see the pictures in my profile, there's one from a few years ago of my shelf stacked with Kerastase, Redken, Bumble &amp; Bumble, Joico, Philip Kingsley products...not pictured are the Shu Uemura and Philip B products that cost a fortune! I've spent way too much on products! After trying a very niche range - the George Michael line for long hair, specially imported from Germany, which was lovely and finally got my hair to BSL, but eye wateringly expensive - I got a Brazilian Blowout and was given simple Alterna products to use, kicking my HE junkie habit. Months after the blowout washed out I was still using the Alterna products. I eventually found I had run out and went to my local pharmacy to buy 'emergency' conditioner. I needed moisture and love the smell of coconut so went for this! 

I was very happy with the results so have kept it at the centre of my haircare routine. This conditioner has clicked in as the final - and yay, affordable! - piece of the jigsaw of my perfect hair routine. I still use the Alterna Bamboo shampoo and follow it with a generous (walnut sized) squeeze of conditioner. I leave it in 5 minutes while brushing my teeth and washing my face. I then take my tangle teezer - my hair by this point is totally softened - and comb through my hair in the shower. I rinse out the conditioner and my hair naturally dries into soft, silky loose curls. It smells lovely too! I have to wash my hair every other day to keep the silkiness but I'm fine with this as it prevents matts forming. The real miracle for me is that I can get a silky blow dry finish with absolute minimal effort, which I never thought would happen. I use a smoothing product, either Kerastase Elixir Ultime or KMS Smoothing Creme, then alternate brushing through with a paddle brush and blasting with the dryer. Towards the end I give some shape with a round bristle brush. It takes 15 minutes and doesn't look frizzy/fuzzy as my DIY blowdries always used to look - it looks smooth! I have owned both my styling products for longer than this conditioner and only in combination with it have they been so effective - so I'm giving the bulk of the credit to Organix. (For complete disclosure I also take Phytophanere supplements and occasionally do oil treatments with coconut oil or pure argan oil - perhaps every couple of months).

So this conditioner forms part of a repertoire of products for me, but it stands out as the only product to help me conquer tangles (a saviour!) and get a silky blow dry (a real first for me!) - and all for £7.99, about a third of the price of my average product before. I'm a VERY happy customer! ",Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner

The scent lingers for a bit too, and despite being &quot;fake coconut&quot; it still made me feel like a tropical princess each time I cleansed my hair. I now use coconut and monoi oil too.  I've used other shampoos/conditioners on my hair but I keep coming back to this one because it works for me, and it's been a year. This is the first shampoo/conditioner I've really liked.",Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner

I use virgin coconut oil as an overnight conditioning treatment once a week and it's so good for defining my wavy hair and getting rid of the frizz, so I looked for coconut ANYTHING to use in between.

2013-08,4.0,"I LOVE this conditioner! It's the only conditioner I have used that doesn't dry out my coarse, thick, dry, frizzy hair. It doesn't weigh it down and it actually hydrates my hair, not just coat it with silicone. I use it with the shampoo and serum and it's awesome. I'm already on my 3rd bottle. The only con is that the conditioner always runs out before the shampoo. 

Update: I still love this conditioner, it's just I've found a way more hydrating one from the drugstore. The Aveeno Pure naturals seaweed one. I just love the way the scent lingers in my hair and it smells so good!",Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner

I bought a little travel sized version of this last night because my husband and I stayed the night without planning in a different state. I refuse to use hotel shampoo and conditioner, ick. This smelled amazing and felt really good on my hair. I left it in for about 10 minutes like I do with any conditioner and when I rinsed out it felt soft as silk when wet and really smooth when dry. I even blow dryed it and my hair tends to get frizzy. So yeah, I liked this quite a bit. Only 3 star rating cuz I have to use it more to decide just how much I like it",Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner

The positives end there.
This conditioner just isn't rich enough. I tried using a ton of it, and leaving it in for longer than 5 minutes to see if that would help moisturize my hair. It made no difference. I feel like this product may be even damaging my hair since I can't get a comb through it after my shower and when I do it pulls it out!

2013-08,5.0,"Absolutely love this. I have used Organix Coconut Shampoo and Conditioner for at least 6 months. My hair is thick, coarse and naturally curly but I have it straightened. Before using Organix products, due to many times of hair permanent straightening and colour-dyeing, my hair was so dry and not shiny at al. I was looking and trying so many products including high-end expensive ones like Loreal Profestional, Goldwell, Kerastase and some else I don't remember but none of them improve the condition of my hair until I try Organix Coconut. At first, I was reluctant to try it cause I tried Organix Cherry Blossom before and it dried out my hair. However, the chemist store around my area had it in a cheap deal so I decided to give it a try. And my first experience with Organix Coconut was seriously amazing. My hair looks clean, hydrated, straight and shiny. Especially, my hair-lost condition immediately disappeared after the first use. This is amazing cause I used to have a lot of hair lost. Highly recommend!

This conditioner is just below equal or equal to my other stuff. It was amazing at sealing me split ends and conditioning the inch left in my hair that is still color treated. I use this after my other brand salon shampoo and the conditioner works really good whether I use a sulfate free or sulfate formula. It is not heavy on my hair at all and I do not notice buildup. The results were best when I started using the Organix coconut milk  leave-in cream. I will review that too.",Nourishing Coconut Milk Conditioner

2020-08,5.0,It helps my hair hold texture and smells amazing. Could be used as a hair perfume as well. ,Sea Salt Spray
2016-08,4.0,"Let's face it, my hair is generally a lost cause.  It's very fine and very slick (doesn't hold style for long).  This spray gives me all day texture and body without the goopy and/or crusty feeling of most styling products.  It actually makes my hair feel thicker.  Smells great too!  I will sometimes use this in conjunction with the Organix Bamboo Fiber Full Root Boost Spray (which also smells fantastic) and they add manageable body and texture to my often-boring hair.

Only con is the packaging - the bottle can be a bit hard to hold after a while.  It easily implodes due to the suction from the spray and the lack of air making its way back into the bottle.  If you release the top after every use it keeps the bottle plump, which is easier to hold.  Just a bit of an inconvenience.",Sea Salt Spray
2015-08,4.0,I love love this because it smells great and it doesnt make my hair weird or crunchy (like some sprays). But it doesn't also do anything special to it other than make it shiny and nice smelling (which is what I use it for anyway). If you're looking for a beachy look the john frieda version of this works well for me! ,Sea Salt Spray
2015-08,4.0,"To start off, I bought this product at my local CVS as a summer alternative to my usual curl cream. The price was decent, on par with any other Organix product. I would buy it again once I run out.

I have extremely wavy hair with some defined curl. I used this product like I would do with any other curl product I use. ON NEARLY SOPPING WET HAIR.

The smell is just wonderful, I wish there was a perfume with this scent. I like that it's in the spray bottle, no sticky hands or having to worry about &quot;slip&quot;. It does not work well on already dry or mostly dry hair. It makes my hair feeling dry and tangled.

If you do want to purchase this product, use it on hair that's come right out of the shower and scrunch lightly. (I usually scrunch up around my roots to give me some lift and then twist strands around a finger to define waves)

As I don't have straight hair or have had any friends with straight hair try it, I don't know how it works with it. If anything it might be a good texture spray and scent.",Sea Salt Spray
2015-08,4.0,"The smell of this is intoxicating  -- beachy without overloading the coconut, along the lines of the Moroccanoil scent which I love but less candylike. It works well as a perk up for my too-soft curly hair that can go limp when there is too little humidity. Could work on sopping wet hair to intensify curl. Seems to be going up in price. ",Sea Salt Spray
2015-08,3.0,"I got this on sale. I have thick, wavy hair, and I guess I'll just have to accept that my favorite beach spray (L'Oreal EverStyle in the purple bottle that smells SOOOO good) is just never going to be made again. This is actually ok. It hasn't been giving my hair a whole lot of texture, but it hasn't been making it crazy frizzy either. The smell is pretty wonderful, too. Not a huge fan of organix/ogx products in general, and I'll have to update later, but get it on sale--it's alright. ",Sea Salt Spray
2014-08,3.0,"I thought this product would be perfect for me because I normally spray the OGX Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil on my hair first, followed by Not Your Mother's Beach Babe Sea Salt Spray (a combo which gives my thick, wavy hair the best &quot;beachy&quot; look). So when I found this product by OGX that combined the Moroccan oil with the salt spray, I thought I'd be in heaven. Especially because I absolutely LOVE every other OGX product I've ever used. HOWEVER, I do not like this product at all. It makes my hair feel dry, straw-like, and really frizzy. My hair appears fried whenever I use this product. The only way I can use it is if I apply a good amount of moisturizing serum (I like Giovanni Frizz Be Gone) to the ends before I spray the salt spray all over. I will not repurchase the OGX salt spray. 

I highly recommend Not Your Mother's Beach Babe salt spray over this! ",Sea Salt Spray
2014-08,3.0,"It is ok. Too much in my hair makes it crunchy, but too little doesn't give me any wave. I think this may be for people who already have some wave. My hair is just to straight to scrunch. I do looove the smell, so I use it as a light texturizing spray when I put my hair up.",Sea Salt Spray
2013-08,1.0,"This is unfortunately one of those cheap products that DOESN'T match up to it's expensive competitors. Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Spray is by far better than this. You'd think the solution wouldn't be that complicated, but I swear B&amp;B Surf Spray is worth it's price. 

This stuff did not hold the waves in place. It made my hair extremely dry and crunchy, as if I sprayed hairspray starch in it. Within hours, my hair just looked like I got electrocuted. Far from the beachy, boho waves I was going for. 

This isn't worth. My experience with the Organix brand so far has not been good. Their products are cool in concept, but poor in performance. ",Sea Salt Spray
2013-08,4.0,Not sure if its gimmicky or not but I bought it right before a Florida vacation.  Loved loved loved it.  I have curly textured hair and this gave it a really fun shape and feel.

2020-08,3.0,Typical ,Macadamia Oil Conditioner
2020-08,5.0,"Excellent! This is much more effective at what it's supposed to do than the Macadamia Oil shampoo. I'll probably have to pair this with the Coconut Milk shampoo (my fave from the OGX shampoo line-up so far). The Macadamia Oil conditioner leaves my hair tangle-free and nicely moisturized without weighing it down The texture is quite thick (in comparison to other conditioners) and silky. I apply from a few mm above the roots, right through to the ends, focusing on the ends especially, and leave it on for about 5 minutes before rinsing out and allowing my hair to dry naturally. Smells absolutely gorgeous, resulting in equally lovely smelling hair, and doesn't leave my hair oily nor flat. Excellent for taming frizz too. Will re-purchase.

One tip: If you use it with the Macadamia Shampoo combo just apply the shampoo in the roots (don't spread it because it will dry your hair), wash it off then use the conditioner all over your hair, leave it for 5 minutes and you'll have amazing results!",Macadamia Oil Conditioner
2014-08,4.0,"Very awkward shaped bottle, but it's what inside that counts, right?
On my over bleached, extremely damaged hair this was pure heaven.  Since my hair was so ruined I used it to co-wash my hair.
After the first use my hair was smooth, silky and tangle free as hair should be.
The next few times I used it I was still very pleased with the result, but I began to notice a build up on my roots that felt oily to the touch (this was the only product I used on my hair at the time).  Nothing a gentle shampoo didn't sort though.

You have to make sure to really rinse it out well however the extra time is worth it for me. It has a creamy consistency, dark yellow color, and smells wonderful. The scent does not linger unfortunately once my hair dries fully but I can tolerate that. It leaves my hair with great shine and softness and does feel very moisturizing. My hair air-dries less frizzy and with good texture. My curls look more bouncier. It is a light protein conditioner with keratin, so if protein sensitive you may not like this too much.

I am always willing to try new products once I run out of whatever I've been using.... so when I looked up reviews for Organix and saw that this particular line got good reviews, I decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I did!!! It's unlike anything else I've tried in that the shampoo lathers very well for a sulfate/paraben free product (at least compared to others I've tried) and the conditioner really feels more like a creamy oil. It smells yummy and left my hair feeling very pampered, silky, and shiny. Even though it doesn't leave my hair feeling weighed down, I will still use a clarifying shampoo/cond once a week to keep it from getting any build-up. ",Macadamia Oil Conditioner
2013-08,5.0,"I am an employee at Walgreens, so when I saw that Organix line was on sale BOGOF, I decided to give it a go. Last time I used Organix, I received the 'Cherry Blossom Ginseng' shampoo and conditioner as a gift. It was absolutely horrible! I have very color treated, wavy/curly medium-thickness hair. Every time I use cream conditioners they tend to be way to heavy on my hair and leave the roots greasy. My hair will feel like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks! But after watching many beauty gurus on YouTube, anything with macadamia oil seemed to be considered God sent, so I immediately decided to choose the macadamia shampoo and conditioner from the Organix line. Best decision I've made in a while! I noticed the difference immediately just by the texture of the conditiner in my hand. It has a very slick feel to it, you can definitely feel the oil in it. I put a rather large helping of this conditioner in my hair in the shower and left it on for about five minutes. When I washed it out I could feel the oil slicked in my wet hair and it got me worried! But when my hair dried it was so shiny and soft! The oil is so light that it gives your hair a shiny finish. It's not heavy at all, so it didn't weigh down my hair and make it feel greasy. It gave my hair a nice coat of polish. That's how I look at it! I absolutely love it! I've been using it everyday for about 6 months now an it's my new favorite! I never have an issue with buildup, or any irritation with the scalp.

It really feels like it needs conditioning after using the shampoo, but this replenishes it well.  Its not super thick do was skeptical, but as long as I use my leave in conditioner before styling its all good.  My fair feels so soft and light but still manageable. My only gripe, I tend to get build up after a few uses and need to clarify, not sure if its the oils or if its because the shampoo is so gentle that it doesn't remove all my styling products, but that's not a big deal.

I will note that I did use the shampoo with the conditioner.  

Economy ~ Although it comes in a 13 OZ Bottle A Little go's a very long way. Even so It's worth every dime. 1 bottle can range from 7.99 to 9.50 us price. Once in Awhile you can catch a deal such as purchasing 1 bottle getting another Free &lt;- at any local Walgreens. The Bottle itself is Eco Friendly to add to that the results are fabulous. For me it's worth every cent plus some. Considering I was back and forth to other Salon hair products that cost twice as much. I consider it a fabulous deal.

2012-08,2.0,"This condioner is such a great find! It makes my hair really shiny, and soft. I use it after the matching shampoo and it doesn't seem all that moisturizing at first, and doesn't give much slip. You have to leave it on for 3-5 minutes like the bottle says. After that time it made my hair like silk! Some conditioners leave your hair feeling super soft and moisturized, others leave your hair strong, smooth, and shiny. This is the latter, and it adds just enough weight to keep my slightly wavy hair from frizzing. It smells like candy and the price is good too! I will definitely keep this in my rotation, love this stuff!
UPDATE: this ended up really drying my hair out. I think it's all the silicones :/",Macadamia Oil Conditioner

I did not notice a huge difference. I used it last night as a leave-in a washed it out this morning. My hair feels soft and most importantly, moisturized. It feels a bit greasy but I prefer that over dry hair. It may be because I did not wash all of it out? Either way, this stuff seems to do a good job. ",Macadamia Oil Conditioner

Organix and L'Oreal were brands recommended and easily accessible (Walmart, Target), especially for a busy mom.

I usually use a hair mask or coconut oil for my curls. This conditioner, on the other hand, is great. I washed my hair with the matching shampoo, then I put the conditioner in my hair for about 10 minutes. It smells great, but it made my curls very soft and manageable.

2020-08,3.0,"I tend to find OGX's shampoos and conditioners are either a hit or a miss for me. This one seems to sit somewhere in the middle. It does a decent enough job at cleaning my hair without leaving it lank or frizzy. It smells gorgeous and it doesn't weigh my hair down at all. But there are a couple of issues: firstly I struggle to get the shampoo out once past the halfway mark. Really wish it came with a pump dispenser rather than a flip-top lid. Secondly, I find that over time it doesn't clean or remove build-up well enough, which is when I notice the return of the itchy scalp and dandruff problem. The only way I could keep using this is by alternating every few days with a clarifying shampoo or by adding a small amount of organic ACV to it in the palm of my hand, before applying to hair/scalp. Not bad but I'm unlikely to re-purchase.

2018-08,5.0,"Most OGX shampoos are very drying and their conditioners not moisturising enough. This particular one is one of the exceptions, the shampoo feels moisturising and doesn't strip my hair the way the other ones do. I feel like it's infused with more moisturising factors, and it feels like it's a milder + gentler formula on both the hair and the scalp. After finishing the bottles, I found that generally my hair was healthier to look at and not as frizzy. It looked shinier/silkier, there was definitely some improvement. This is one of the few OGX shampoo/conditioner combos that I would buy again.",Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo

I am pleased that I did not pay full price as it was not a good buy! Used shampoo and conditioner the other night and although the shampoo felt nice to use, one of the products left my hair feeling very dry. I do have dry, damaged fine hair and this made it worse.

2015-08,5.0,"I have used the matching conditioner for this for a long time but never really wanted to use the shampoo, I just thought it would be really thick and heavy and make my hair really oily, but I was so wrong! I wish I had tried it sooner. I am a bit on the fence with Organix shampoos, on the one hand they are one of the few brands that don't make my scalp itch or give me dandruff, in fact the Sea Mineral shampoo actually worked for me as a anti-dandruff shampoo so that's pretty good if you have dandruff but don't want to use the chemicals in the usual anti-dandruff shampoos, but there is sometimes something not quite right about them, too drying or doesn't feel like it cleans properly, builds up too much etc, but this shampoo turned out to be quite light and thin and spread through my hair easily and lathered well and it's left my hair shiny and moisturised without being oily and I still have volume in my hair so it's perfect actually, my hair is also a bit damaged at the ends from straightening it, and this had made a really big difference.  Whether it will build up over time I don't know, but still you just have to alternate with a different one to fix that, so yeah, if you have every considered buying it and you like the conditioner it's worth giving it a go!",Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo

2015-08,4.0,"I decided to try this shampoo and conditioner because I read on a forum for people with curly hair, that this shampoo is good for controlling frizz and making curls look defined. I was skeptical at first, when I noticed that liquid silicone is one of the first ingredients, before macadamia oil, but it works really well. My hair is really shiny and my curls are well defined.
I put a dab of it back in my hair after I rinse it, so that it controls frizz better, and it works really well. It also helps make it more manageable. (if I rinse it out completely, I get knots in my hair).
It might seem expensive, but it's worth it. The bottles only look small because of the shape. One thing they could improve is the shape of the cap. It would be nice if I could stand it upside-down when it's almost empty, so I can get the last little bit out of the bottle easier.",Hydrating Macadamia Oil Shampoo

2014-08,5.0,"I have long, fine, easy to frizz, straight Asian hair, while my scalp is on the oily side. I shampoo my hair daily, so I use a lot of shampoo, and I need something that will clean my scalp, but the same time it won't weight down my hair, and control the frizz.

I've been using Organix hair products since about a year ago, and I've tried many of them, I'm completely hooked, this is the only brand of hair products I'm using now besides few other products from Loreal. (Originally I choose Organix for the reason of sulfate-free, and Loreal eversleek for silicone-free).

All Organix shampoo I've tried are good, some of them, like the argan cream one is on the heavier side. My most favorite so far are the Macadamia oil shampoo, for its smell; and the Sea mineral shampoo, for its result, but it smells not so good in my opinion.

Macadamia oil shampoo smells just like ... fresh sugarcane and/or real watermelon juice ! I'm a Taiwanese, and both sugarcane and watermelon are very common fruits there. It's a scent hard to describe, not perfumy, not floral, not fruity, not nutty (although it's macadamia oil ...), not really grassy but a bit green, not sugary ... ok, I'm not being any helpful here.

2019-08,4.0,"I don't like hairspray. I don't like hairstyling products much period. Since my 30's I decided I couldn't really rely on youth for beauty anymore, and Becky Birdnest needed to get a hair style.  

I don't live in a very humid place, but a very temperamental one. If you don't like the weather in Texas, wait a minute. It is always unimaginably windy here, and can go from glaring sunshine to pouring rain and over 100 degrees again in minuets, so your hair style better be durable. This is why I decided on this product. I regularly use OGX shampoo and conditioner, and it has completely changed my life. This hairspray is in that category. It made my frizzy, thin, wavy, unruly hair behave beautifully!

It says it is a medium hold, that is true. It is also build-able. I would say it has a pretty stiff hold.   It says that it smooths frizzy hair and gives shine. This is also correct. It says it is long lasting. Maybe a little too much. 

I use the OGX shampoo, which is sulphate free. For clarifying, I use the Bamboo Volumizing one, since it cleans pretty deep. One wash couldn't completely remove the residue. I don't want to have to go back to sulphate shampoo or strip my hair to use this product, but with the style I wore, I might of applied too heavily. Next time I will be lighter handed.  It did not damage my hair, it did not dry it out. It held up in the wind tunnel like wind of spring and the sweat of the heat. I don't like the hairspray smell it has,  but my YSL hair mist did a good job of keeping under control.

2020-08,2.0,"I was so happy to finally find a scalp treatment that didn’t smell like tea tree or mint. It won’t replace legit dandruff products and the effect is mild, but it still helps somewhat. I have a dry, itchy scalp and spraying this on it per the directions helps to make it feel a bit less itchy and alleviates to a small extent the dryness/flaking. I do have to wash my hair daily when using this, especially in warm and/or humid weather. It can make my part look greasy and feels just kind of sticky on my scalp. The scent is a very subtle fruity one and the product is easy to brush through, and doesn’t make hair the rest of my hair look greasy.

Update: The “soothing” effect after using for about two weeks become less noticeable. I would still feel itchy around the edges of my hairline, and my part would look waxy day of, oily by the next morning. Discontinued use.",Detoxifying + Pomegranate & Ginger Scalp Toner
2020-08,5.0,"I tried this after carefully studying the reviews. I have tried Kenra and the GVP duplicate from Sally’s. Although these latter ones have done magical in straightening my hair, they both cause hair shedding. This product does what it claims. It is watery but it absorbs fast and creates silky and detangled strands. I apply this on wet and dry hair, then I apply heat. My hair is to my waist and it is unruly and can get tangled easily. This has been a cure. ",Protecting + Silk Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray
2018-08,1.0,"I bought this looking for an alternative to Kenra Platinum Blow Dry Spray, which is pretty dang pricey.  I wasn't expecting this to be the same quality, but I thought it might be good enough to work as an alternative for most days.  Not only is it not good enough, I threw it away.

It's kind of thick, and it left my hair sticky and very dry looking.  There was no shine, like I get with the Kenra.  Kenra leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy, and this does exactly the opposite. My brush dragged through my hair, rather than brushing through smoothly as I blow-dried.    I also did not get any quick drying effect from it. It made my hair wet and sticky, and it took longer to dry.  It did have quite a bit of hold to it, so I will give it that.  But overall, this was really a complete fail for me.  And it's not like it was dirt cheap.  I think I paid $10 for it.That would be reasonable-if it was a decent product.   This was first purchase of an OGX product, and it doesn't make me want to try any others.  ",Protecting + Silk Blowout Quick Drying Thermal Spray
2018-08,5.0,"I got this at the superstore while buying my hair oil that I always use from the same brand... I noticed it says on the package that it helps the hair dry faster when I blow dry it and thia sounds exciting to me as I have thick hair and takes a while to dry after washing which makes me have to wait 4-6 hours after washing it before I'm able to blow dry it. 
I tried it twice so far and love it. I makes my hair look shiny and easy to straighten ... 

It also smells good. I highly recommend it and would definately keep using it. I also got the curly one and can't wait to try it out.

2020-08,2.0,"This was a little better than the shampoo, but not by much. The shampoo left my long, thick hair feeling really dry and tangled. This had a lot of slip in the shower and at first I thought I'd like it, but it simply did not make up for how harsh the shampoo is and made my hair feel really flat when it dried. Not a huge fan of the smell either.

Pros:
-Good slip
-Affordable

Cons:
-Don't like the smell
-Really thin, so I had to use a lot
-Left hair flat
-Not conditioning enough",Orchid Oil Conditioner

2019-08,5.0,I apply this after every shower while my skin is still damp. It's helped to moisturize my dry skin so much. It doesn't break me out or make me feel sticky. You get so much lotion for the price. It smells like coconut milk with a bit of warmth from the vanilla. I find it to be really nice for layering with lots of different perfumes as well to give them a creamy note. ,Ultra Moisture Coconut Miracle Oil Lotion
2019-08,4.0,"I have SUPER DRY CRACKLY skin.  I have a hard time finding lotions without mineral oil or petrolatum and all the parabens and phthalates in them.  This one has some ingredients that I don't love.  For the most part, I like this lotion.  I love the fragrance, very tropical.  It starts out very moisturizing.  Unfortunately, it really does not last long. My skin feels crunchy mid-morning.  I don't have time to strip down and apply lotion every time I feel this way...  I do think it is a good moisturizer, but not for people who have extremely dry skin.  ",Ultra Moisture Coconut Miracle Oil Lotion

2017-08,4.0,"I adore this yummy smelling, super slick and moisturizing lotion. I usually have to use a lotion then an oil, but this actually keeps my skin dewy and hydrated for hours and hours",Ultra Moisture Coconut Miracle Oil Lotion
2019-08,3.0,"I said I wouldn't buy it again, but that's mostly because of my tendency to not repurchase anything unless it becomes a HG product. I'm also looking more for UV and heat protection now that I'm actually starting to heat style my hair sometimes again. (I haven't really even used a hair dryer very often for like 10 years, so I was mostly using this on my hair as it air dried until about a month ago.)

I haven't really looked into the ingredients to see if this actually does anything more than put a bandaid on the issue of dryness and the like, but I definitely notice a difference in my hair when I use this versus when I don't, and I do like it for the most part. Is it really doing anything for my hair beyond making it look better? Maybe not. My guess is the silicone makes my hair look nicer at the time, but that could be it. However, I think that this has helped prevent breakage because my hair tangles way less when I use it (again, probably because of the silicones making my hair smoother). So, I think it helps my hair a bit, but I really haven't done enough research into silicone-containing products to form an opinion beyond that. I think more research, in general, is needed.

I have very fine, totally straight hair, but I also have a lot of hair and I usually keep it kind of long, to around mid-back (give or take a couple of inches). My hair gets dry very easily and can start to break, and it just looks awful, so I try to almost exclusively use moisturizing products. The problem with that is how heavy some of those products can be, which isn't great when you have hair that refuses to hold volume. But this stuff? As long as I don't go overboard, it doesn't weigh my hair down, and I notice an immediate improvement in the way my hair looks and feels.


I absolutely love the scent of this stuff, and I think even my husband has commented on how pleasant it is. It's not quite the same coconut-y scent you find in some tanning products and the like, but it's also not quite real coconut or coconut oil. It's kind of in between, a little sweeter than real coconut, but not overpowering. I've also only ever used this on color treated hair, and I've never noticed any problems with my color fading faster, whether it was permanent dyes or something like Manic Panic.

Pros:
-Smells nice and not too strong
-Makes my hair look and feel smoother
-Fewer tangles/easier time brushing my hair
-Adds a little shine
-Doesn't feel heavy/weigh my hair down (although it might with curls, but it's hard to tell because my hair doesn't easily hold a curl anyway)
-Doesn't feel greasy or weird
-Hasn't faded my dyed hair
-Doesn't seem to build up in my hair/washes out easily

Cons:
-I think this might sometimes cause me to break out where my hair touches my face while I sleep",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum

2018-08,5.0,"If you like coconut fragrances you will LOVE this. Aside from TBS coconut shower cream and lotion, this is the closest I've ever got to a true, strong coconut fragrance. As for performance? My dislike of silicones aside, it does a brilliant job at making my hair softer, more manageable and less frizzy...to the point where I can overlook the ingredients aspect of it. 
I just use half a pump of this, no more and I'm good to go. Zero weighing down or oiliness. Just tangle-free hair that I can brush through without breakage. 

To avoid greasy roots I would strongly suggest to leave at least 1-2 inches above scalp when you apply to your hair. Some of it will naturally travel down due to gravity any way, so keep that in mind. Only slight dislike is the pump as it's not ideal for travel...end up putting into a sealable bag as it can quite easily dispense when jostled around in suitcase. The pump is also prone to breaking if dropped (as I have done!) but again no biggie for me, the product works well enough for me to overlook packaging flaws. At worst I can just empty into another bottle with a pump that I can pick up from most cosmetic stores for a couple of bucks.

After spending $400 on Boheyme hair extensions and discovering that the quality had now become so bad, (could barely brush my hair, was matted and tangled everyday, knots) I tried many products. I tried three $50 hair serums/ oils and none made a big difference. I found a 3 year old bottle of this laying around and gave it a try. I am honestly amazed, I can actually brush my hair now, it’s smooth and soft and I can put many layers on without it weighing down my hair.

I don't notice the smell anymore, but my hairdresser always comments on how good it smells when she is cutting my hair.  The only thing I don't like about this product is the bottle which has no lid - every time it gets dropped on our bathroom floor the cap breaks and the pump is then useless.  I always keep an empty bottle to decant the serum into in case of breakage, but a plastic cap would fix this issue.

Like a real coconut oil smell, not a weird perfume-y overly sweet fake coconut tanning oil smell. I only put a little bit in my hair after washing because I typically have trouble with oils weighing down my fine curly hair. It felt great and smoothed my curls. I just went to lather up my 3 day old hair in this stuff to do a little deep conditioning, and put about 3-4 pumps(a lot) in my hand and started to run it through my hair. I have hair above my shoulders and after a second of trying to coat all of my hair it didn't even look like I put oil in my hair! I don't know if that's a sign of how dry my hair is or what but this is NOT the heavy serum like many of these reviews are saying. I would say it's medium-lightly greasy in comparison to ones I've used in the past. I didn't even feel the need to wash my hands afterward. As for anti-breakage claim? I'm not sure, everyone's hair is so different. Only complaint, it didn't come with a lid, and you aren't able to twist to close?

My ends are still soft, but they look dull. The formula is also super thick, so it might be better suited for people with really dry hair (mine is normal).

2015-08,5.0,Ok if you read my other reviews you will see that my husband and I went to Harmon Face Values over the weekend. He purchased the large Organix coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and the coconut milk spray . I love this serum. I only used it a few times but here is why I like it. It smells good. It is not sticky. I have tried other anti breakage serums and they can be sticky like a lip gloss or have an odd chemical smell. This smell great and is great to use as instructed on towel dry hair or even on dry hair . I will say this a little goes a long way. I have long thick wavy hair and I only use a dime sized amount for all of my hair. I think it works well with other Organix products and Harmon has the best price for it only $5.99 is the everyday low price for 4 oz. it adds shine and is great to use in those in between days when you have not washed your hair in a day or so . I also love the packaging it is great so only a small amount can be dispensed at a time which is great when you are using a serum with oil . I used it last night in my dry hair and brushed my hair with a paddle brush. I really love it. I would definitely give it a try.,Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2015-08,2.0," This serum is very thick, heavy and gummy and sticky feeling. Like putting castor oil in the hair. I'm sort of impressed because it is hard for me to actually find products that are &quot;enough&quot; for my hair and this serum was way too much for me. I have very thick, very long, straight hair.

I tried many ways to using this. First I tried just the ends and it left my hair feeling like a ball and chain it was so heavy, oily, and stuck together. Mind you I did only use a little bit. I did the mistake of applying it mid shaft and down and my hair was so gross afterwards! Sticky, heavy, weighed down and greasy. I once tried this as a pre shampoo treatment, just to get rid of it. Huge mistake. It took three washes with shampoo and I eventually resorted to dish washing soap to get it all out.

2015-08,4.0,"I read a few reviews and thought I might add that you should use this on your hair just after you have washed it, while it is still wet!

One day about a year ago, after the shower, I tried it because I have extremely long hair and sometimes brushing it is just not fun! And wow,  now I just LOVE it!! So, so much.. I have tried much higher end stuff and yes those are nice too but this is so wonderful for the price and smells so nice. I can brush my hair, it doesn't add grease and grime, it just dries wonderfully soft and silky and unknotted! All day! So... if you have this and just disregard it, try it on wet hair, and concentrate on dry/damaged areas (not your roots) I don't think you'll be disappointed!

So while I can't say that this works for my hair, it does make a great, divine-smelling moisturizer for dry hands and that's' what I've been using it for. I'm glad it's not going to waste!

So here I am a year later(April) still heat straightening my 3b curls (only dyeing my roots to cover the grays) and even with trims I have noticed my hair just breaks and won't get any longer. I immediately stopped straightening,got a good trim and started embracing my 3b curls.....and introducing my hair to this serum and OMG am I glad I did!!!!!!!!!!! I started using this in April and here we are in June,,,I can totally see a difference with my hair bigtime. The scent is just insanely yummy and this feels so lightweight on my hair,zero greasiness..obviously I apply to my ends and work up halfway of my hair length.....breakage is pretty much all gone and my curls look sooooo much better while using this...1 pump is all I need!!!! Simply Amazing stuff!!!

100% repurchase over &amp; over!!!!!!",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2014-08,4.0,"This serum is great for the price! I haven't been using this product for a couple months since I switched to an Argan Oil hair treatment, but this SMELLS AMAZING! I just run it through my ends with damp hair and blowdry or airdry. It's not as expensive as some other hair treatments and a little really does go a long way. However, I don't think I'll be repurchasing this after I'm finished because I prefer the argan oil one I have (which is a lot more expensive, mind you)",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2014-08,5.0,"I am absolutely in love with this!
The smell, the price, the consistency and the results.
In the U.S. this retails for around $5-$8 depending on the store and sales going on.
I picked this up because I have had pretty good experiences with the Organix line before. 
I was previously using Joico kpak styling oil and noticed is was making me breakout all around my scalp/hairline/cheeks/neck anywhere my hair touched.
The ingredients in this seem simple and it is effective.
I apply two pumps to damp hair and let it air dry. Can also be used on dry hair working through the ends.
A great deal on a product that will make your hair smooth and silky and also smell delicious.. hopefully not pica inducing.",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2014-08,5.0,love this stuff! made my hair so soft and shiny after just a few uses.  Smells awesome! My hair is super long &amp; fine and i have been dying my hair since i was 14. My hair is very long (almost to my boo-tay) and i only need to use 1 pump.  Using too much will make you greasy! ,Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2014-08,5.0,"I love this product ! Before this product I had bought the morrocan oil treatment and the its a 10 miracle leave in products which were really expensive and they suck compared to this ! This oil makes your hair supppper soft and shiney. I love my hair after putting this on, but the only negative side would be that It doest make your hair greasy if you put too much ! Execpt for that it is great ! ",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2014-08,5.0,"I am in love with this serum! After countess dyes, bleaching, and heat torture sessions my hair was on the verge of death. It would fall and the breakage was so noticeable with all the visible fly always and broken hairs all over my bathroom floor. Don't even get me started in the straw like dryness and the frizz! It was awful. My hair wouldn't hold any style it was so pathetic. Luckily, during a visit to my local target I came across this little number. When I read the description I couldn't believe it. So I sampled it... I know it's bad but I had to see for myself. I tested it on a problematic area in my hair and oh boy was I amazed! The hair soaked it up like a parched person in the Sahara Desert! The smell was divine! There was absolutely no left over residue or greasiness. My hair looked so shiny and transformed. It actually made its way back to my natural wave. After I purchased I've used it everyday since. It makes brushing so much more easier! I don't feel my hair breaking after I apply this product. It's a good protectant against heat as well. I used it on dry hair, damp, and to tame flyaways throughout the day. I would recommend this product to anyway in a hair crisis! It's fantastic ",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2013-08,3.0,"I thought this serum was just OK. It was no miracle worker on my hair, but it didn't have particularly negative effects on it. I have frizzy hair that's oily at the roots but very dry, brittle ends, and typically use Tresemme Nourishing Rituals Cashmere Touch Hydrating Serum on my ends after washing my hair, or Biosilk Silk Therapy which is on the pricier side. I tried this Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum when I ran out of both after reading lots of glowing reviews on it, but I feel like I had to dispense more product from this bottle than I did from the Tresemme serum to get similar results. I had a similar issue with the Organix Renewing  Moroccan Argan Oil Penetrating Oil I tried a long time ago, which I also had to use a ridiculous amount to feel like it had any effect. My hair is not very long--just past the shoulders--and it's not very thick. The Coconut Milk serum didn't weigh my hair down at all even after applying as much as I did, so I take it it absorbed well into damp hair, but I don't feel at all that a little goes a long way with this. And I guess now I can admit that I personally don't seem to like the smell of coconut in general, and of course this smells strongly of it.

Will be switching back to my Tresemme serums, which feel just as lightweight, absorbent, and hydrating using far less product than this Organix serum. Organix just isn't impressing me.",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2013-08,5.0,"I bought this after reading a lot of good reviews on it. I have used Moroccan Oil Light and The Oil from AG. Both of them didn't seem to properly absorb into my fine hair. Now I may have fine hair but I do have a lot of it. So after reading reviews on this, since being on the hunt for a new serum, I went out and got it. I found it at our local Superstore, it was like $10 I think. Normally I wouldn't be too keen on using a non salon product, but I decided to try it. 

All I can say about the results are, AMAZING. My hair feels hydrated, and less crunchy (I flat iron my hair everyday and it is also colored every 8 weeks or so). My hair also finally looks shiny, and healthy, and it is soooo soft! In fact I just got a compliment on how great my hair looks like an hour ago! I never have gotten compliments on my hair before! It absorbed really easily into my ends and mid shaft (that's where my hair is the driest) and I didn't notice any stickiness. I let my hair air dry and it just feels incredible. The smell of it is also fantastic, but if you don't like coconuts then I wouldn't recommend this product, it has quite a strong coconut smell. But the scent doesn't linger which is nice, so if you can put up with the scent for a little while, BEST SERUM EVER. 
I also really like the packaging for it, love how you can lock the pump, so its convenient for travel. I haven't noticed any leakage or anything so far, but that might just be because it stays on my bathroom counter. The price was also fantastic! I am so not made out of money so i'm really happy to have found something that works, and is reasonably priced!
I will definitely be buying this again once I run out!

Overall, excellent product, really made a difference in the appearance, feel, and overall health of my hair! Definitely recommended!",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2013-08,4.0,"I use this any time I decide to go blonde and will be facing straw-like hair as a result. The product smooths and hydrates the hair and tames frizzies, and it smells delicious. 

A little goes a very long way.  First warm it by rubbing between your hands and then apply it to the bottom half of wet hair. 

If you're worried about the product being too heavy for you, there's a lighter version in a spritzer bottle as well. 

Hope this helps! :)",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum

I had mixed feelings when i put it into my towel dried hair but it really made a difference! my hair useto feel really dry and gross but this has helped to make it softer and more alive.
i would definitely look into this if you're hair is dry!

Oh my goodness, I love the way this stuff smells.

2013-08,4.0,"I really like this product.  I have very fine dirty blonde hair with blonde highlights and this serum makes my hair look very healthy without weighing it down.  After shampooing (just shampoo with no conditioner) I add a small amount of this serum to my hair, more on the ends, and blow dry.  It leaves my hair very soft and frizz free all day.  It also smells amazing of pure coconut and is very clean feeling, not sticky and leaves no heavy residue.

2013-08,5.0,"I love, love, LOVE this stuff! It really is like hair crack to me. Now I am in my third year of college and I have been dying my hair since the 3rd grade, I am not even joking, so my hair has had some rough time. Grant it I didn't dye it all the time, but straightening it a lot sure didn't help my hair. However, I stopped dying my hair last year and have been attempting to grow out my natural hair and it has been a slow and steady process. I actually don't really have much split end, but my tip area little on the dry side which does not look cute when I let my hair air dry. So in an attempt to rebuild my hair I bought this serum. AND it truly does work, my hairs feel sooooo smooth and soft now, I love touching it after it air dries and my tips no longer look dry or frizzy its great! I usually just use one pump for my whole hair and it seems to be working just fine, it doesn't make my hair oily, its not heavy and it smells amazing too. I honestly feel it has helped my hair growth and I could not be happier.

I do warn though, I have been using their keratin shampoo and conditioner so it is kind of like a triple threat and that may have some influence. Either way, LOVE this stuff. ",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum

This stuff made my hair so shiny and soft and I was even able to blow-dry it out.  I NEVER am able to do that because my hair frizzes.  This stuff is unreal.  One note, using less is more lol.

I am on a mission to find that one product that will put the moisture back into my hair so I decided to try this out. This product definitely made my hair look better: it felt silky and less ""begging for mercy"" parched as it usually does. Unfortunately, the irony of it is that it really is not meant for fine hair. The only way I can describe its consistency is as if you put glue on your hair, causing the oils (and whatever else is in there) to sit on top of the hair follicle instead of being absorbed by it, sometimes causing clumping. I tried using a smaller amount and distributing it more sparsely but my hair still ended up looking greasy and weighed down within a couple of hours. It really is a shame.

I used to have very dry, brittle hair and thanks to this serum my hair is incredibly soft and shiny, it also protects my hair from heat styling. This serum smells so delicious. I will definitely be repurchasing this again! ",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2013-08,1.0,"Not impressed at all. I put this in my towel-dried hair and it still was just as frizzy when it dried without anything in it. It's going back to CVS. Gotta remember to buy real coconut oil--that stuff really works, plus I can cook with it.",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2013-08,1.0,"It was soo oily and sticky in my hair and it did nothing at all. It comes in a spray though, and that works amazingly. The oil is terrible, but the spray is great.",Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Serum
2019-08,4.0,"Packaging : Transparent bottle presents with a splash of coconut water which illustrates well of what is the contain of this hair oil. It comes with spray nozzle which sadly, it does not function that well as I need to press hard (like the nozzle gets stuck somewhere and it does not spray evenly like fine mist)  to spray out the hair oil onto my palm - a coin size of oil, not fine mist. 
Price : Quite pricey but I do not mind buying because I really cannot resist myself from OGX hair products especially hair oil/serum. I bought it online (qoo10) quite sometime ago which again, sadly, the seller, USA Seller no longer exists. 
Oil Texture : Hey! Do not freak out just because it is oil! OGX claims that it is weighless which is very true and once I spray out the oil onto my palm and start to warm it by rubbing my palms together, it dries up very quickly! So no fear that it might overweight your hair to make it looks like oil slick. It is something very light and hydrating enough. You do not have to worry of over using it if you have hair texture like me - dry, straw and frizzy hair.
Scent : Lovely coconut scent - it smell so sweet with warm coconut scent. Anyone who likes coconut by-products will surely falls for this hair oil! It is not overpowering if you are wearing perfume on your body/clothes but just itself alone, can work out well like a hair perfume!
Verdict : An overall good performed hair oil with coconut oil, coconut water and electrolytes which in my opinion, it can use alone by itself if you do not use with its matching shampoo and conditioner. I personally need 5 - 6 sprays of oil for my middle length hair which is very dry and untamed. The oil dries up very fast and it means all the coconut goodness can soak up perfectly into the hair cuticles, rather than just sitting on it. Electrolytes is a key ingredient which 'recharge' and hydrate your hair but this oil is not strong enough to prove sufficient moisture and hydration to my hair.  It does create a bit of healthy shine (but my hair is still dry, with frizz and tangles abit) on my hair although nothing too amazing as I fantasize so much of hair product commercial kinda mirror shiny hair. This hair oil might not be a hit for someone who really needs moisturizing hair oil for very dry hair because I myself mix using this hair oil with my other types of hair oi (The Body Shop Olive Nourishing Dry Oil, Sephora All-in-One Nourishing Oil followed by this OGX Coconut Water Weighless Hydration Oil and a bit of mineral oil to block the moisture from humid weather to enter into my hair cuticles and reactivate the crazy frizziness. If you are a huge OGX fans like me, you may give this product a try.",Coconut Water Weighless Hydration Oil
2019-08,4.0,"Packaging : In a typical OGX plump transparent plastic bottle. No leakage from its flip flop bottle and the bottle is made of a tough plastic material - no dented when fall on floor. Clean and simple packaging with nothing gimmick or flowery.
Price : Quite expensive but worth buying or giving it a try when there is a sale.
Conditioner Texture : Average thick creamy texture.It does not flow out from its bottle (which is something good as I hate runny conditioner as it gives me an impression that it is not moist enough for my dry and frizzy hair). It is easy to spread through my hair (middle length downwards to hair end) and not too rich and thick that sometimes it is a bit too 'slippery' that it might fall onto the floor before it gets spreaded evenly on your hair. Be precise of your quantity and not to over squeeze extra as this is an average conditioner - not too thick but not too watery which I do not need to use that much for my middle length hair.
Scent : Lovely sweet coconut scent (something sweeter than its matching shampoo) with a hint of tropical fruit punch and buttery vanilla scent. A great scent of conditioner that makes you feel like you are on a tropical island/beach during your summer holiday. No joke. It smells that great and you definitely enjoy you bathing time with this lovely bottle in your bathroom. Nothing too overpowering which makes you feel uncomfortable. The scent lingers on my hair the next day despite the 'attack' of different horrible smells - from motorcycles and other vehicles, polluted air and eateries.
Verdict : After using its matching shampoo, I pair it with this conditioner. It is a bit hard to squeeze out from the bottle due to its creamy texture. It works out well to detangle my hair and I let it sits on my hair for about 10-15 minutes before I rinse it off with warm water followed by cold water to seal the hair follicles/cuticles. It smells so great but hydrating level is not on the top (although not ultra hydrating as OGX stresses that this conditioner is ultra lightweight even though it is made of coconut oil, coconut water and electrolytes) as my hair still gets frizzy after drying and flat ironing. I would recommend this product to those who have fine, limp hair and need a bit of hydration which is not too rich and creamy as it might overweight their hair. Worth giving it a try if you have not and especially if you like product that smells so yummilicious like OGX!",Coconut Water Conditioner
2019-08,4.0,"Packaging: A transparent plump bottle, just a typical OGX shampoo packaging with a flip flop cap. Cap closes tight and no leakage. The plastic material is quite tough not those cheap fragile plastic that can easily get dented if falls on the floor. Not very eye-catching compared to other OGX ranges because of its transparent bottle.
Price : Quite pricey as compared to other brands. But worth buying if it is on sale.
Shampoo Texture : Transparent liquid with a runny texture. Be careful of pouring out the shampoo and you might get too much of the quantity that you need.
Scent : A sweet lovely tropical coconut smell with a hint of buttery vanilla touch. Nothing too overpowering that will give you a headache. It makes you enjoy your shampooing time with this product. Just like other OGX hair products, it smells delicious enough to eat and no doubt, close your eyes, you can imagine you are on a beach with ample sunshine and a touch of sea breeze, enjoying a coconut drink to quench your thirst, ie. time for your dry and stressed tress to get some nourishment from the goodness of coconut!
Verdict : I bought this product quite some time ago. I dug it out again to use it before it gets expired which was such a waste. I love OGX products despite they are quite expensive. But having a few bottles of OGX shampoos and conditioners are just too 'mentally comforting&quot; especially for me, who is a product junk and I just can't say NO to OGX products! The shampoo is made with the main ingredients of coconut water, coconut oil and electrolytes which work out as a good combination to nourish dry straw hair to silky smooth and tamed tress. They are good ingredients to 'recharge' your hair which might be dry like straw and an extra touch to keep it presentable and easy to comb through - and most importantly to make it smell nice! Unfortunately, this is not really what happened to me as OGX stresses that it is ultra lightweight hydrating. In other words, the shampoo is a bit weak to overcome my dry frizzy hair problem even though I use it in combination with its matching conditioner and hydration oil hair spray. The shampoo itself works well as it creates so much foam and thoroughly cleanse my hair (with a lot hair products - 3 or 4 types of oil and/or serums to tame my dry frizzy hair, so you can imagine how dry and unruly my hair is). Nothing too overburdening of this shampoo as OGX precisely describes that this shampoo is ultra lightweight. Perhaps those who have fine, limp and tame hair but needs a bit of nourishment and hydration, can give this product a try. ",OGX Coconut Water Shampoo
2019-08,5.0,"One of my favorite OGX conditioners. Whenever I use this, my oily scalp and roots seem to be more balanced over the following days. There's no heaviness or weighing down, if anything it makes my hair feel 'clean' and refreshed. My hair looks shinier, tangles are much less, frizz is to a degree reduced and this is despite me only using it for 3 minutes - which for some reason is the magic number for me. There's quite a few reviews online where people are not getting good results with this and for them my tip would be (if they still have the bottle) to use it for a shorter amount of time and see whether that works better as I think for some the whole 'oxygenating effect' is too much if left on long. Not noticing the promised 'volumizing' effect but that may be because my hair type is not the fine hair that this conditioner is targeted at. I have thick hair with oily roots and struggle to find a conditioner that doesn't leave me more oily. Will definitely re-purchase.

On my thick, oily hair it cleans very thoroughly, almost squeaky-clean yet without stripping my hair. The downside to that is the tangles...I end up having to use a ton of conditioner to rectify it. On the plus side it smells amazing, like I've had a good salon treatment, and my hair actually feels hydrated and has more bounce to it. Volume I'm not so sure about as I haven't noticed any difference in that department, but overall I'm happy. For me this is not quite as effective as the 'Charcoal Detox' shampoo and conditioner but so far it's a close second.

2017-08,4.0,"My husband, who has shoulder length hair, and I both like this.  Our hair is color treated and wavy; it's difficult to comb out because it tangles easily.  Mine is very fine and his is very thick.  The formula, while this isn't clear from the packaging and description, is for people who need both moisture and volume.  I have traditionally found most volumizing products to be very drying, which this isn't.  It smells wonderful, and isn't overly floral like some of the other OGX products (he is EXTREMELY particular about scents, especially with hair products because so many are coconut.)

My only complaint, and I have this issue with most OGX products, is that when they get low it is difficult to get the last of the product out of the bottom because the bottles are pretty rigid and the lids and shoulders of the bottles are rounded so you can't do the &quot;stand it on its top&quot; trick unless you have something to lean it on.  On the upside, they have actually made the shampoo and conditioner different from each other in this line (the shampoo is in a transparent bottle and the conditioner is opaque) so unlike some of the others, I can easily tell them apart in the shower when I don't have my glasses on.",O2 Shampoo

This shampoo is perfect for people with fine hair that need very little moisturisation and that is easily weighed down.

2019-08,4.0,"This is the conditioner that lead me to the shampoo (and not the other way round!). I leave it on for about 5 minutes, sometimes even applying a tiny amount as a leave-in conditioner, and then rinse. I love the fact that it has a ton of Vitamin E in it and leaves my hair smelling lovely for the rest of the day (a fruity fragrance). Keeps my thick hair looking shiny, more manageable and less knotted, without making the roots oily. I didn't find the shampoo to be as good as the conditioner and will definitely try pairing it with some of the other newer OGX shampoos and see how it works with them. Vitamin E is a great antioxidant to protect hair and it's good to know I'm actually doing something worthwhile for my hair when using this. There's not many conditioners I can say that about!

2019-08,4.0,"Another week and another round of OGX goodies to try out. First in line was the Vitamin E Shampoo. I actually started out with the conditioner, loved it and went back to the store for the matching shampoo. It's very gentle and helps tame the perpetual friziness that's the bane of my life! Rinses out easily, lathers well but leaves my hair not quite as squeaky clean as I'd like it to, and over the next 2 days after washing it does get slightly oily. Probably best suited to drier and finer hair types, mine is more on the oily and coarse side. One thing I must mention is the smell, it's an amber-pepper fragrance that I'm still not too sure whether I like or not. It's unusual for sure! Not a bad shampoo by any means but also not quite what I was expecting it to be. The only reason I've given it 4 lippies instead of 3 is because it contains a VERY generous amount of Vitamin E in it - higher up on the ingredients list than any other shampoo I've seen before. Although I'm not convinced Vit E is any better for conditioning hair than say Panthenol (Vit B5), it's still an excellent antioxidant and the perfect antidote for free radicals - which if you live in an urban or high UV environment like I do, you'll likely be exposed to on a daily basis. This is the kind of shampoo that works long after you've rinsed it out, and for that reason it's a keeper!

2019-08,1.0,"I don't get the good reviews. After using it I had to check the label to make sure it was a conditioner at all, cause it feels like applying shampoo on your hair, even lighter than most shampoos actually. Doesn't moisturize, smooth or detangle. My hair was a mess of knots. It's not even cheap, damn it. And the packaging is awful, looks pretty but it's a pain to get the product out.",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner
2017-08,4.0,"I enjoy the scent of this line. It smells like cocoa butter. 
This conditioner is a really thick formula.
Rinsing this out my hair felt moisturized but not silky like with other thick formulas.
It did condition well and detangle my hair. 
Together this shampoo and conditioner did help my frizzy hair much more than other smoothing formulas ever have. I also noticed a lot less hair fall out in my shower and my hair looked healthier with continued use.
Will I purchase again?
I am not too sure, if I do it will only be the large bottles and only if I can find them on sale. 
I felt the shape of the bottle really made it hard to squeeze out the very thick formula.

2017-08,3.0,I liked this better than the shampoo but still nothing special.  Conditioner felt moisturizing and smooth but after my hair dried it made no difference. I dislike these containers....hard to get all the product out,Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner
2017-08,5.0,"I am super impressed and a bit amazed by this conditioner! My hair is fine, a bit damaged from constant color changes, and wavy/frizzy if I let it airdry but easily straightened with a blowout/iron. 

My HG conditioner of all time used to be the old (pre 2013) Redken All Soft with avocado oil (cannot use the newer formula with argan, very drying). I have been on a mission for years to find a replacement and decided to try this because it contains avocado oil and it had some solid reviews online. I never buy drugstore products but was intrigued, especially for the price.

I have to say, this is seriously a very close 2nd place to the old Redken All Soft. In fact, the closest thing I have found in years and I buy/try/return a LOT of hair products. It's one of those conditioners that as soon as you put it in your hair, you can instantly run your fingers through effortlessly - and the smell is delicious!! 

Afterwards, my hair is SUPER shiny, doesn't feel coated, looks very healthy/manageable and doesn't frizz when airdried. I use this with the Enjoy Luxury Shampoo (sulfate-free and gentle). Afterwards I use the AG Hair Moisture Conditioning Mist Detangling Spray + 1 pump of Redken Heat Glide mixed with 1 pump of Paul Mitchell Skinny Serum and blow out with a Sportnette Italian Round Boar bristle brush. 

Will definitely try more products from company soon! ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner
2016-08,2.0,"I have very dry frizz-prone damaged looking hair. It is also quite thin. So I was looking for a product that would help condition my hair and help cope with bad hair days. Unfortunately, this only seemed to work for me in the initial few applications after which it did nothing for my hair. It smells good, but that's not what conditioners are meant for. Left my hair feeling rather dry and dull. Could be just the way my hair is and might need more work. Overall, would not re purchase once I'm through with my current supply. Rather disappointing!

2015-08,4.0,This has always been one of my favorite drugstore conditioners. Works well to moisturize my hair and leave it smooth and soft. Smells very good too! Can't beat the price and this is my go-to at CVS when I'm on a budget. ,Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner
2015-08,5.0,"LOVE this! The shampoo is ridiculously thick - you only need the tiniest bit and mix it with water.  My scalp is oily and prone to itchy, painful bumps which have totally gone since I have been using this shampoo and conditioner (alternating with the Anti-Breakage Keratin Oil products from OGX as well).  My hair is damaged, baby fine and very porous.  Normally I need at least twice as much conditioner as I do shampoo.  Not the case with this stuff.  If you can imagine it's more like a body butter than a body lotion, you're getting the idea of how thick and creamy it is.  I really didn't think this was going to be great with my hair.  Meanwhile, I use about half a teaspoon of the conditioner and it is more than enough to massage through from my ears down to the tips.  (I never do my roots)  Because it's so thick, it stays on your hands, which gives more control of application.  I'm not crazy about the smell - it's sweet and nutty - almost chocolatey.  I'm sure lots of people would love that, though.  The end result is hair that is surprisingly full, soft and silky.  I'm hooked. ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner
2015-08,5.0,"I actually love this conditioner as it always leaves my hair feeling softer, moisturized, and more manageable. It is very thick due to the silicone content and cocoa butter. My hair LOVES silicone. Additionally, this actually has more keratin than a lot of the higher end brands I've bought from. My hair feels healthy after using this, although I do not believe it permanently undoes damage because it doesn't repair broken bonds in hair (only olaplex can do that). But nevertheless, on a regular basis, this conditioner is in my top 5 for conditioning masques. 

My ONLY gripe is that fragrance is so high up in the ingredient list: Deionized Water, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth 20, Parfum, Hydrolyzed Keratin Protein, Theobroma Cacao Extract (Cocoa Butter), Cocos Nucifera Oil (Coconut), Persea Gratissima Oil (Avocado), Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Extract (Aloe Leaf), Panthenol, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Blue 1 Lake (CI 42090), Red 40, Yellow 5

It has been highlighted and lowlighted for the past 6 years, whenever I get bored so I need moisture for my hair. 

The first time I used this product it did not do anything regarding straightening abilities, and did not smooth it out. I used it a few more times and alternated conditioners and this one left the least amount of moisture. 

None, if anything. I know it is sulfate-free, but I use Aveda leave in which is also sulfate free and it does an amazing job leaving my hair smooth. I was looking for an alternative leave in as the aformentioned one costs 120$/500ml. 

I decided to write a review because yesterday after I used the Organix product it left my hair knotty, unmanagable, rough, and I used 3 pumps of moroccan oil and it still felt rough. My hair was clumping, and I was scared to wash it today. 

Despite that, I used an old bottle of l'oreal  mask which I know has a lot of sulfates and it feels amazing at this moment. 

This conditioner smells amazing, but does nothing for moisture or straightening my hair. I would get the same result if I did not use the conditioner.

I give it a 4/5 because my hair is not soft after using this conditioner and also because alcohol is listed as an ingredient.

2013-08,5.0,"I have been through every hair product on the market over the years and came across this one day in CVS.  I had a coupon and figured why not.  My hair is fairly long and naturally curly/wavy and prone to frizz.  Nothing really works on it except John Frieda's line.
I didn't have many high hopes for this but it only cost me 99 cents with the coupon.  First time I used it my hair was very sleek and tame.  It was very noticeable.  It was easy to style and handle but not straight.  Not sure why it says straight because it did not make it straight, it simply relaxed it a bit.
I am giving it 5 stars because it seriously knocked me off my feet how good my hair is now.  I switched back to my Redken the other day and it made it frizzy.  I wanted to check how much this Organix was working and kept switching back and forth.  Every time I went to the other brands it became frizzy or harder to manage.

This stuff is good if you straighten every time you wash, but if you let your hair air dry, you might find it tough to get a comb through. The results are just very inconsistent, I took this stuff on vacation to an air with hard water and it reacted very badly. I literally could not brush my hair. I suspect the conditioner works best with the entire line of products from this group, plus careful heat styling, but on days I don't feel like heat styling I shouldn't be left with near-dredlocks.

Usually I use Tigi Dumb Blonde Reconstructor.  It's definitely not the same but after a few uses I decided to purchase the matching shampoo, too. The conditioner has an odd texture because of the glycerin in it. I also end up using a dab of Suave after I rinse the Organix out because it doesn't detangle my naturally curly hair as much as I prefer.  What I like is that some of my curl pattern is returning and it's better than using nothing.  What I don't like is that I *must* use mousse or gel when air drying or else I get a frizzy mess, something that doesn't happen with Tigi. Still, it smells good and since I can buy both shampoo and conditioner for less than what I'd pay for the Dumb Blonde alone I'll stick with this until I finish the bottle. BTW, the bottle is ridiculously hard to deal with after a few uses. I'll have to remove the top in order to get the rest of the conditioner out.",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner
2012-08,3.0,"I gave this product overall rating of only 3, I would still recommend it BUT...


First of all, I don't like packaging of it. After first use, it is very hard to get product out of the bottle. It looks cute, but it's very unpractical for getting
the conditioner out. It annoys me to shake and try to squeeze bottle in the shower for 3 minutes to get it out, and I only used just about quarter of the bottle. 

It is rather small bottle as well, I don't think you get many uses out of it. However, price is not that bad so if it works well for your hair, it might be worth it.

Once I got it out of the bottle, the product is really thick, great smelling and makes my hair soft. It does take some frizz away, it didn't straighten my hair (they are frizzy curls, I didn't expect it to straighten my hair) but it did help me to manage them a little bit more.

In the shower, my hair feels really soft and it's quite easy to comb through them with my fingers, which I have to do in the shower.
However, it is not moisturizing enough for me.
Once my hair dry, they are not as soft anymore. I think first and second use I got great results, after that my hair went back to what it was.


I am not sure if it's because of silicons in it (I try to use silicon-free conditioners, however I used hair masque that does contain silicons, so I am open to try most of the products).

All in all, I think this can work wonders for someone with wavy, dry (but not extra dry and damages hair).

I like shampoo of this brand more (see review) because it doesn't contain sulfates which is hard for me to find, but when it comes to conditioner I prefer something more conditioning for my hair type (really dry ends from about ears down, quite a lot of frizz).

I would recommend for someone with not as damaged and dry hair, for me, I am not sure if I would repurchase this, but I would definitely buy shampoo again!

2011-08,5.0,"I have both the shampoo and conditioner in this line and purchased them for $6 each due to mispricing of the product, but I heard from the cashier that they normally retail for $10 each. I bought this by recommendation of Michele1218 on Youtube as I was in the market for an affordable, but high quality haircare line. The reasons why  I was interested in Organix hair products are because they are (1) sulfate free (2)  paraben free (3) cruelty free and (4) pact full of good ingredients such as coconut oil, keratin protein, avocado oil, and cocoa butter. Another important note to make is the beautifully rich Brazilian nut fragrance! I am obsessed with this scent and also happen to have a body scrub by The Tree Hut that smells just like these hair products.  I feel like my hair is so well nourished by the shampoo and conditioner that I only need to use them twice a week as a treatment. I normally wash my hair 3 times a week, which means that I will use them every other wash.

When you apply it onto your hair you don't feel that soft and luxurious soft hair feeling that a higher end conditioner will give you... although the packaging is cute and the smell is breath-taking, the name is a bit misleading as it's not a fully organic product.

Instead of a conditioner I've started using it as a bathing body milk and it makes my skin smell and feel nice! I might even purchase the shampoo and use it as a body wash! ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner

This conditioner is better than Frederick Fekkai, Paul Mitchell, Bed Head, Biolage, and Biosilk, all of which I use in my hair rotation. It smells a lot like cocoa butter and the smell lingers but I love that smell so it's okay. It's the richest most luxurious conditioner I have come across and I have spent hundreds on conditioners. I truly recommend this and I will purchase until it isn't sold any longer. LOVE!",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner

Whenever I find it on sale, I stock up as the bottles are small and I run out quickly and that's why I'm only giving 4 stars overall.  The smell is very nice - almost chocolatey.

I am on the fence so far on this one. It does not seem to be as conditioning as I would have expected from the ingredients. And it was a little sticky on the first use....which was better on the 2nd use after shaking it VERY well to mix it up.  ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Conditioner
2019-08,5.0,"I've become a hair product junkie all of a sudden.  I wear my hair in a pixie and I love the piecy, tousled look.  I have tons of products.  Sprays, pomades, dry shampoos, beach sprays, you name it, I have it.  I have several OGX prods and this is one of them.  It's great.  Usually, after I dye my hair, or give it a repair treatment, it gets slippery soft and does not hold a style.  I spray this and gently mess my hair.  Voilà, I have soft, shiny, piecy hair.  I also have Redken's Wax Spray, which I like, but I think this is better because it's not so hard and it definitely gives a nice shine.   If you have fine, thin hair like mine, less is more.  But the golden rule remains the same with any kind of hair: DON'T overdo it.  ",Flexible + Beeswax Texture Hair Spray Wax
2018-08,5.0,"I've really been liking various OGX hair care products.  And this Flexible + Beeswax Texture Hair Spray Wax is great, IMO!  I have a variety of &quot;texture&quot; sprays that contain wax and I do like them (AG Dry Wax, Joico Texture Boost, Sexy Hair Play Dirty, Ion Texture Spray Wax) and they all do a fine job.

But this OGX Beeswax is just perfect and I'll be purchasing this again.  It's a wonderful finishing spray that gives hair a nice piecey look and definitely smooths fly-aways and reduces (or even eliminates) frizz.  It gives my hair body, and makes it more sleek and polished looking without appearing oily at all.

You definitely don't want to over-spray, and you do need to spray this lightly from at least 10 inches away.  Super easy and quick to use and does everything I need to maintain a nice, polished, piecey look (my hair is shoulder length - or just below shoulders) and is a bit course - can get frizzy when I blow dry it and this product just &quot;fixes&quot; everything!",Flexible + Beeswax Texture Hair Spray Wax
2019-08,3.0,"Probably my least favorite from all the OGX products I've been trying recently. Used this straight after the shampoo and left in for around 5 minutes (roughly the same amount of time as other conditioners I tried, to get a good comparison). There's no shimmer or glitter in this one and as far as drug store conditioners go it's ok but not really worth the cost, there are much better ones out there. Left my hair shinier and slightly softer, but not good for tangles in the shower and I also found my hair was becoming both frizzier and oilier whilst using this. Better suited to drier hair types. The scent lingers pretty much all day too so definitely pick this up and have a sniff as it's not the kind of fragrance that everyone will take well to (sea salt/kelp beach-y smell).

2019-08,3.0,"After trying the 'Charcoal' shampoo and conditioner early last week, I went straight onto the 'Liquid Pearl' ones - another fairly new offering from OGX. Firstly the shampoo: I liked it but it performed nowhere near as well as the Charcoal shampoo did - which I feel is much more suited to oily hair types and if you have build-up. The Liquid Pearl shampoo had a slightly unusual smell, I can't put my finger on what exactly, but is a joy visually - iridescent pink with a pearly shimmer throughout. It also lathers surprisingly well, the only place it falls slightly short is on my hair texture, whenever I use this my hair feels pretty dry, even though there's no sulfates in here, some other ingredient they've used does not work for me. I've read the same thing in other reviews online too about it drying out hair. For reference I did follow with the conditioner but still found the results to be mediocre at best. Not a bad shampoo by any means but not one that I'd be rushing out to repurchase in a hurry.

2019-08,5.0,"For the past 2 weeks I've been on an OGX shampoo &amp; conditioner spree. So many new ones out with excellent reviews online that I just had to try. First up was the 'Purifying + Charcoal Detox' Shampoo. This one caught my attention as I'm a big fan of Briogeo's Charcoal shampoo but it is pricey and would be great if I could find a cheaper alternative. So first impressions... I'm impressed! The scent in here is slightly on the masculine side but don't let that put you off. For a Sulfate-free shampoo this cleanses really well and lathers decently too. It could be the combination of charcoal and Kaolin (clay) but there's much less build-up than normal and my scalp actually feels much calmer and isn't flaking nor itchy which is fantastic. Have tried out some of the other OGX shampoos which I'll review seperately, but none compared to this for overall results on hair and scalp. Will definitely be repurchasing this!

I went to the nearest drugstore and started checking all the Organix lines in order to choose the one that suited my hair type the better, so I decided to go for the Kukui Conditioner as it says hydrates and defrizz (my life long battle with friizz is coming to and end!!!) and combine it with the Awapuhi ginger shampoo (this one is for repair hair), I decided to combine both lines for a fuller range of benefits and it's awesome, I've been using them for over a month and the change in my hair is undeniable!, it's shinier and smoother.

I have not tried the shampoo version yet, but I have used it in combination with different Organix and Live Clean products. 
The bottle is sleek and black, and the smell is not the best I've tried, but still good. I have wavy, blonde hair, it is currently shoulder length, but I have used this when I had very long hair as well. and this has always done a good job of conditioning it. 
This leaves my hair soft and shiny, and very healthy looking. It does not weigh my hair down at all. I find a lot of products either leave my hair poofy looking or too limp, but this does a good job of keeping it a little more defined and lively looking. 
I was surprised to see the bad reviews, I know no product can work for everyone, but my experience with this product has been excellent. Would recommend to people with similar hair types. ",Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner

It isn't as heavy as others that I have used on my hair but still makes my hair feel more conditioned than any other ones I have used. 
The bottle shape is cute but is quite annoying as there will still be so much in there yet you have to squeeze the wide sides as the shape is a bit impractical. 

The brand Organix always goes on sale too which is a plus, I don't think I've even bought it for it's original price yet by the time I have to get another one! I'll probably jinx myself on that one now though.

Big mistake samething happened. I wanted to like it because everyone raves about this company. I just don't think it's worth damaging my hair.

2014-08,4.0,"[Edit: not sure if this conditioner has been reformulated since I wrote my review, but the conditioner in the newly repackaged skinnier bottle has an added vanilla scent so it's like a vanilla nut smell vs. the scent of the product that came in the flatter pancake shaped bottle which was kind of floral/nutty.]

This conditioner makes my hair sooooo glossy, it's ridiculous! The scent is amazing but I'm not sure how to describe it... it smells fresh and delicious but not super perfumey or overpowering. It's thick in texture but not super heavy; it turns thin once it touches your hair. If your hair gets super dry, you may need a more emollient conditioner. 

Whether or not I let my hair air dry or blow it out straight or use a diffuser to add waves, my hair always comes out glossy like I drizzled clear lip gloss over each strand. And I know it's just this conditioner and not due to the matching Kukui Oil shampoo since I don't always use it with its matching shampoo and my hair still comes out glossy. 

I wish it came in a larger size and a different bottle. The almost pancake-like shape of the bottle can be kind of clumsy. Otherwise it's a great sulfate-free, cruelty-free drugstore product that I'll definitely buy again. ",Hydrate + Defrizz Kukui Oil Conditioner

Kukui oil is actually pretty high on the ingredient list and it has a couple of cones which my hair doesn't mind. I just make sure to clarify every now and then. It gave decent slip but not as much as the Sea Minerals conditioner. It does hydrate and soften well and keeps frizz down. My hair looks shiny and it didn't pull out my curls. This is working out for me in the winter time slightly better than the Sea Minerals conditioner due to the fact that it doesn't contain as much glycerin.

I use it on dry hair and then I tousle it while it's still wet.  It dries very fast and since it's not too heavy (for me, anyway), I get the piecy look I like so much without my hair looking dirty, or greasy, or heavy.  The thing is not to overdo it.

2016-08,4.0,"This smells really really good. It is tropical and fresh. It does not dry my hair out but using this I either have to use dry shampoo or wash my hair every day. I think it makes my hair soft and shiny though. The packaging is really nice too and it definitely is unique. My hair is not very damaged so I don't know how well it would work for someone who has hair that is very dry, tangled, etc. Also I do think it is a little pricey for a drugstore level product. Overall, because of the scent and the way my hair feels after using it, I will probably keep buying this. If I could go without washing my hair every day, it would be perfect.",Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo
2016-08,1.0,"I know it's supposed to be organic and free of all the usual irritants but this shampoo makes my scalp itchy and flaky. I usually don't have dandruff and my skin is is pretty hardy and rarely reacts to anything. I've used it three times now and I haven't changed anything else with my hair routine. It cleans well but the itching is driving me insane.

This one though does not do a good job cleaning my hair. It leaves residue on my scalp, it makes my scalp itch, etc. It does smell good but it is not that great. It might be just that my hair doesn't absorb it that well but it's no good to me. ",Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo
2016-08,4.0,"This is the first time I have tried the OGX brand and because of the coconut water I decided to give it a try. I love the cute bottle and even more so that it is made from recycled resins. I think the smell is great, not too strong and it cleaned my fine hair very well and left it lightweight.

2016-08,4.0,"So recently I noticed my hair was getting super dry. My hair is super important to me so I obviously went on the hunt to find something to help. When I came across this shampoo I was hoping for the best but not really expecting to get it. Omg, I was so wrong. After one use I could already feel my hair being more hydrated like the product claims! Now it's been 3 uses and the results are very great. I'd say my hair is back on track to what it used to be. You really can't beat the price either!",Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo
2016-08,4.0,"I bought this shampoo as a set with the matching conditioner and a tangle-teaser while I was in hospital and desperate for some kind of soap/shampoo/body wash that didn't smell like chlorhexidine surgical scrub (the stuff the hospital supplies). It was pretty pricey $33NZD for 2 travel sized products and a full size Tangle-Teezer (lets face it, I probably paid for that brush more than the shampoo!) I was excited to try it because holy smokes it smells like heaven. After I bought it, I came here to see what other people thought about it (bit of a backwards/risky move reading reviews AFTER purchase, but then again I'm not well known for doing things in the normal order.) I was really worried that I'd just spent a bunch of money on a dud product since most people here with similar hair-types to mine think the best and only good thing about these products are how they smell and that they did nothing for their hair. 

I was pleasantly surprised, (my expectations were lower than Atlantis.) Firstly the shampoo has a really interesting kinda jelly like texture that lathers really nicely and gives a good clean, it smells like my trip to Samoa, tropical and coconutty, almost juicy. If I could eat this stuff safely I probably would. I initially tried it by itself since my hair is so fine if I walk in any kind of humid air it turns into a flat greasy mess and let it air dry. It was shiny, and soft but almost a little dry so I followed it up with the conditioner the next day. WOW I almost never use conditioner in my hair since it makes it greasy and limp, but this combination of them both was fantastic. I have soft, shiny bouncy, tropical smelling hair AND a Tangle-Teezer. Booyah. 

Long story short:
Pros: 
-Smells amazing
-Cleans hair without leaving it feeling 'squeaky'
-Fun jelly-like texture and lathers nicely
-Doesn't leave my hair feeling weighed down like many shampoos.
         
Cons:
-Was a bit pricey but I'm pretty sure that the Tangle Teezer brush in the set was the real expense.
-Doesn't seem to be all that hydrating on it's own, needed the conditioner afterwards.
-I'm going to have to buy the full size of both products because they're lovely to use! (I live in NZ where everything is ~700% more expensive)",Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo

Cons: Can be difficult to get shampoo out of the bottle, due to the consistency, and the bottle shape means you cannot stand it on its head.

The pros: very high lather, faint scent, good cleansing power, excellent for keeping hair soft. If you prefer a gentle clarifier, this works. Some shampoo--like the very clarifying but sometimes TOO potent Aussie Volume--creates tangles but this one doesn't interfere with my curls. In fact, after trying it tonight, I think it's a keeper. I'm the cheapest person with shampoo but this one is worth the extra few dollars.

I have dark brown shoulder length fine straight hair with deposit only color. I was using the same brand sea mineral moisture line over the winter and before that the regular coconut line which my husband loves. Those were too heavy over the summer so I got the weightless coconut shampoo and conditioner.  I had been using a serum and a workable hair spray up to this point as well.  What I have noticed with the weightless coconut is more body and shine and I have also stopped using any styling products at all. I was not able to find the weightless coconut spray and hairspray was just drying my hair out so I quit everything except wash and condition. I have been doing this for several weeks and have shiny healthy looking hair. I love just blow drying and going. I know this is not for everyone but my hair feels so good I can't stop touching it. Worth a try if you use the conditioner also. I would not use just the shampoo as it will tangle. One gripe is the dome shaped top. When the product runs low you cannot turn it upside down easily.

Ive got naturally oily, but easily tangled hair (due to having my hair permed) so the dilemma was finding a shampoo that would not leave my hair oily, but not dry out my hair. So this shampoo did the trick.

2014-08,5.0,"I have to write this review because I think the product is underrated and probably not used correctly for those who scored it low.

Firstly, I have straight thick hair and it is quite picky in that the roots go oily quickly but I can't overwash as this irritates my scalp so I shampoo every 2nd day. And then my ends are bristly (thick hair) and can become dry. I've tried heaps of shampoo and so far this is awesome...BUT...you do have to use the whole set as recommended - 3 steps.

If you only use the shampoo in this set, it makes your hair very knotty and dry...even if you follow through with another organix conditioner (I've tried it with the Argan oil one and the cherry blossom). If you use the Coconut water shampoo and condition, the result is nice but not 'wow'. Then the other day the treatment oil was on sale so I decided to try. And oh my goodness, I should have done this from the start! The whole 3 steps was easy to use, you towel dry your hair after shampoo and condition, then spray evenly through and only blow dry for a little bit so I feel like my hair is really hydrated.

The end result is a very silky sheeny but not oily nor course looking hair. It was quite magical in the bathroom, like I just stepped out of a salon. My course ends are so plump and hydrated that it appears like I've got more volume in my hair. Amazing.",Weightless Hydration Coconut Water Shampoo

2019-08,5.0,"This stuff is AWESOMESAUCE.  I've been using this oil for years, and I swear it has made a huge difference with my fine, color-treated, straight dry and damaged hair.  

I lighten my hair every month.  Being that it is baby-fine, it can develop a lot of dryness and damage.  

This oil is absolutely wonderful.  I use it two ways.  I use it after washing my hair.  While it's still damp but after towel-drying, I spray it in and it completely helps reduce tangling while I'm blow-drying.  I find that it makes my hair so silky and smooth.  

I also use this after my hair is dried.  I spray a little on the ends of my hair, and wait for a couple of minutes for it to absorb.  I go ahead and brush my hair, and it makes my hair so soft and shiny.  

I have tried other leave-in treatments and oils, but none of them have absorbed into my hair like this one does.  Usually, they leave my hair feeling greasy and flat.  This one doesn't.  Initially, it will look a little oily, but after a few minutes, it penetrates the hair shaft and makes it feel stronger.  

The smell is a bit strong but I find it pleasant.  It also dissipates after a minute or two.  I will continue to buy this.  It is very affordable, and I can find it at my local Walmart sometimes on sale for around $7 - $8 CAD.

2017-08,3.0,"I finally finished up my container of this product. it lasted me just over 6 months and although I didn't use it daily, i would estimate I used it about 4 days per week on average. the paackaging is okay, but I did not like that this product is constantly exposed to the air when I was using it. I would prefer a squeeze tube for a thick product that is able to dry out if the lid is not on. I found it tedious to constantly unscrew and screw the cap back  on with every use. I also have long nails and disliked that product would usually get trapped under them after use since you have to dig into this product due to the packaging. I have hair that is down to my bra strap in the back and I prefer to use a pea sized amount. if I use more than that my hair can look stringy. I only applied this to the bottom half of my hair and not the roots. I love the smell. it smells like true coconut and not that sweet, fake coconut fragrance. at first I used this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner from the same line, then later with Organix Sea Mineral Moisture shampoo and conditioner. It behaved approximately the same with both, but I will mention I vastly prefer the sea mineral line to this coconut curls line because my hair really needs the moisture and became a bit dried out when I was using only the coconut curls products. I used this on its own for about half the tub, then for the other half of the tub of product I used it mixed with It's a 10 serum. I like neither one of these leave in conditioners alone, but have really been enjoying them mixed together. I used one pea size of this hair butter and then one half a squirt of the it's a 10 serum. I decided to mix them because when used alone, this product did take away frizz and make hair smoother and more moisturized LOOKING, but my hair was not actually benefiting from it. I still got the same amount of split ends when I went for my hair trims and dryness at the ends of my hair on days when I didn't use it. with the combo i have had slightly less split ends and my ends are more moisturized when I skip any hair products and just shampoo and condition due to laziness. overall I will not be repurchasing and will continue experimenting with new products. I wouldn't recommend this because there is no lasting benefit to using this in my opinion and to me that is the whole point of using a leave in treatment.

2016-08,5.0,"So I acquired this at a family reunion. I was running low on the oil I put in my hair, so I thought I would try it. I have not tried as a conditioner to rinse out, but I absolutely adore it as a leave in. The smell is amazing and I don't think my hair has been so soft and bouncy in the longest time. I don't have to use a lot to get what I wanted. I would without a single doubt buy this numerous times over. I can't wait to see how it fairs in the winter weather. But with the humid summer weather it keeps my hair from going into a frizzy uncontrollable mess, so it already scored wonderfully to me.  ",Quenching Coconut Curls Curling Hair Butter
2015-08,5.0,"for reference i have thin, wavy hair (2a) and lots of it.  I've been dying my hair for almost 20 years, it was looking dull and limp.

OGX released this line new for 2016.  I was browsing Walgreen's hair selection in search of a new deep conditioner and/or leave in as my current ones were running out and did nothing to WHOA me to repurchase. Thats when this quenching coconut curls line caught my attention.

I initially only purchased this curling hair butter to use as a deep conditioner, thinking as a leave in it would be much to heavy for my fine hair. And if your looking for a moisture boost its great to use.

BUT YOU GUYS, as a leave in, O-M-G.  My curls have so much LIFE and bounce to them, curls i didn't even know i had. You only need a tiny bit as this is a very rich moisturizing conditioner.  It smells divine, the texture is so buttery.  My hair looks 10 times healthier in just a few weeks.

I loved this so much i went out and bought the matching frizz-defying moisture mousse and will soon be purchasing the shampoo and conditioner to try out.

I have naturally spiral curly hair 3b mixed with 3a &amp; 3c's  and got this last year when it 1st came out. When using it as a leave in a little goes a long way IMO (my hair is bra strap length).

2018-08,1.0,"With my limp fine locks, I'm always on the lookout for the next product that might give my mane a little boost.
Recently, I was surveying the OGX line for its new products, and the spray mousse caught my eye thanks to its attractive packaging and the promise of 'bodifying' effect.

When I saw the mousse on sale at a local drugstore, I had to have it. 

As I'm sitting with my hair now dry, but previously drenched with the mousse as instructed, I have only regrets. Money wasted, hair akin to dry straw.

2016-08,1.0,"This is for the Root Booster, not to be confused with the Fiber Cream. The bottles are almost identical except for the nozzle. This one has a spray nozzle with a cover so you can spray it close to the roots. The instructions say to &quot;lightly mist&quot; onto clean damp hair, concentrating on the roots. You can't lightly mist very well with the type of nozzle, but it is good for getting the product into the roots. It is a watery solution with little to no scent that is easy to work into roots once sprayed. I tried this on 3 separate occasions after using my usual shampoo &amp; conditioner, and styling the usual way. It failed (hugely!) 3 times.
I used 3 - 8 sprays, trying different techniques to see if maybe I was using too much or too little product. All had the same results. I have thin, medium thickness hair cut into a pixie that I wear messy. This made my hair look completely flat...like a hair helmet. No matter what I did, it turned out the same. Epic fail!

You literally have to put the shampoo on your head because it will fall out of your hands. I find that the product doesn’t lather with the ease of most shampoos.

This has such a light floral, sort of white tea scent and it's in a pretty emerald green bottle. But...I don't like the product, unfortunately. It has the strangest jelly texture I've ever experienced. It spurts out of the bottle in clumps and doesn't flow at all- have to shake the bottle hard to get it into the neck. I hate the OGX bottles since with rounded caps you can't store them inverted. Have to use more than I'd like to get it to lather and clean my hair.

Nice scent though, and definitely doesn't leave build up, so that's good.",Pomegranate & Ginger Conditioner
2018-08,4.0,"I said I wouldn't buy this product again because right now I'm experimenting with different shampoos to see which one I need, so when this one runs out I will be trying a different one, if only to compare.

I've been growing my hair out for a couple of years now and it's gotten fairly long, I'm proud, however breakage has become an issue.  I don't even know if it's breakage or just losing hair from my scalp but there is a lot in the shower when I'm done and even more coming out in my hands once it's dry.  I have oily(ish) roots and dry ends, like most people with longer straight hair, I would assume.  I usually wash my hair every 2 or 3 days, second day is a hair up day and if I go 3 days it's a dry shampoo day (up I go around looking greasy, I really don't care that much).  My hair is decently thick, medium to thick maybe?  But the hair itse;f is fine, I hope that makes sense.  I usually only shampoo my roots and keep conditioner away from my roots (I just flip the rest of my hair over the top of my head as I'm rinsing so there's some moisture there but nothing that will weigh down my hair or make it oily.)  A lot of shampoos in that past have made my scalp itchy after washing them to I figured I would try sulfate free.

Okay so, this stuff.  I like it.  The shampoo is really thick which I kind of like because I don't accidentally squeeze out too much.  With a sulfate-free shampoo, the sulfates aren't doing all of the work for you so you really have to make sure that you rub it into your scalp.  I like this shampoo because I can wash all of my hair, down to the ends, and they don't get crunchy.  The conditioner is actually less thick than others that I've used, I still do my usual &quot;no roots&quot; routine with this one.  I usually use probably way more conditioner than I need, but I've been doing well at limiting myself with this one and it seems fine.  Once I'm done i've found that it's really easy to (gently) brush my hair when it's wet, before it's even dry it feels softer and silkier.  I have noticed less fallout with both wet and dry hair too!

This stuff makes my hair soft and silky, maybe too much so because I think my hair is more prone to static with this line.  My second day hair seems oiler than before I started with this line, but I also am just figuring out how to use a sulfate-free shampoo so this may be due to user error, or it could be because it doesn't dry my scalp to oblivion.  less itchy scalp is probably worth it.  I haven't tried going three days without washing, it's just too much.  I'm working on it and I'll update when I finish what I have now.

Pros:
Smells nice
Don't need a lot
Soft Hair
Sulfate free 
Doesn't dry out my hair
Less fallout

Cons:
Static-prone
More oily on day 2

2017-08,2.0,I have very fine thin hair that breaks easily.  This did nothing to strengthen my hair (i waited to give my review after using the entire bottle in case it needed to build up).  Hair still breaks easily.  It wasn't a bad shampoo but nothing special.  I also went thru it very fast because it is a thick formula.  Also the containers are annoyingly thick so you can't get it all out.,Anti Breakage Keratin oil
2016-08,4.0,"I have bought this shampoo when I realised that a lot of drugstore shampoos I've been using have sulfate in them, which is apparently very bad for your hair. I have very thin, oily hair (with dry ends, from coloring it) and it was very hard for me to switch to sulfate free shampoo, since it doesn't foam as much, and leaves a feeling of not freshly washed hair. But...when a preson gets used to it, the difference is noticable. My hair seems to fall out less, it is shinier, and it doesn't get a lot more oily( but not any less, either). The smell is fantastic, but I would prefer it sticks longer, it fades when you rinse your hair almost immediately. After rinsing my hair, I use Dove hair mask, which is good, but I would like to try Ogx conditioner....but, the price is just too much! It is around 10 euros, and I am aware that with all this youtube and internet craze those prices are considered cheap, but that number is not as low for an avarege consumer! I don't wash my hair every day (I wash it every forth), so it lasts me, but man, it is a shampoo! I literally wash it down the drain, so 20 euros for shampoo and conditioner are a bit too high prices for my taste.

All in all here are pros and cons...
Pros:  
less hair loss
shinier hair
smells great

Cons:

2016-08,3.0,"I'm on the search for a new shampoo and conditioner combo that prevents breakage, as I have fly-aways like you wouldn't believe (mostly caused by brushing my long, straight hair too much with the wrong brush, but possibly also due to using harsh shampoos). I figured I might as well review the different products I'm trying out, since this site is informing my choices! 

This one felt good in the shower, but I actually had more frizz and fly-aways the next day. I can't tell whether or not it can prevent breakage, but I'm not a fan of the look it gives me.

I have tried a few of the Organix shampoo, conditioners. I have tried the Brazilian keratin, renewing argan oil, coconut milk and macadamia oil. The coconut milk line and the anti breakage keratin are my two faves. I was in Harmon which by the way has the lowest every day price to buy the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and styling products but I could not resist this one . I will say the coconut milk and anti breakage keratin are both great. I love this one a little more. The packaging is cute and durable and they have different sizes. I keep using this one even though I have more coconut milk left . It lathers well , it smells incredible and after I shampoo and rinse it leaves my hair soft and the conditioner just adds more softness. The conditioner is thick but not too thick. It does not weigh my hair down if anything it gives my hair volume and my hair doesn't feel greasy on a few days of no washing. Also I purchased the Brazilian keratin spray not the anti breakage spray because they did not have it in stock but honestly the one I have is great and I use it on my towel dried hair then again before I flat iron it. All of their products smell incredible, great cute durable packaging , great quality for the price and it's not tested on animals and the packaging is made from recycled materials .

2018-08,4.0,"My favorite thing about this product is actually the smell. It strikes a rare balance of fresh and soft, without bordering into something artificial, like men's shaving cream territory. It's smooth and oceanic. I would scent my house with a fragrance like this.

So I bought it after smelling it in the drugstore, 1. for the fragrance 2. pretty good size for the price 3. because it's sls-free. After seeing what a difference it made going sls-free with my hair, cleaning it without stripping it of its natural moisture barrier, I thought it would probably be a good thing to try for the skin on my body, too. However, I was skeptical of how moisturizing this would be. Maybe it's just marketing, but I've come to associate clear body washes with not moisturizing, and opaque body washes with moisturizing properties. I know how stupid that sounds, but it's hard to overcome some of those associations.

Anyways, I've gone through 2 bottles in the spring and summer, and I really like it. I felt clean, but with none of that prickly dry feeling that sends you running for the body lotion after the shower. The smell is awesome while you're in the shower, but it doesn't linger on your skin.

That said, I don't think it's going to be quite moisturizing enough in the winter, so I'll be trying out the OGX Coconut body wash to see how that goes.

2018-08,3.0,"Just remembered to write a review on this...

It's not a salon quality at home treatment, hence the price point. This lasts supposedly 30 days rather than months. It is a good alternative if you prefer DIY, or even don't want to shell out so much $$$ at once for a professional service. But there are better options for at home keratin treatments on the market, research around.

Did this last 30 days for me? No.
Was the results amazing? No.

But it did strengthen and defrizz my hair quite a bit for a few weeks. Hair felt sleeker, just not miraculously.

This is pretty fool proof for any newbies out there. Just keep your hair dry &amp; straight a few days after applying.

I have a lot of hair, and it's long. It was waist length the last time I used this. The entire bottle is supposed to be one application BUT I used way less than that, a little goes a long way. So it lasted for several treatments, further improving the bang for my buck.

The instructions were easy to follow, and blow drying was like a dream. My blow drying time was cut in half, taking about 20 minutes instead of 45. However, the flat ironing process and everything that came after that was pretty tedious. I used the highest setting of heat, and straightened small sections of hair a total of 10 times. But that’s a lot of sections and it took a lot of time!!! Afterwards my hair felt very waxy, but was quite shiny. The treatment had to then be kept in the hair for 48 hours and then washed out to be blow dried and flat ironed again. I experienced no reversion while my hair was straight until the humidity levels shot up like a madman. Also, 95% of my “curl” was not eliminated; 60% maybe. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to escape the price of a professional BKT and those who may have a problem with frizz or blow drying their hair altogether. All in all, I would buy it again, but it’s not something I need or can’t live without. I was happy with the results though, minus my hair reverting when the weather got humid.

Both of you- brush your shit out w a paddle brush from ends to scalp, then brush hair EASILY w round brush, wind hair down to scalp in round brush, FOCUS THE HEAT ON YOUR ROOTS, IF YOUR ROOTS ARE UNRULY YOU LOSE THE GAME. feel free to use the paddlebrush. Use the concentrator on your bd or get one.

-Oh, section your hair and have like plastic clips to hold them up before you do this

-i read somewhere dont use CHI? Something about ceramic sucking up the shit. I used my old dusty trusty tourmalline from H.S. Hottest setting, please.

-burn the FUCK out your hair and pull that flatiron down straight. There should be smoke. Hit the nape and edges, around ears. Thats what ppl notice when you flirtatiously play with your hair/put it up.

 
UPDATE! I love this i love this i love this.

I recommend: john frieda gloss (use on dry hair, sit for 20m); john frieda (insert your hair color here) shampoo; tresseme anti breakage with b12 and gelatin; chi infra treatment; dollar store VO5 CLARIFYING SHAMPOO (yes I said do a clarifying shampoo after all that-- the treatment will only work if you've clarified all the excess layers of stuff you've done).

2014-08,3.0,"Final Update (After 2nd use)
I used it again after 30 days. I used a 450 F flat iron to seal the product in and I think it made all the difference. 

Results :  I blow dryed and flat ironed my hair after the wash.
1) I did not lose my curl pattern - my hair still had waves in it.  It hadn't become completely straight
2) less blow drying and flat iron time
3) my hair looks smooth, shiny and has the &quot;healthy&quot; look to it. It kind of has a nice swing to it - my hair has more movement and it is more fluid.
4) It is holding up well without frizzing up in humidity.

Cons : it has horrible wet dog stench to it after washing, its just horrendous and unbearable.

Final thoughts:
I may purchase this again because you cant go wrong for $15 and I really like this product .
 But the effects are not long lasting . I'd rather buy a $50 product whose effect last for 3 months or so. Its a PITA to do this treatment every month. 
That being said, I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a smoothing treatment on budget and formaldehyde free . This product is worth its price.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Updat week 2-3 


My hair is starting to feel normal already (partly because I got into the pool a few days back - i think the chlorinated water ruined the treatment). The back of my hair is starting to get frizzy, rest of the hair is fine(no frizz). And my hair is getting poofy (1 lippie off for that :( )

My ends are starting to look brassy and fried , they seemed healthy right after the treatment. 

All in all - i think you get what you pay for. But do try this product ,its a decent treatment for the price . 

Will I buy this again? I dont know. I am gonna try doing this again with a 450 flat iron after 30 days and i'll see if its any better the second time.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've always been interested in trying out keratin treatments since I've heard about them. I dont have 300$ to shell out for bkt at salon and decided to do a at home keratin treatment. So, i got this - you know, just to test the waters

What I was looking for : I have a 2b-ish wavy, thick , asian hair.  I wanted to cut down my blow drying time. It takes 30-45 minutes and its a PITA trying to tame down the frizzies and also relax my waves.

About the process : Few observations
I did not notice any fumes but the smell is certainly not pleasant. Please do it in a well ventilated area.
Do it when you have time . It is plain torture to just sit for 48 hours with a helmet head and trying to straighten out the kinks.


Results :
My blowdrying time was cut to 15 mins !! I was ecstatic. And it was a breeze to blow dry my hair. I blow dry it with a round brush and its always me sweating, huffing and puffing every mornig. I love this stuff !

Curl pattern - I havent air dryed my hair. But my curl pattern remained the same on wet hair, so I dont think this did anything to straighten my waves. I used a 410 F flat iron to straighten my hair during the process .

Frizz - NADA. I mean this is awesome. I dont know how long this is gonna last but I live in a pretty humid city (60%-70% humidity) and my hair is holding up pretty well

Texture - Now this is what bummed me. I dont know if this is the heat damage (due to obsessively trying to striaghten out the kinks) or me skipping the argan oil (i just used my redken heat protectant) , the texture of my hair seemed a bit rougher than usual. :( 

Smell - I did not see any smell post wash. My hair smells like my shampoo ( organix keratin shampoo)

So far, I am impressed and I will update on the longevity of the treatment.The only con so far is the 48 hour wait period with a smelly hair.",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2014-08,4.0,"I read all of the reviews (positive and negative) and they were very helpful. I did not expect for my hair to be straight without blow drying and flat ironing.  It's not &quot;naturally straight&quot; due to the treatment.  It is, however, noticeably easier to blow out and flat iron.  The improvement in frizz is HUGE.  I've always struggled with frizz, especially in the Summer, and this product is so helpful.  I can tell you that if you live at the beach, it might not hold up to beach humidity.  The first week after I did the treatment, I was at the beach and my hair stayed relatively frizz free when it wasn't super humid but did frizz up when it was very humid.  That's why I didn't give it 5 lippies, but maybe I'm expecting too much!  When I got back home (DC suburb), I was thrilled.  It's very humid here in the summer and my hair has been looking really good.  It's been 3 weeks and it's looking just as good as when I first did the treatment.  I do wash my hair every other day for the most part, so maybe that helps with staying power.  I'm using sulfate free products - both Organix and also Loreal Oleo Therapy shampoos and conditioners.  

Regarding the application:  I took the advice of some reviewers and was careful not to oversaturate my hair with the treatment.  I applied it as I would a leave-in conditioner.  I have armpit length hair (and a lot of it), and I'd say I used half of the treatment.  Which is great, because now I have a second application.  Can't beat that for a grand total of $15!  As to the smell of the treatment, it is not pretty but it's not too terrible.  I'd say slightly more than medium stinky ;).  I used my Karmin tourmaline flat iron, which goes up to 450 degrees.  I would say I did 5 or 6 passes with iron for each section of hair, not 7-10 as the directions specify.  Just my preference at the time and it worked out fine.  All in all, the entire treatment - from shampoo to finishing flat ironing - took me just over an hour.  I've been blowing out and flat ironing my hair for years, so maybe that helped.  I was very strict about waiting the 48 hours to shampoo and ended up waiting an extra 10 hours or so (waited till the morning after the 48 hours were up).  My hair looked semi-decent after 48 hours but was not presentable by the next morning.  It felt great to shampoo it!  

All in all, I am very happy with the results of this product.  I've recommended it to friends and will use it again!  My hair feels and looks great and it's so nice to go out and come back home and my hair still looks good despite the humidity!",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2013-08,5.0,"Absolutely LOVE this product. To be honest, after reading reviews about the horrible smell, leaving hair greasy and how difficult it is to apply, I almost decided not to use it! But I did pay for it so I decided to try it myself. I am SO glad I did because it is amazing!

I think those that had problems with greasy nasty hair and toxic smell used WAY too much of the straightening product. Also, you have to be sure your hair is towel dried with no dripping. I treated this product as I would a leave in conditioner. I used sparingly (since I knew I wouldn't be washing it out) I made sure I used enough to coat it and of course combed it through really well. I combed it the entire 30 minutes of the leave in time. Then I blow dried it and used the flat iron. No hassle whatsoever. It was super easy to use! Easier than coloring products. Pretty much like a styling product or a leave in conditioner. 


FYI
I Hispanic. My hair is dark, long with a bit of wave and a little damaged. I bought it to defrizz and tame it. The fly aways and frizz have just been awful. This product made it look just like the girl on the box. No more friz, no more fly aways, just straight, sleek and gorgeous. 

I will definitely buy it again.

2013-08,4.0,"After I moved down South, I immediately began struggling with the humidity and the constant frizzy state of my normally tame hair. I tried a few moisturizing serums and conditioners and nothing tamed the frizz, so I bought this product. However, I was not interested in having straight hair, just frizz-free. I straightened my hair according to the directions, waited a day, and then used a flat-iron on braids and twists in order to regain my waves. After washing my hair around the 40 hour mark and applying an anti-frizz serum, my hair was good to go--wavy, shiny, and frizz-less. However, I do not dye or use heat on my hair, so those who do might have more unruly results. ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment

waves left..not pin straight. Well, I did this about 4 months ago and my hair is still
a big mess. Of course I want my curls back..no such luck..my hair now looks sort of
like I have a really bad perm...waves here..straight there..and my curls are underneath(obviously missed the underside of my hair when I applied).

and just cut out the damage. I will not recommend nor repurchase.",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2013-08,3.0,"About two years ago, I finally decided to do something about my unruly, frizz ball hair. After doing extensive research (ie I went online and read a bit), I went to a very fashionable (ie expensive with loud music) salon and got a keratin treatment. To say I loved the results is an understatement. My hair was soft, manageable and I could actually straighten it with my trust Chi in less than 30 minutes! I felt like I solved the riddle of the Sphinx! Well, at least the riddle to my mop of tangled, frizzy curls which is just as noteworthy in my book. Over the next 18 months or so, I found a more reasonably priced salon and got three more treatments.

Cut to today - I'm just starting out at a new job and my finances are those of a pauper. Yes, I have money for food, shelter and the occasional beauty product splurge but my hair looks awful. The frizz is back with a vengeance, it takes 45+ minutes to straighten this mess I jokingly call my hair and the curl comes back within a day because my hair has has decided to show me who is really in charge. I was at my wit's end and then I found out that a few companies have at home keratin treatments. I was hesitant to even try this because I've had terrible experiences with at home kits that take even a small amount of savvy to apply. I decided to take a chance because I honestly couldn't stand looking at my frizzy head any longer.

Included in this kit is a clarifying shampoo, gloves and a ample amount of keratin. You wash your hair, apply the keratin, wait 30 minutes and then flat iron your hair to seal in the keratin. Easy peasy, right? Well, yeah...kind of. I followed the instructions and even went the extra mile to pile my keratin soaked hair into a shower cap because that's what the salon folks did but I didn't exactly get salon results. At the salon, the stylists generally brush on the keratin mixture in very small amounts to very small sections of your hair. It takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r and frankly, I'm just not that patient or adept. I tried to ensure all my hair was coated and I paid special attention to my problem area (the top of my head mainly) and while I felt like I did a decent application job, my hair was still a bit difficult to straighten. It help to eliminate the frizz on my crown that will not budge but the hair near my scalp was still wavy despite several passes from my burning hot Chi. Perhaps my Chi doesn't get hot enough, the keratin isn't strong enough or my application technique sucks but I couldn't duplicate the results I got at the salon no matter how hard I tried.

I also felt like this left my hair feeling filmy and oddly weighed down. It wasn't dried out but it didn't feel super soft or particularly manageable. This filmy feeling left when I was able to wash my hair again but having slightly icky feeling hair for three days was hard to adjust to. I also didn't find that this lasts 30 days. My hair reverted back to its original frizzy state with 15 to 20 days despite the fact that I wash my hair every four days or so.

On the plus side, there's more than enough product in the kit to use this more than once. My hair is past my shoulders and pretty fine but I have oddles of it and I still managed to get my hair pretty well coated and still have enough left for two more uses (your mileage my vary). Overall, I got decent results with this kit. I can't swipe my Chi through my hair on the first go round and get it to straighten and stay straight for days on end like I can when I get this done professionally but it does knock out some of the frizz and makes my hair a bit easier to deal with. 

So would I recommend this at home kit instead of going to a salon? No. If you have the money, get the keratin treatment done professionally because it's well worth the time and money and a whole lot easier to pay someone to painstakingly brush your strands with keratin than for you to do it yourself. I would, however, recommend this to anyone who needs to tide them over until they can get to a salon. I think this does help with the frizz factor but it doesn't really do much beyond that. I also think this is reasonably priced considering that most salons charge 100+ for keratin treatments, especially if you can get more than one use out of one kit.

2013-08,4.0,"I love this product. i had previously chemically straightened my hair 5 times(yearly once) before using this product, so i needed control over my virgin hair and after reading other reviews, i assumed it wouldn't actually work but give it a try anyway.. i loved the results. My hair is partly wavy but frizzy and this product straightened my hair to natural straightness but not to an extent of chemical treatment. I followed instructions as in the box and washed my hair after 48 hrs. I love the feel of my hair.. the bounce,softness and shine... looks so much more healthier. I would definitely re-buy based on how long the product lasts on me. ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2013-08,4.0,"I totally agree with other reviewers that this product will not make your hair pin straight. I bought it to tame my frizzy, lifeless, perm-damaged hair. And it worked! I just left it on for 48 hours and wash/conditiong with shampoo and conditioner from the same line. My hair is still wavy but super glossy and shiny and is exactly what I wanted. Sort of like old Hollywood glam wavy hair.. if you know what I'm talking about... 
My hair is fairly long (mid-back) and is full. One bottle will last 2 treatments which is a good bargan.
My tip is that always wear gloves and never put on the treatment with bare hands. I forgot to put on gloves on my 2nd try and my hands feel so rough now.
I gave it 4 stars because you need to bear with greasy hair and can't tie it for 48 hours.But overall, it's a great product and I'll continue using it.

2013-08,3.0,"I just put this in my hair earlier this morning and so far no problems. The clarifying shampoo is awesome, it smelled so good. I don't know what some other people meant when they said the shampoo had a stringy texture because it was not stringy at all for me. It was kind of thin which wasn't a problem at all because it lathers up really well. After letting my hair dry 80%   (which just means it's mostly done drying but slightly damp) I then applied the treatment to 2inch sections of hair. Make sure not to just glob it on otherwise it will be oily it even states not to over saturate hair. After applying I blow dried hair and straightened my hair. My hair looked amazing after straightening it. My hair has never been so sleek after using a flat iron. My sister even commented on my hair and now she wants to try this product. After I see what my hair is like in 48 hours or so I will update this review.

So it has already been 48 hours later and I've washed my hair with Renpure moroccan argan oil shampoo and conditioner and then blow dried my hair. The products okay but like the package says results may vary. My hair is slightly wavy near the ends but otherwise it's decently straight. It was actually easier to comb my hair after getting a shower because I usually have tangles everywhere and my hair is softer and more moisturized. Overall I probably would not buy this again if I wanted my hair to be slick straight. I have about half of this left over. Maybe if I do it again my hair may become straighter. If you do it continually over time hair may remain straighter. Who knows...",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment

I used a hair dye applicator brush, and made sure the strands were coated, but not over saturated. That is the key!!  I blow dried with a comb attachment and then flat ironed at about 410 degrees.

And I still had amazing results! Keep in mind I otherwise have virgin hair, and it is only wavy not super curly or course. I did this to control frizz.

2012-08,3.0,"Okay, so you may be wondering why i gave this such low reviews and then say i want to buy it again. The reason is simple. It doesn't do what it claims to do, but i love the product. So my hair naturally REALLY wavy/culy and kind of dry on the ends. So i used the serum and shampoo and conditioner in hopes that it would help straighten out my crazy locks. It doesn't do that. Cat out of the bag. Oh well, i'll live. The shampoo is a REALLY strange consistency, almost mucusy... weird. It super thick and if i put it in my hand before applying it to my hair half of it slops out before it even gets into my hair! it doesn't spread well either. if i apply it to my scalp... it wont reach the ends of my hair... it smelled REALLY good though. i mixed it with some water and now after i do my regular shampoo i'll apply a little along my hair line for that wonderful coconut aroma. The conditioner is a little too light for my taste. My hair needs a very thick conditioner to satisfy my thirsty hair. So not using those two products ever again (plus they were pretty expensive) but then i tried the serum. OMG. so if i'm planning on straightening my hair (at least once a week) i always blow dry it before hand. It looks more more healthy and vibrant versus straightening after it has dried curly. The only problem with this method of blow dry before straighten is that if i'm planning to go out right after... my hair is kind of frizzy, solution= do this before i go to bed and i'll wake up less frizzy. But when i use this serum i don't need to wait a few hours for my hair to settle. it looks shiny and smooth from the get go! It also smells super good and feels warm and smooth in my hands. Only complaint in the packaging. While it looks beautiful with the bronze/gold colors and is eco-friendly (a nice little plus) it's not a pump applicator for the serum and it drips down the sides of the bottle... ugh. so then i have to apply it in my hair and then wash the bottle off EVERY. TIME. I. USE. IT. so annoying after using it almost everyday... that's another point. I use this everyday on the tips of my hair to prevent them from looking too dry.

2012-08,3.0,"Update 3# One year later. ONE.YEAR. I'm not updating this review becuase I've been using the product for one year, I'm updating because it's been a year since I put this product in my hair and the volume and curls are still gone from that one application in May of 2012. 
The Good: Well that was a bargain for certain and it's still controling volume. I don't know why my hair took to this as well as it did. The regrowth is curling again at the top but it's not too bad. 

The Bad: The ends when I don't take the time to flat iron are a mess, I actually can not leave the house without straigtening or it looks shaggy and ragged. Some mousse will tame that but the curls have not come back at all so this has the potential to permanently change the texture of your hair.

Update #2: This is advertised as a 30-day treatment. Well almost a month in my hair has completely lost any remnants of curl and is barely even wavy. And that's straight out of th shower with no blow out. It's also a fraction of the volume. I was expecting to have to redo this at the end of June but it looks like I may be good for at least another month as the results for me at least seem to be getting progressively better (flatter) shine is good and looks healthy. I have also just colored and it has not affected the results. I'm bumping up to a 5.

Update: After a night of sleeping on it...literally...I woke up and while my hair was messy it was still tame in the sense of no frizz and the volume was the same as when I went to bed. I will absolutely use this all summer long to control my hair.

The Hair: My hair is thick, curly and tends to frizz. Summer is especially painful. Essentially my hair has been the bane of my existence since as long as I can remember. My whole life the women who have oohed and aahed over my thick curls don't know what it's like on any given day to deal with the brillo pad/sheep/rhododendrun bush this type of hair can become. The worst part is that it just NEVER looks professional so I always have to wear it up in a school marm bun. Well, I fixed that and chopped it all off (it's now about 2 inches below my ears...was down the middle of back)... frizzy curls be d*mned. So I thought with a WAY more manageable length I'd give this treatment a try. 

The Goal: I, in no way, expected this product to give me pin straight hair. Anyone looking for this from a seventeen dollar product should probably level-set their expectations. I was looking for a way to decrease frizz and volume from the curls. The curls themselves start out ok but with each passing hour during the day my hair just gets bigger...and bigger...and BIGGER. I wanted to tame the follicle mushroom cloud.

The Process: All the other ladies said three hours...that's what it took. I clarified twice as recommended for my hair type. Added the treatment and let set. A couple of things kind of stumped me. First you're supposed to towel dry hair to 80% dry. Uhm...ok...what's THAT? So I took a guess and hoped it wasn't too damp/too dry to take treatment properly. Next kind of 'What gives' moment was the oversaturation everyone talks about. Again, I took a guess and went for about the same level as when you at home color your hair. The blow out took FOREVER (and I really don't think it's because I overdid it) but I knew what I was in for so just patiently stuck with it. It still felt 'damp' no matter how long I attacked it but that's because the product is still on your hair so you do feel residue. Ladies, if you have a 'cool' setting on your blow dryer get used to it with this blowout. After about 45 + minutes I decided I was done and got out the flat iron. Watch your fingers, your hair will burn you...450 degrees is HOT. That took about another 40+ minutes. Good news was my hair really took to the treatment during the 48 hour waiting period and looked really healthy and great.

The Smell: I'm pretty olfactory sensitive, I feel like I spend half my life saying to people &quot;I can't believe you DON'T smell that!&quot; I was prepared for toxic and barely smelled anything. Even when I was blowing out and flat ironing it was hardly anything. One thing I did notice was little yellow flakes of product on my lap after the blow out phase.

The Result: Today was the first wash and I didn't do anything with it, I just let nature take its course because I wanted to see what would happen to the curls. And it DID curl. Even while I was still in the shower it started curl up. After putting in a little mousse I ran my finger through it to 'stretch out' the curls and not only are they more relaxed but my hair is the same 'size' at 5:20 as it was at 8:30. It's a rainy day too which I wanted to test out. Not bad! It has taken down the frizz and controlled the volume considerably. The curl is loose and more of a nice wave and I am pleased with the result. I'm sure blown out or flat ironed it will be great. Overall I am satisfied and will bump my rating from a 3 to higher after a REAL humid day.

I followed their advice of not oversaturating the hair and really i only used like a quarter of the bottle but my hair felt really greasy but it was super straight. I waited the 2 days to wash it and after i did it was back to its very curly state. I thought it was a total waste of money. Well, last month i decided to give it another try after getting more tips on applying similar treatments. This time i made sure to comb through with a fine toothed comb to get the excess product off and evenly distribute it. I did everything else and wow! I loved the results. My hair had been bleached completely and i wanted something to coat it and make it shiny again and of course i wanted it to be soft again. This really helped improve the feel of my hair and it did loosen up alot of my curls. I think the first application can be a bit difficult but once you get the hang of it you can actually get really good results.                         Update: 6/07/2012 This stuff really ruined my curls!!!! when i wrote this review maybe a week or 2 had passed since application. at first i thought wow"" it really works. :) well i didnt realize just how much this was going to change my hair.after about a week i didnt want to be straightening my hair because obviously all that heat would damage my hair further. the problem was that after washing my hair  i noticed that the top 5 inches of my hair was very frizzy not curly kind of wavy then the bottom part was straight. I could not go out like that. before i could wash and go. now my hair was in a weird state of not curly not all the way straight. just frizzy and ugly. I wore my hair mostly in a bun or braids because it was so ugly not even shiny. so  ok.... after doing this a second time i retouched this a few weeks later cause i still had a little product left and i figured well its not curly and i cant get my curls the way they were so maybe i can just get it to be even.BAD IDEA! To this date my hair is in recovery. I soooo miss my curls. They are slowly coming back but i totally regret doing this to my hair. The only good thing is that i really learned to love what i had and i will not do this to my hair EVER again. If you love your curls do not do this. I have had the coppola treatments and i loved them because i could have both the curly and the straight. not with this. i would not reccomend this.'>I tried this product some time last year after reading reviews and watching many youtube videos.

2012-08,4.0,"I have very thin, very fine hair.  It breaks easily and causes frizz and flyaways.  I have to wash my hair every day, therefore I blowdry and straighten every day.  My hair is also coloured - Loreal Castings in Brownie. (semi-permanant)
I have been looking for a product to reduce the broken flyaways which had become out of control. I bought this as a stop-gap until I had another product delivered.  It was $30 at Priceline in Australia.  After reading the reviews I was almost too scared to try this product but I'm so glad I did!!  You hardly use any (this may be where people are going wrong) I used perhaps 1/16th of the bottle, if that.  Also as my hair is incredibly thin so I only left the product on for 36 hours.  When I strainghtened my hair with the product on it looked heavy but smooth and the straightest I have ever seen!  The smell is nice and, I imagine, only over-whelming if you have used far too much.  After washing it out I'd say my frizziness and flyways have reduced by at least 50%.  This is not a straightening product and dont expect miracles, it is simply designed to relax your hair and therefore smooth it.  I've been really pleased with the results and no stripping of my colour.  Will definately be using again.",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment

I waited out the requisite two days with limp, smelly, flat hair only to wash it out and find my hair's texture only slightly improved, at the expense of its colour.  But I'm really compelled to write this because I've just read that the manufacturer has been taken to task for misrepresenting the product as formaldehyde free.  Tests* show it does indeed contain this nasty, so best stay well clear of it.  I think if you live in Australia you can even get a refund.  Even though traces of formaldehyde may be present, unlabelled, in lots of products, I think this product deserves a dishonourable mention for dodgy ingredient listing and outright falsehoods.

It did absolutely nothing to tame my unruly curl and what's worse is that I had to spend two days avoiding water like the plague and sleeping awkwardly to prevent my hair from developing kinks.  All in vain.  Not to mention the waste of a perfectly usable 30 bucks, though I would never recommend this product at any price...  Until I can afford to get the treatment done professionally, the flat iron (though brutally damaging) is my only saviour.",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2011-08,2.0,"I had high hopes this would work for me. I have unevenly wavy hair that is very thick, so I wanted to make it more manageable and hopefully be able to let it air dry. 
  

I followed directions. However, my iron only went up to 400 and it has ceramic plates. I have a suspicion that this simply won't work well with the product, and that's why I had a disappointing experience.


It lightened the dyed portion of my hair a few shades. My hair also feels very dry... Which is a shame because I felt as though it had finally healed from the dying I stopped a few months ago. The smell was pretty bad, but mostly because I got sick of it. At least it smells kind of like perfume, so I hope I didn't bother anyone at work during the 2 days I had it in! I never thought I would make the 2 days without washing... But I did. The second day isn't as bad as you might imagine.


The straightening results? My hair dries the same way it always did. Disappointing. However, it dries faster with my blow dryer and there are slightly less kinks when I flat iron. I do find that my hair is now more impressionable... For example, if I pin my bangs up and I want them back down, I have to strait iron them or else they will want to stand up. Same goes for putting my hair in a pony or tucking hair behind my ears. It's very inconvenient and I sort of miss my flowy hair. 


Bottom line -- it did lighten my dark hair, didn't affect my natural hair texture, made my hair want to mold to everything, and dried out &amp; damaged my ends. However, it is faster to blow dry and I find it lays flatter after I flat iron. Worth it? Not at all. I miss my flowy hair. I hope my hair is back to normal by the end of the month.

2011-08,2.0,"OK so first things first. Some of the reviews on here are for the shampoo, conditioner or other products in the range. This is for the 30 day smooth treatment. Secondly, unlike others, I did follow the full guidance for this treatment, most importantly I used a straightening iron that actually went up to the specified temperature 

My hair is a mixture of 2b and 2c curls, with normal porosity and normal elasticity, medium coarse texture. It is just past jaw length, just above shoulder. I have had 2 BKTs in the past but they are no longer in my hair. I blow dry and straighten my hair regularly. I bought this product on a whim, and did not expect it to give me full salon results, however did expect more.

I washed and clarified with the provided shampoo, then left my hair to dry til 80% dry. The product is 100ml, however you don't need the full bottle. To ensure I got a really smooth even coating on my hair, without applying too much product, I applied it by dipping a very fine tooth comb into the solution, wiping off some of the excess and then combing it from root to tip through my hair. This method allowed for each strand to be lightly coated however any excess came off on the comb. Using this method I used just over half the bottle.

I then blow dried and straightened, running the iron through small sections at least 8 times. People have complained about the smell, I noticed a chocolatey cocoa smell and a lot of steam coming off when I was doing it. My hair got so hot that I could not touch each section with bare hands after running the iron over it. I used the Babylis Curl and Straight on full power (230'C/ 445'f).

Once the ironing was finished, I was left with heavy, coated hair. Then began the torture of the 48 hour wait. My hair didn't look really greasy, however it definitely did not look clean at all. I avoided getting my hair wet and made sure I ran over it with the irons after sleeping to get any kinks out. I think that the feeling is partly because it is top heavy with cocoa butter.

And the result? Well, after 48 hours I was desperate to get the evil gunk out of my hair. After washing it out with a sulfate free and sodium chloride free shampoo and conditioner (Kirkland Hydrating) I towel dried. At this point I would say that about 80% of my curl was gone, however 0% of the frizz was gone.  The manufacturers state that it cuts drying time by 75%, however I have not even noticed that it has cut it down by 5%.

I have waited another week before writing this review to see how I get on with it and have to say I am not impressed. Whilst I never expected it to be the same result as a salon BKT, I am disappointed that it has taken out my curl, but left me with frizz. I would have preferred to have had curl but less frizz (wouldn't we all!). I still spend the same length of time drying and flat ironing, and haven't noticed any benefits at all.

Finally, the overall condition and texture of my hair has not been improved at all. In fact, I would say that I have had an increase in damage, split ends and dryness. ",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2011-08,1.0,"This is by far the worst product I have ever used to control my friz prone hair. I am a true supporter of Liquid Keratin but I fell for this product because it was so cheap at CVS. How stupid! Now I know why it was so cheap! It smells cheap like coconut and it looked like mayonaise on my hair. Horrible! I could hardly get it dry while my hair was totally butter! it was sooo fat. Really gross. After blow drying and using my iron it was hot and fat. The next morning my hair was full with a sort of rubber daindruff! And fat. And even wavy instead of straight! After 36 hours I washed it out. Never felt worse with my greasy hair. After washing my hair with the shampoo and conditioner of the same brand which smelled cheap of coconut again, it was as coarse and frizzy as it never was!!!

Background: 
My hair type/texture: brown long course wavy-ish, frizzy and straight near the roots. I have light blonde highlights that I did with an at home kit. 

I Needed: 
Hair to be manageable!!  I have no problem with my natural wavy texture.  The thing I hate is that it takes 45 mins to straighten, curl or get it to look half way decent because it's just so darn poufy. 

**I followed the directions on the packaging exactly!  So I'm not going to explain that here. If you can read this review...chances are you can read directions**

Flat Iron Used:
Fahrenheit Titanium - $30 at Marshall's/Ross/TJ Maxx - You NEED a flat iron that 
A. Goes up to 450 degrees F (essential to seal in the keratin to the hair shaft) and
B. has titanium plates (ceramic plates will absorb the keratin product OUT of your hair)
**the chi will NOT work**

Now my hair is soft, soooo much more manageable and the frizz....GONE. I can let it airdry with zero product and there is no poof whatsoever! :). It now takes 10 minutes to flat iron. Yes just 10 minutes!! My highlights did change to a darker kind of caramel color. Which I actually kind of like. :)

Bottom line:  do your research, follow the directions and don't expect your hair to become stick straight. I think most people had problems because they didn't follow the directions or they didn't research to find the right tools.  Also, This is a keratin treatment to rebuild your hair's structure and make it easier to manage, not to change it.  If you want stick straight hair, you need to get the Japanese chemical straightening treatment.

2011-08,1.0,"Long time user of this forum, first time reviewer.  I felt compelled to write a review after I used this product as it was so disappointing.  I have used a number of products from this brand and am generally really happy with them.  Their shampoos and conditioners are the best.  However, this product was a complete waste of my time and money.  I have very fine wavy/curly hair which tends to frizz on top and at the front.  I once paid $100 for a professional chemical straighten with amazing results.  I was only at the hair dresser for about an hour and she did not even need to straighten my hair with tongs.  I thought this product would have a smilar result, but it did absolutely nothing.  Admittedly my hair does feel a little softer, but this is not why i bought the product.  There is no reduction in curl or frizziness.  The product cost me about $30 Aus, which is not a lot compared to some products, but quite a lot for something with no results.  Plus for two days my hair felt quite greasy and I could not go to the gym or tie up my hair so it was quite inconvenient.  This is nothing but a time consuming over priced treatment.  I get the same results from using Kerastase Oleo-Relax masque, however the masque costs the same amount and last for a year and I only have to leave it in my hair for 10 minutes to get the same result.

IM AMAZED by the results after 1 day , usually after i starghten my hair and sleep on it , there is a major kink ! &amp; let me tell you i have massive fly aways and lots of friz, no i dont need to even brush it because its smooth , silky &amp; AMAZING! 

I DID NOT oversaturate  , My mum followed the directions every cautiously ! Now I have amazing hair which i hope will last the full month ! 

I do not know how people are complaining about the smell , it smelled absolutely deliscious to me and my mum even when we were starightening ! 

I RECOMMEND THIS TO PEOPLE WHO ARENT AFRAID OF A LITTLE COLOUR CHANGE , so prefably brunettes as it will chnge your colour if its colour treated. DO NOT OVERSTAURATE ! as this is the reason why people are complaining of greasy hair , mine is absolutely perfect ! You should do the process in a room with a fan or opened window as the straightener does give out a lot of fumes !

It kind of reminded me of Garnier's Perfect Blow, except the Organix is better because it's a cream, not a two step gel process. Also, the Organix does not stink at all. It is odorless.

Also, I didn't use the clarifying shampoo because it makes my hair feel like straw. I just put the smoothing treatment on my dry hair and it worked fantastic. 

I will buy again! I'd rather use this than the Garnier Perfect Blow. I typically do the real bkt because I my hair straight. With Organix smoothing, I think I can give up the bkt. I usually wind up having to straighten my hair 2-3 times per week, even after bkt treatment, plus it makes my hair feel like straw.

Update: It's been a few washes, and my hair is still soft. So it does have some lasting power. And, like I said, I didn't use the clarifying shampoo - that stuff is just awful. I always just toss it. I'm sure it's great for people with fine or oily hair.

Update: Okay, so I over processed my hair. It was horrible. I was about to cut it off because the last two inches of hair were unsightly and felt horribly. I heard that BKT is good for damaged hair. I figured I'd give this stuff a shot and it WORKED. Cannot believe it!!! My ends are super smooth. Just to be sure it wasn't a fluke, I've waited a month before using again.

Pre-wash: I ran out of the clarifying stuff that comes with the product, but I've had much better luck first using a more clarifying shampoo (I use Kerastase Oleo Relax), then using a protein shampoo (Phytonectar) and leaving that in my hair for about 20 minutes. Rinse that out and towel-dry hair.
2. Apply product: I use probably 4 quarter-sized dollops for my entire head. I keep it away from my roots and concentrate on the ends. Then I comb it through to make sure it's distributed.
3. Blow-dry: after 30 minutes (per instructions) I blow dry my hair as straight as I can get it. Make sure your hair is COMPLETELY dry.
4. Flat iron: this takes FOREVER, but it's worth it! Flat iron small sections of your hair. I use clips so I can get at certain problem areas where it's extra wavy. It's also super important to have a hand-held mirror so you can see behind you. My hair often feels straight when I touch it, but when I actually look at it in the mirror it's still really wavy. Your hair will get HOT, but be sure to get it as straight as possible.
5. Wait: yeah, 48 hours is a long time and not a lot of fun....but I find that my hair really doesn't look bad on day 2. It's a little flat, but still looks decent. I clip my bangs up, as I'm not really concerned about the product working on them. I re-flat iron in the morning of the second day and check throughout the day to make sure it's still straight.

This process works really well for me...it's tedious, but for $15 you can't really beat it! Prepare to spend a good 3 hours doing everything (washing, leaving it in, drying, ironing), but that's not really any worse than doing it in a salon. Great results here...will repurchase! Oh, and don't even think of buying the Organix S&amp;C-- that stuff is awful!!!",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2011-08,3.0,"Im from Australia so it cost me about $20 dollars for this. Since it was expensive I was expecting a lot more from it.

I have long, brown hair with split ends etc. Its naturally wavy/curly depending on how i let it dry. I blow dry and straighten my hair every few days.

I used just enough to coat my hair and left it in overnight cause it was quite late. In the morning, i quickly blow-dried it and straightened it and was VERY happy with the results. My hair was so soft and silky and it was really shiny. No problems with it being too oily. When I decided to wash my hair (which was a few days later), I think i used herbal essence or pantene, it was as if I never treated my hair! 
I wouldnt mind trying it again and using shampoo and conditioner that is safe.",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2011-08,4.0,"I knew I had to try this product, regardless of the mixed reviews.
First of all, anyone who tries this product should have a basic familiarity with keratin products and it probably helps if you've had one professionally applied so you have an idea of what to do. I am far from an expert on keratin/hair products, but I definitely did my research before getting a Brazilian Blowout in June which cost me over $400 with tip. A keratin treatment is not for everyone. It is very easy to &quot;overdose&quot; on protein. If your hair already has enough protein, a protein treatment will make your hair drier instead of moisturizing it. If you are using a shampoo with protein while you are getting protein treatments, that could make your hair drier as well. Yes, the box says it's safe for color treated hair, but it also says to do a strand test. This is an OVER THE COUNTER $15 treatment. You can't expect that it is going to give you pin straight hair (ok, I know, the box shouldn't claim that it does) and you really can't expect the same results as a $400 treatment done by a professional. It is disappointing to see a lot of the reviews reflect that mentality.
My opinion on the formaldehyde claims: Products are legally allowed to say there are no &quot;hydes&quot; if it's lower than a certain percentage. There are also other names they can go by. Is this right? Maybe not. But it's legal. And the small amount isn't going to kill you. If you lead an all organic lifestyle, this product probably isn't for you. However, chances are, you've probably come into contact with food that has worse chemicals or you've been in the sun without sunscreen, etcetc. You are not going to find a product that can do life-changing things to your hair without chemicals. Period. 
Now onto my experience. I have virgin, but incredibly dry hair. It is not straight, but not curly. Sort of like an undefined wave that I sometimes get compliments on, and sometimes, it just looks crazy. There is an underlayer of unmanageable frizz in my hair. No hair stylist I've ever been to seems to understand it. I have split ends all the time, including right after I get a haircut. I have pieces of thick hair and pieces of incredibly thin/fine/fragile hair that confuses people, including me. I pretty much never heat style it anymore, but I straighten my bangs and little fly away pieces on the side every morning. If I wash it, put some Sebastian Potion 9 in it, put it in a bun and let it air dry, it usually looks pretty decent. I got a BB in June of this year. I spent a lot of time doing research and finding a reputable salon listed on BB's site that also had good reviews. I was in love with my hair after I washed it the first time. I had a very soft wave that gave my hair body, but the frizz was essentially eliminated. Unfortunately, this lasted a month, max, and cost me half a week's pay. I used a Sulfate free shampoo and I wash my hair very infrequently (maybe 2x a week), so I was expecting the results would last at least 3 months, the minimum salons say. I was on the fence about what to do. The results were great, but for such a short period of time. I recently bought a Groupon for $150 for my next one. I'll have to tip about $70 because that's 20% of the original price. So $220 for that one...
Onto the product that I'm reviewing. I didn't really know what to expect. I'm currently traveling for work, so my options were to do this in a small hotel room where I can't open any windows or wait until I'm home in December. I'm impatient, so I figured I'd take my chances. When I got my original BB done, my eyes started tearing up even though there was a fan right next to me in a big open salon. It wasn't anything intolerable, but I did experience some sensitivity. I like the Shampoo that's included. I do wish the packet was a little bit bigger, because this bottle will last me at least 2 treatments, so I had to make the Shampoo last. It smells great. I followed the directions on the box and after my hair was &quot;about 80% dry&quot;, I started to apply the product. I noticed no sensitivity whatsoever. I accidentally got some on the back of my neck, but it didn't bother me. About half way through, I took the gloves off to try and get a better idea of how much product I had in my hair. I applied some without gloves and had no issues. I washed my hands thoroughly after I finished applying the product. The only thing I think the directions should be more clear about is not to &quot;oversaturate&quot; the hair. I also wish you could see through the bottle a little bit. I had planned on using about half the bottle, figuring that would be good for my almost elbow-length hair. My hair felt evenly coated, but definitely wasn't oozing product. Next I blow dried and flat ironed my hair after waiting 20-30 min. I didn't think the product smelled bad at all, although extra smoke came off which is definitely normal for these types of treatments. You should be flat ironing your hair repeatedly until your hair pretty much gets too hot to touch. That is what makes the product penetrate. Right now, my hair looks about the same as when I first got my $400+ treatment back in June. It feels a little heavier and not as soft, but I can tell the frizz was dimished. It does not look greasy (but my hair never does) and I may even leave the treatment in for more than 48 hours. I am going to update after I wash my hair, but so far, I feel like this product has produced almost equal results to an alternative that is MUCH more costly. This bottle cost $16 with tax and I have a full treatment left, so $8 for what I just did to my hair.

If this lasts through at least 2 washings, I'll bump my rating to a 5. If I wash the product out and there is NO change in my hair, I'll bump it down to a 3..",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2011-08,2.0,"I got this product yesterday at the drugstore. I've had the brazilian blowout before it got pulled from the market and I LOVED it! Too bad it was completely toxic.

Anyways, this claimed no formaldehyde, but after reading reviews there must be some chemical that I have not reacted well to. 

I did the procedure - long but that was expected.

Anyways something in it (or I'm coming down with a bug) has made me feel really sick. I was feeling so noxious that I had to take the afternoon off work and wash it out. I can still smell it though. 

After 20 hours of keeping it in, I can tell the curl is softer and it's easier to blow dry. I bet if I was able to handle the product and leave it in, it would be great.

2011-08,3.0,"I've had this box sitting in my bathroom for a while now and I just have gotten around to being able to use it seeing as how it is a 'process'. You have to follow the directions! And like it says, do not over saturate!! I think that's what I did and that's where I went wrong. Although I'm still happy with the results! So..I did like the directions said and towel dried my hair and applied to small sections and let it sit for 30 minutes. I think my hair was a little more than 80% wet and I put too much in my hair. I was just afraid I wasn't going to have enough. Once I started blow drying is when I realized I had too much in. It was sooooo oily and nasty feeling and I knew I wouldn't be able to handle 48 hours of it. I did flat iron it like it said just because I didn't want to completely waste it. I ended up leaving it on for about 3 hours before I decided to wash it out. I have a big bottle of the Ion Keratin Treatment so I figured I could always try again at a later time. I used the L'oreal Eversleek shampoo since it is sulfate and silicone free like the box suggests. I used the Eversleek conditioner and left it in for about 10-15 minutes. My hair felt sooooo nice when I washed everything out!! I can tell a difference in my hair even though I didn't follow the directions exactly. I'm letting it air dry and it's still somewhat wavy like it normally is but it still feels very smooth and there seems to be a lot less frizz. I think this treatment would be great if the directions are followed. I'm thinking of picking up another box next time I go to Walgreens and now I know not to use so much. A little bit goes a loooong way!!! But I would definitely recommend this to someone whose hair is in need of some serious help!

I think that some people are using the whole bottle and it says to not over saturate your hair, hence the greasy look.  I combed the product thru for 30 minutes to keep the hair as straight as possible.  I also waited until my hair was damp not wet to apply it.  It did not take me two hours to do this process, only about an hr from application to drying. Its a good product for $15.00.

i would defly recommend this to anyone who wants a keratin treatment but cant afford the salon prices. i will defly be doing this again in a month.

2011-08,1.0,"There's a lot of reasons why brazillian keratin treatments aren't found in stores like you'd find colour or perm kits, and the formaldehyde contained in them is one of those reasons; which is how, I imagine, this product made it onto shelves in the first place.

However, a lot of other factors play into the results you get with this, so bear with me as far as the grueling details. I'd just like to add that - yes, I am a stylist - but I'm also very aware of basic biochemistry, I'm a member of Naturallycurly and The Long Hair Community, and I have let myself lose money talking clients out of buying products that weren't ging to work for them. This is a review written entirely for your safety and the quality of your hair.

Firstly, did you know that salt from water softeners, the ocean, and certain types of shampoos and conditioners (even gentle ones like, for example, all of the lines you can purchase at TJs) can ruin (or at the very least, tamper with the results of) this type of BKT? You probably didn't. That's why salons prefer that you return to the salon to wash theirs out, where they can control this much better.

Or that the temperature of your flat iron during the process as well as how many times you pass it through the hair really is one of the MOST important parts? Your flat iron, depending on it's quality, probably isn't going to give results quite as accurate as most professional models. I've had a couple clients come in having issues with this product, and come to find out they were using an iron that was 5+ years old.

How about this; OSHA allows FORMALDEHYDE to be labelled as ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: methylene glycol, formalin, methylene oxide, paraform, formic aldehyde, methanal, oxomethane, oxymethylene, or CAS Number 50-00-0.

Most of these products contain some sort of &quot;aldehyde&quot; like formaldehyde because of the similarities between the ways that keratin and formaldehyde bond. As far as their molecular geometry, &quot;-aldehyde&quot; bonds are slightly 'cleaner', thus stronger and shinier, than keratin bonds; that's exactly why they use it.

&quot;Formaldehyde preserves or fixes tissue or cells by reversibly cross-linking primary amino groups in proteins with other nearby nitrogen atoms in protein or DNA through a -CH2- linkage.&quot;

Although I don't recommend these treatments in general, I will say that the professional haircare industry has come out with one or two genuinely formaldehyde-free BKT's within the past year, so do your research, find out what's safe, and that's the way it's done. ;)",Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy Organix 30 Day Smoothing Treatment
2011-08,3.0,"To all those saying there aren't any warnings about the color changing:


&quot;It is recommended that a strand test, in a discreet area, be performed prior to application, especially if you have light colored or chemically treated hair.  In isolated circumstances, some may experience a discoloration of the hair.&quot;


Straight from their website: http://www.organixhair.com/content/bkt-30-day-smoothing-treatment-instructions


I'm pretty sure it's on the box too but I'd have to double check since I don't have the packaging sitting in front of me.


Anyway, to my review. I'll have to update this since it hasn't even been a full 24 hours yet. The process while easy was time consuming. I have hair that is fairly fine but THICK (so it looks normal but really there's a lot of it). I can't do a thing with it unless I spend an hour or more blow drying, flat ironing or curling.... which I hate and rarely do. Otherwise, it just kind does it's own thing, it has a wave but it's not well defined, it goes to about the back of my bra strap (so decently long).... A lot of times I don't even brush it since that just makes it worse. Every once in a while I'll randomly get awesome sexy bed head hair but that's pretty rare. 


I started kind of late at night and it took about 3 hours total. And I know I WAY over saturated my hair by accident. Took FOREVER to blow dry and now it feels a little on the icky side (although my coworker says it looks perfectly fine). I used my T3 hairdryer and my Chi falt iron, I think my Chi only goes up to 350 but my hair is very straight at the moment but I am counting downt the hours until I can wash it. 


In a couple of weeks when I have a better idea I'll update this review.

2011-08,2.0,"WARRNING STRIPPED COLOR FROM HAIR!!!!!!  I had colored my hair a couple of weeks ago with Garnier Fructis Herbashine #426 Deep Burgundy. It was a very pretty dark shiny color. Before that I had a med chestnut color with light caramel highlights. I decided to try this last night. I washed my hair with the clarifying shampoo twice let it air dry for a bit then applied the straighting product all seemed well although I do think I may have used a bit much, but I have long thick hair &amp; wanted to make sure to get it all covered. When I started to blow dry it felt super coated &amp; waxy I thought I would never get it dry, it did dry after awhile, but felt so sticky &amp; gross. I noticed then it looked a bit lighter I could see my old highlights a bit but nothing to drastic. I thought maybe the clarifying shampoo removed some of the color. Then I started straighting it as soon as I did the first pass with the straightener  I was SHOCKED to see the coloring lighting right in front of my eyes!!!!!! It turned a light brassy color. I almost ran in &amp; washed it out from my hair right then, but I didn't know what to do. I now had this one section of hair that was bone straight &amp; light &amp; the rest still curly &amp; dark. After a lot of hand ringing I decided to finish the process. Its now the second day &amp; my hair is super straight but it feels so nasty I cant wait to wash it out. All the dark color that was in my hair is gone. Its now back to the highlighted look but even lighter than it originally was &amp; brassy.

2018-08,4.0,"I live by the Mediterranean, which means my dyed and generally tortured hair can get severely parched both because of the sea and the sun during summer. This literally saved my hair at a time when I thought my would break into pieces because of dryness and the natural oils I was experimenting with at the time did not help. But I used the whole tube on my coarse, shoulder length hair and waited for two hours. The result was happy, hydrated, rescued hair. Unfortunately, it has a chemically, swimming pool smell that probably got amplified when I used the whole tube. It triggered my migraine - which is not usually triggered by smells- and that's the only reason why I will not purchase again. Otherwise it would be my HG moisturizing treatment.

It did look to be a little creamier, and not as thick and waxy, as the regular Sea Mineral conditioner, so I bought it. However, even using a pea sized amount on the ends of my fine/ wavy hair made it feel weighed down and gross. I paired it with a cleansing shampoo (Prell), and rinsed really well, but my hair still felt coated, yet it had surface frizz? The scent is a beachy/ sea salt/ ocean smell. It reminds me a little of the old Revlon Aqumarine, which had been discontinued. Unfortunately, this is just way too heavy for my hair. It costs around $9.",Sea Mineral Moisture Surge Treatment
2015-08,3.0,"I just wrote reviews for the shampoo and conditioner from this same Organix line, and about my disappointment with both products and Organix in general. Unfortunately, I have equally few good things to say about this deep conditioning treatment.

It smells great and it's definitely more conditioning than the regular conditioner in this same line of products--I would not repurchase the regular conditioner again, ever. This one has almost exactly the same ingredients and in the 2 months I was interchanging this with the regular conditioner, I noticed on washes with the deep conditioner my hair stayed moisturized and controlled better over the 2-3 days until the next wash.

Unfortunately, the Sea Mineral Moisture line seems to promise to take care of split ends, which it didn't for me. If it weren't for this deep conditioner, I think the split ends would have been worse and my strands would have been parched.

I appreciate that it's a lightweight treatment that didn't weigh my hair down or make it look greasy, and my hair did seem a little less frizzy/unmanageable after I used it, but it just doesn't have much of a rich/luxurious/moisturizing texture.

Having loved the Sea Mineral Shampoo and Conditioner, I thought I'd give this a try since I've been heat styling more often and my ends are a little dry.

After shampooing like normal, I applied this from ear-level down to my ends, concentrating on the ends. I left it in for about 10 minutes while I shaved my legs and scrubbed the rest of my body. 

It isn't very thick at all and almost has the texture of just regular shampoo.

When I went to rinse it out, it felt as though there wasn't even any product in my hair! Like I never applied this deep conditioner at all. It was really odd. 

After every use, I really didn't notice any improvement in my hair. It actually felt less hydrated than when I would use the regular Sea Mineral conditioner. 

I say save your $6 and use it to purchase the regular Sea Mineral conditioner instead, because that stuff is pretty awesome.

I saw some videos on YouTube about this being good for co-washing, so perhaps it works well for that purpose. But if you're looking for something to truly moisturize, repair and deep condition, this isn't it.

It's not a conditioner, folks, don't expect miracles from this if all you need is moisture. My hair is fairly protein sensitive, which means if I use too much or too often, my hair would seem dry and brittle. In fact, I wouldn't use it at all except I recently went light blonde from pitch black(dyed). 

Anyway, I paid $10 CAN for this, which is fair, I think. A little goes pretty far, it's fairly liquid so it really gets at all your lengths. Smells okay, smell doesn't last. The packaging is good, flip top and stands up easily. 

So, I can tell when my hair needs a little protein, after a week or two, it gets REALLY soft, like, a little gummy feeling when wet. I use a clarifying shampoo first, make sure most of the water is squeezed out well, and leave this in for 3-5 minutes. Rinse this really well, the first time I used it I was surprised at how curly my 2b hair was after air drying. The residue from not rinsing well enough left it a little crunchy, weird. But nice! When rinsed out well, I can tell my hair is strengthened and thickened even. More body and waves.

2018-08,4.0,"Yes this smells somewhat odd, a bit like bug spray but it does help keep my straightened hair straight, despite living in humid-land. I find it's excellent at taming any flyaways and also preventing frizz on all but the most excessive days of summer. At $8.99 for 8oz (Ulta) it's pretty good value too. However, it is very alcohol and artificial ingredients-heavy so I try not to use it too often, keeping just to special occasions or on days when I'm not using Bumble &amp; Bumble's Surf Spray or Thickening spray.

2018-08,5.0,"I never really paid much attention to hair fallout, as it is normal to lose some hairs every day.  That all changed when I found a bald spot one day while brushing my hair.  Turns out I have an autoimmune disorder called alopecia areata, for which I now receive injections directly into the bald spots to coax the follicles into growing hair.  I started checking out the rest of my hair and discovered some thinning around the hairline, kind of like a receding hairline, so started a search for hair products that might help and found the OGX Fight Fallout shampoo and conditioner.  I've been using it for a couple of months now.  It doesn't do a thing for the alopecia areata, but I wasn't expecting it to.  However, I am noticing some tiny hairs growing along my hairline where the hair appeared to be receding.  I can't say for sure that these products are causing the regrowth but maybe they are.  The alopecia treatment is nowhere near the hairline.

The shampoo is very nice, lathers fairly well and has a fresh minty smell which disappears quickly after rinsing.  The conditioner seems light weight and rinses well.  In the past I always just conditioned the ends, but since the ingredients won't do any good on the ends I am now conditioning right up to the roots, especially along the hairline, with no greasy effects at all.  My hair feels soft and full after drying, which is a bonus when I'm worried about the bald spots showing.  Some days I have used a different shampoo and I noticed my hair has less volume.  

Overall, this is a great shampoo and it probably is helping with the fallout.  I'll keep purchasing.",Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine
2017-08,5.0,"I have both the shampoo and the conditioner in this line, but not the leave-in treatment. (The leave-in, by my estimation, seems to have many of the same ingredients that the Pantene Age-Defy and the Clairol Hair Food equivalents had, though the leave-in for the Organix might have saw palmetto extract, so I may try it once I use up my Hair Food.) 

I bought the Organix right after I'd gotten a major haircut. Pre-haircut, my color-treated hair -- which is fine, frizzy and dry and hit around my shoulders -- was flat and shedding a lot. I'd be super annoyed washing my hair and seeing tons of long strands coming out. I wasn't sure if it was the normal amount of shed, though it seemed high to me, especially since it was happening every time I shampooed or simply brushed my hair.

So I went and did a 	major chop, kind of a pixie with more height at the crown. With the new hair I thought I'd try a new shampoo and see if I could revive my locks. This product, with the niacin and caffeine, alpha-hydroxy acids, plus saw palmetto extract, has ingredients that sound promising for boosting hair growth and reducing thinning and shedding. Sold.

I've used it for about a month. It's not a long enough time to really notice if I have new hair growth, but I like what is happening.

The first time I used it in shower I wasn't super thrilled with the formula. I didn't hate it, but didn't love it either. It lathers well, but not super soapy the way some other shampoos can. I don't mind that because I usually go for sulfate-free formulas. If I do the rinse and repeat trick it foams up more in round two, however. The formula smells faintly minty and there's a tiny bit of minty tingle on the scalp. Some other minty shampoos I've tried in the past I've hated because my hair would be dry and stripped feeling, so I thought I would hate this. But I don't. I've grown quite fond of it. This doesn't leave my hair feeling stripped, but it feels clean and not coated either. The conditioner is mild. It's also a tiny bit minty, but it's not heavy in some fatty way. It coats my hair and leaves it feeling treated without feeling coated or super slippery. 

I've not used this exclusively in the last month, but I'm shampooing mostly every other day -- compared to twice or even once a week, pre-hair cut -- and use this at least twice a week. 

Since adding this to my rotation I've noticed a few things that I like:

1. I am shedding less hair in-shower and outside. In fact the last time I used a regular shampoo and conditioner I noticed a lot of shedding both during the wash and the following day. As soon as I returned to the Organix, it slowed or stopped enough where I didn't notice the shedding.

2. My hair dries with a lot more bounce and volume after using this duo. Other shampoos and conditioners make my short hair fall a lot flatter, but when I use this again it has a nice fluff to it that works well with just a tiny bit of styling product for a bit of hold and/or definition.

3. While I can't say I see any real hair growth or reduction in thinning, it does seem like there's a bit more hair. I'm not sure if the formula adds volume or maybe I'm getting a few new hairs, but I'll take it.

This is a definite buy-again product for me. I'm not sure I'd like it if I had long hair, but for my shorter hair it works really well and I like the boost in bounce and volume it gives me, paired with less shedding.

One note: The price of this product varies wildly. At your corner drug store it can be somewhere around $8, but if you visit Target, Harmon's (or the beauty department in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond's that have one) or Kroger, you can find it for a couple dollars less. Kroger had it on sale for $5 a bottle at one point, in fact. I'd gladly pay $8 a bottle for this, but who doesn't love a bargain?",Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine
2017-08,5.0,"My hair started falling out in greater-than-normal amounts due to stress, I'm pretty sure. Between school and work, I haven't figured out a way to manage my stress and anxiety yet. I'm 23 now but noticed increased fall-out when I was still 22. We're talking more than just the ordinary clumps in the shower. There was hair everywhere and I was noticing loose hair that had fallen out of my head and onto my arms constantly. I was getting pretty scared watching my long thick hair fall out and noticing that my ponytail was getting narrower. I internet surfed for a while and came across this shampoo and conditioner and decided to give it a try.
The price was higher and the bottles were smaller than what I was used to. I wasn't super keen on spending that much on shampoo and conditioner but I was more scared about losing hair so I bought them anyways.
Let me tell you, they were well worth the money. I wanted the product to last a long time so I started off using much less product than I usually use. I heard that you only really need shampoo for your roots and conditioner for your ends (for most hair types) so that's what I did. I'm probably going to need to buy more after using it for three months; that lasted a lot longer than I thought they would.
How it feels: The shampoo doesn't lather as much as I like but that's because I've got it in my head that more lather = better cleaning but I know that's not necessarily true. I make sure my hair is super wet before using the shampoo so that works pretty well and I still get a little lather. Rinsing it out feels amazing and even before using conditioner my hair is noticeably smoother and softer. The conditioner isn't as smooth/creamy as some conditioners I've used but otherwise it feels pretty normal. The conditioner doesn't de-tangle as much as I'd like as I rinse it out but when I comb it out after when it's damp (always use a wide tooth comb when damp) it doesn't feel tangly at all anymore.
How it smells: I know some users don't like the smell but I love it. I somehow thought it would smell like a mix of mint and coffee because of the caffeine in it but it's just a strong sweet minty smell, which I love.
What it did: It definitely noticeably decreased the amount of hair falling out. There's no way of quantifying how much it stopped but it definitely feels like it's back down to a normal healthy amount of hair fall-out. I started noticing a difference by two weeks of use. My hair has also never felt healthier or been shinier before. I know some less high-end shampoos/conditioners are guilty of coating your hair with waxy stuff to make your hair feel smoother and look shinier (according to my very knowledgeable hair stylist) and my old shampoo/conditioner must have been doing that too to some extent because switching to this product has drastically changed how my hair looks and feels. It doesn't feel fake anymore but more real, if that make sense. And SO SHINY. My hair was decently healthy before since I don't use any heat on my hair but this product was a game-changer. My hair feels much more natural and it has also stopped falling out at an unhealthy rate so I'm happy.
Some users say this product dried their hair out. I have no idea if this product dries my hair since I also use this brand's argan oil on my hair ends before I let it air dry. I have not noticed my hair feeling dry at all though but that could be due to the argan oil.",Anti-hair fallout Niacin3 & Caffeine

I've noticed no more fall out as well.  Can't tell if any new hairs are growing in but not losing any was my main concern for now. I only wash my hair 2x a week and only condition the res of the days.  I have found in this short time that when it's time to rewash my hair, it really didn't need it.  My hair has been super shiny since starting this too.  Love the smell as well.  I've used Nioxin before and it's dried out my hair and made it unmanageable.  I'm sticking with this for now.

2018-08,1.0,"This conditioner gave me the worst reaction I've ever had to any conditioner, ever, and it wasn't even an allergic reaction. Ok, so this is gross but-it gave me CYSTIC ACNE on my SCALP. I never get cystic acne anywhere, and never ever break out on my scalp. I didn't even think that could really happen, but this left me with a big, painful (not itchy so I know it's not an allergy) cyst on my scalp that took forever to go away. I think it's either because of the strong perfumey fragrance or because it's filled with silicones. I actually had the &quot;extra strength&quot; version-I think that's what it's called-which is like the regular one but I think has more silicones, but although I avoid excess silicones in hair products it's just because they weigh down my waves, I've never broken out from them even on my face/hairline. But even if this didn't break me out, it still fails in other departments too. It's very heavy and slick feeling but it's one of those conditioners that never actually absorbs into your hair, it just coats it, so I was left with weighed down, coated and dull feeling/looking hair but it was still super dry! The only good thing about this at all is the scent, and the bottle is a pretty color but even the bottle is annoying lol. It's bulky, falls over a lot in the shower, and the cap can get stuck and become hard to flip open when your hands are wet. This goes for all OGX products, cute packaging but not at all utilitarian.

This conditioner somehow made my hair crazy tangled in the shower, every time i used it. There was no way I could run my fingers through my hair wet (under the water still) like you should with a conditioner. I tried to use this multiple times, same issue every time. I dont even know how this could have hypothetically left my hair when dry... it could have had amazing results, but I'll never know because I literally couldn't bring myself to step out of the shower with my hair in that tangled mess. I had to follow up every time with another conditioner (which regardless of whichever one I used, fixed the tangled mess this OGX one left my hair in), so I ultimately threw this away.

The smell is nice and not overpowering

2015-08,4.0,"I have been trying out and testing many different brands of dry oils ever since falling in love with ION's Keratin Dry Oil Mist. Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil is definitely the lightest dry oil I've found on the market yet. I have thick hair (quantity) but it's fine (texture). This dry oil moisturizes without weighing my hair down. Those of you with coarse hair might want to steer clear of it &amp; opt for something a bit heavier/greasier. 

The ingredient list is very simple. I was a bit concerned about C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate being on the list. I ALWAYS research ingredient lists before purchasing. It is definitely important to learn the science behind ingredients. After a bit of googling, I learned that C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate is simply an emulsifier/thickener agent. The reason I was so suspicious of it is because this dry oil is litterally dry. It is VERY light weight and dissappears quickly. Yes it gives my hair shine, and yes it moisturizes my hair. But after a minute of applying, I can't feel it on the surface on my hair. Rubbing alcohol shoved into cheap products tends to do that. It acts as a drying agent to make formulas more lightweight. But again, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate is not cleverly disguised isopropyl alcohol........so no worries there. 

Nothing else on the ingredient list concerned me. There's a lot of silicone in this to give the hair slip, followed by Argan oil and a few more silicones. Parfum is last on the list thankfully. 

I'll opt for this on days I cowash. NO it's not my favorite dry oil, however I definitely would prefer a dry oil be a tad too light than a tad too heavy. ",Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil spray

I absolutely love this product. I was on the hunt for a good dry oil, since all of my many oils are in a pump. I don't mind it too much, but I much prefer the spray bottle.

And so much cheaper. I see the Moroccanoil one at 60.00$+ sometimes, and to me, it's a lot for an oil.

How I use it: I don't spray it directly on my head. I spray one spray, which is enough, on the palm of my hand, rub my hands together and but it on my hair. I don't use it on my scalp, since we have natural oils there. 

Many people wonder why their ends are dry and less healthy than the top of their head. The answer to that is that the hair gets it's nutriment and all the good stuff from the blood. When you have longer hair, all those oils and nutriment don't get to the end of your hair. That is why we do not need to put oils on the top of our head and why are ends are usually less healthy than the top.

The pros of this product are the price, it smells great, and will leave a nice sheen to your hair. The cons of this product are that it doesn't really calm frizz and you have to be very light with it otherwise you'll look greasy. As for healing split ends? Rubbish. The only way to get rid of split ends are to cut them off.

This one is a keeper. I have fine shoulder length colored hair and wash/dry/style it daily, so my ends tend to get dry and split. This dry oil helps smooth the roughness of my ends and leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable. It's weightless and doesn't start to become greasy during the day, unlike a lot of the other products I tried. I've seen some reviewers complain that the spray packaging tends to make a mess, but I just spray three pumps into my palm, rub together and then smooth through my hair, concentrating on the ends I feel that this distributes it  more evenly than just spraying it on anyway. It also smells good :) The price is great (got it on sale at CVS for $5.49, and had additional coupons). I do not think that this would work very well for people with coarse, thick or very damaged hair (they make other products under this line that penetrate more and are more intensive-the labeling is pretty clear about what hair type each product is for).

It's best use is for days I pull my hair in a ponytail and there's a halo of frizz sticking out, this oil does an awesome job smoothing it out &amp; adds great shine! IMO it's non-oily, but keep in mind I have coarse/frizzy hair that needs all the moisture it can get. I won't repurchase as it's not for daily use and the bottle will last me a long time.

2013-08,5.0,"I have had dull (dull, dull, dull!!!), lifeless hair for as long as I can remember.  I have a few greys so I touch up my roots about every 2 months.  The color I use matches my hair perfectly and lets my natural highlights (dark brown with reddish highlights) show through...BUT...over the past year or so my whole head started to have that dead, over-dyed, dull look.

I had tried shine sprays, leave-in conditioners and other various products to try and bring some life back to my hair.  I even started trying to wash my short, fine, thin hair every 3 days.  What I ended up with was a greasy scalp, dry ends and a dull build-up.

In a desperate moment as I was getting ready for another root touch-up I grabbed this off the store shelf.  I am sooooooo glad I did.  After I rinsed the color off my hair and conditioned I sprayed a little of this oil onto my hand and worked it through my wet hair.  After I blew it dry my hair was really shiny.  Not oily greasy looking shiny, but natural shiny.  After it was dry I misted my head with it so I could run my fingers through and calm the fly-aways.  My hair is soft and looks nothing short of amazing.  

When I woke up the next morning I gave my head another mist before I brushed it out.  This oil is so light it sinks right in.  No oily residue or greasy spots...just style and shine.

It comes in a nice pump bottle and the pump reaches all the way to the bottom so it appears as though I will be able to use every drop. It has a light, pleasant musky scent that is so mild it doesn't &quot;follow me&quot;  around. I think I've found a winner!!!  If anything changes I will certainly post.

EDIT:  It's been three days I haven't washed my hair yet (because it has been so dry lately I have been trying to go a few days between washes).  With as fine as my hair is the hair near my scalp usually gets really flat oily and dirty looking by day 3...I have been giving my hair a mist every morning and the weird thing is it still looks freshly washed and it still smells fine.  It feels soft and silky.  My hair literally seems to soak this stuff up and loves every minute of it!

-I usually don't spray product directly onto my hair because I don't want it to get greasy. I like the spray nozzle on this; it sprays like a mist and if I hold it far back enough (8in) I can spray directly onto my hair.

-It's not terribly moisturizing but I like that it's lightweight and will continue to use it and asses its effects later.

It wasn't horrible but it wasn't good enough to continue using. since my original review I've been using One and Only's argan oil spray treament as that stuff is AMAZING. It's also inexpensive and I don't see the point in using this product when I've found something that's a million times better.

2013-08,3.0," Organix calls their Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil an &quot;exotic, precious formula of Moroccan Argan Oil spray that instantly infuses the hair with a sheer veil of shine, giving color and highlights a multifaceted glow while it mends split ends and tames fly away frizzies. This exotic, precious formula of Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Spray instantly heals split ends, creating soft, frizz free perfection while protecting your hair from harmful styling heat and UV damage, giving a smooth, glossy shine.&quot; Whoa there Organix, healing split ends? I don't think so. I'm a pretty big fan of hair oils, as most of yinz know, so I was very excited to try a dry oil. Unlike the Organix Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Treatment, the Weightless Healing Dry Oil actually contains a decent amount of Argan Oil, though not enough to really be considered &quot;exotic and precious.&quot; I bought my 118ml (4 fl oz) bottle at Ulta for $6.99, which I think is a very fair price. Organix, ironically, is not an organic brand, but they are cruelty free. This hair oil was made in America. Organix products are available at drugstores and mass retailers around the world. 
 Organix Moroccan Argan Weightless Healing Dry Oil comes in a clear, recyclable plastic bottle topped with a spritzer. I love that this oil is in spray form, its so much less messy and infinitely more convenient to use. Good thinkin' Organix. The front label features the product name, product description, and Organix logo. The back of the bottle offers the ingredients, as well as instructions in both English and French. Big fan of the packaging, I wish more hair oils were in spray form. 
 I've tried Josie Maran's 100% Pure Argan Oil for my hair, and found it to be too much, and I don't find Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil to be enough. I just don't think Argan Oil and my hair get along. What I use the Weightless Healing Dry Oil for is to aid in brushing my hair. I spritz it three or so times on my brush, per section, to help my brush glide through my thick hair, spreading the oil evenly and kinda helping to detangle. Organix Weightless Healing Dry Oil gives my hair a healthy sheen without appearing greasy (unless I get it in my bangs, it makes them look pretty greasy and gross). As for the claims that this oil will heal split ends? Totes untrue, that isn't possible. I really hope that brands stop making that claim soon, I feel like its common knowledge that the only cure for split ends is a hair cut. It just makes any brand that claims their products are split end menders look silly, at least in my eyes. I want to mention the feel of this oil, it really is &quot;dry&quot; as the name would imply, giving it a very interesting texture. Just like the Organix Intense Moisturizing Treatment, the Weightless Healing Dry Oil has a sexy, musky scent that really lasts in the hair. 
Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Weightless Healing Dry Oil is nice for adding a healthy sheen and sexy scent to the hair, but don't expect any dramatic results. I wouldn't repurchase this product and only recommend it for those with dry, dull looking hair. If you're looking for a serious hair oil treatment, I'd steer you in the direction of pure Pequi or Bhringraj oils, or perhaps one of Organix' hair masks.

- I thoroughly enjoyed using this moroccon oil spray. I love that it's in a spray bottle, I've never come across moroccon oil treatment in the form of a spray.
- the price point of approx. $8-9 CAD at wal-mart is a great price compared to salon products that I've used in the past.

**Edit** Ok, WHY did I think this had cocoa and shea in it!? Online it's saying it's not. Now I'm wondering if I read it wrong or there are two versions? Would have been cool. Either way it worked for me when I tried it.
*****OK! I'm not crazy. I went to the store and it DOES have those ingredients. Idk why all the sites do not list them, so maybe there are older and newer formulas. Just be aware of what works with your hair because I know my hair responds well to those and less so to argan. So good to know!!

Update: I never ended up buying this, but I tried a few Organix and L'oreals of similar types and they all were drying and not so great.

I sprayed all the times I used it (I wasn't very economical but definitely did not weigh my hand.) I might try retouching with my palms as the retouch spraying made the tresses a bit oily - not much.

I assumed this would be a bit lighter than the Organix Argan oil that comes in a little bottle, since this is a spray.  I have to guess that I did not use more spray than the normal amount of oil that I would normally use.  [I've been using the oil in the bottle for about a month or so, mixing it with my regular gel (L'Oreal Melting gel) and getting incredible results- my thick, wavy, somewhat frizz-prone hair has been looking amazing with that combo.]  In any event, it was obviously too much.  At first I noticed that it was really hard to dry my hair.  It was taking way too long.  Then I noticed that it actually was dry but just looked wet.  Ugh.  This left my hair insanely stringy and greasy.  Much dirtier looking than two day old hair.  Note that my hair is generally dry-normal and can soak up plenty of product without a problem usually.

I've been using this every day since I bought it about three weeks ago. It's less than $9 at Ulta, and you can find it with the other Organix argan products on the drugstore side. The mist is so fine and the oil is very dry (which is a good thing), so it instantly absorbs into hair instead of sitting on top of it. I have thick wavy/curly hair and it makes it so much softer. You get a ton of shine that isn't greasy feeling. I was using Alterna Bamboo Kendi Oil spray, but it's $24. This is the best affordable oil spray that I've ever found. Update: Using too much will coat the hair and give an oily look, so make sure you spray it on evenly. Mine has never stopped up or sprayed unevenly, and it's half gone. I've had it for months and use it every day, so a bottle could last more than 3-4 months with regular use. If you use it along with other products with oils or silicones, they won't mix right and you'll be unhappy with the results.

My favorite thing is that this spray will only accentuate wavy hair, not get rid of them completely.
Pros: pleasant coconut scents; very light on the hair; not oily (which is very important if you sleep with wet hair); good price especially on discount; keeps the waves; makes hair softer;
Cons: pump/spray thing broke down ",Weightless hydration oil mist

2016-08,5.0,"I have fairly crappy hair. Midlength, lots of it, slightly thick, damaged, and wavy in some areas, straight in others. Even worse, I have zero patience to deal with styling it. Blowouts using a round brush? Sorry, not going to happen. Usually I just throw on some sea salt spray and hope I look beachy, not unkempt. (spoiler, usually end up looking like my hair is a greasy shapeless rats nest). I have never been overly impressed with Organix, the shampoos and conditioners are both drying and not really cleansing. Anyway, I saw reviews and needed a cheap smoothing styler that does not weigh my hair down. This does a really good job of keeping my hair soft and shiny, and I swear it actually cuts down on my drying time. It helps my hair look polished and not really poofy and frizzy if I do blow dry without a brush.

2016-08,4.0,"Background: I have thin-ish hair that borders between &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot;. I have naturally frizzy hair that about one in every ten asian girls have. To deal with this, I get my hair straight-permed on an almost yearly basis. However, the ends of my hair are quite damaged and gets very frizzy during the humid months.

I find that this product is GREAT for people with fine hair who have slightly damaged or rough-feeling split ends and such. As the bottle's description says, it's a LIGHT HYDRATION SPRAY. It's not for your entire hair, just for areas that need JUST A BIT of extra hydration. In fact I apply a different hair oil before applying this product, as it's good for giving just an extra boost to a concentrated area without making it feel TOO oily.

TO RECAP
This product is for:
 - an extra boost of hydration without making the hair too oily
 - areas like split, damaged ends
 - fine, thin, moderate hair
 - making frizzy hair feel soft and healthy

This isn't for:
 - applying to the entire length of your hair
 - people with naturally curly or overly frizzy hair (this product is too light for that)",Weightless hydration oil mist
2015-08,5.0,"I recently tried the Organix coconut milk line . My husband purchased the 25.4 oz shampoo and conditioner and the organix coconut oil weightless hydration spray.I purchased the Organix anti breakage serum at CVS it was on sale . I love how these products work together . My hair has a little wave to it and when I use these products together I feel like I can let my hair air dry and it looks shiny , it smells nice and it is strong and not damaged. This line of Organix is by far my favorite and when I flat iron my hair it stays shiny , strong and bouncy for days. So honestly if I flat iron my hair it can last until I wash it again yes I'm not kidding it's that incredible. It is affordable for what you get. You get products that are animal cruelty free, the packaging is made from recycled materials and the products are sulfate free. These products are readily available at drugstores, supermarkets, Wal-Mart, Target, Harmon , ULTA. I think that Harmon has the best lowest prices everyday. I would like to try the Organix Macadamia one but I honestly love the Organix coconut milk one so much I don't see myself using anything else for a while. The instructions say to spray on towel dried hair which I do but I also use it on dry hair and I use it as a heat protectant before I flat iron my hair with all of those uses it is bargain at $5.99 at Harmon for 4oz . A little goes a long way . Also it has that nice coconut smell and tames those flyaway hairs .
I would definitely recommend this if you have wavy thick or straight thick hair for strong, shiny beautiful hair.",Weightless hydration oil mist

The tropical fragrance goes well with the coconut water shampoo, adding a little shine over my regular creams/serums. It's very light so don't expect to use it without conditioner. It just gives you that little added sheen which makes hair look healthy and soft.
The fragrance is faint enough to not compete with a body spray, but you can still catch hints of it throughout the day. The best part is, your hair won't be oily by the end of the day.",Weightless hydration oil mist
2015-08,2.0,"The oil smells very nice light and pleasant. However, I do not think this is a long lasting hydrating oil you are better off mixing coconut oil and water in a spray bottle for better results. Its like spraying water and that is more hydrating.   This may be because of the texture of my hair it is very coarse  so this product may work for someone with  less course or thinner hair. The packaging is cute but I do believe this product does not have the powerful ingredients it once had when it first came out. I do not use this on my natural hair however, I use it on my virgin hair extensions. I would not recommend this product for the price it is too expensive for the lack of results that you get. I would suggest to only purchase this product if you are going out of town and need something a little more on the natural side but because of the price I don't recommend it. A few years ago I fell in love with this product because it gave my extensions wonderful results. I cannot use this product for my hair because it is not 100% natural and my hair doesn't react to it well. This is still  a drugstore brand and you do get what you pay for.",Weightless hydration oil mist

I love that the scent is relatively noticable but not overpowering. I do notice, though, that the pump part can be a little difficult to use and, due to the packaging and the size, I usually have to use two hands to use it. If you stick your hands in your hair, you'll likely get some product on your hands and it makes the bottle kind of slippery. Once in, though, my hair feels soft and smooth and just a little bit of shine (not greasy looking though!) It's alright for the price.

I cannot recommend this highly enough. I have their conditioner which is also excellent.
I'd been using oils that cost £30 plus from various department stores and this is the best I've found. I used a little too much but have adjusted amounts for my hair length ( very long )
Buy it! Everyone has different hair, even within the spectrum of color, condition et cetera but, I really think this is perfect and with summer here, I'm so glad I have this!

While this doesn't help detangle per se, it gives my damaged ends that moisture they need. I've tried the coconut milk anti-breakage serum but even half a pump is waaay too much for my thin locks. This stuff is great cause I can spray it (lightly) all over and my hair feels super soft.

Worked well for blow drying, used as directed (pre-dry spray and then as finishing spray). Hair in general looked less frizzy and ends looked less dry.

CONS:
Did not last. Dry and frizzy a few hours later and worse after sleeping on it (usually my hair is less frizzy after sleep). 
Did not really hydrate my hair.
Difficult to use packaging. Had to wash hands repeatedly throughout use to keep bottle from slipping and sliding.

This might work great for someone with hair that is not as dry and damaged as mine, or that lives in a less humid environment.

I purchased the plain coconut, which has a warm, &quot;foody&quot; coconut smell. These are basically lightweight, liquidy spray on serums (a mixture of silicones, oils and fragrance). I spray on my hand, rub to distribute, then lightly work through my dry hair. Oils/ serums on my fine hair when wet make it feel gross (unless it's hot &amp; humid out, then my hair can handle it) but a little on dry hair tames the frizzies &amp; adds shine. This is like a liquidy serum, not very oily at all. If you want more of a liquidy-oil formulated for fine hair, I'd try the Moroccan Argan oil light for fine brittle hair.

I was delighted to find it smells the same but the spray was a much lighter formula and flowed in the bottle like liquid instead of the thicker serum. I looked on makeup alley on my phone for any reviews there wasn't any. :( so I quickly tested it. (shame on me I know) The smell is so lovely if you like coconuts. And the shine is immediate. It soften my hair a bit without that gross &quot;wash me&quot; feeling, it didn't pull my curls down or make my hair look dirty. So it came home with me.

Like most sulphate-free shampoos, I need to shampoo and rinse 2-3 times in the shower to get my oily scalp squeaky clean, so it's not the most budget-friendly option out there. The delicate flowery smell was lovely though and when used with the tsubaki conditioner, after a week of daily use it really did feel softer overall and my boyfriend noticed without me asking.

However, I've had great experience with Tsubaki oil in Shiseido hair care so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. The entire Head Spa gold series lived for almost two years in my shower because for some reason Japanese hair care is very rich so little goes a long way.

2018-08,5.0,"I am a big fans of OGX products/line. However, these products are so hard to find in Malaysia and the easiest way, is to buy online from USA or from Singapore. I have so far not being disappointed by this brand. This Kukui Oil comes in a plastic bottle with a printed description of the product and it promises to give &quot;good hair day&quot;. They put the words in open inverted commas, which I would take it as a temporary method, by giving you shiny and glossy look and make you feel happy that your hair is getting better and more presentable. But I believe in long term, it will definitely give benefits to my hair. 
The oil has a slightly golden caramel colour with a very pleasant nutty smell. It might smell quite sweet and lovely but it vanishes after I apply it to my hair. So not a big worry of this smell overpowers my perfume or shampoo. The cap of the plastic bottle is actually very tight and closes very well to prevent leakage. It does not only close the spray bottle but also 'click' to make it close better and more secure. I have no issue on its packaging or bottle at all. 
I am quite skeptical of this product at first because it does not give me an anti-frizz effect to my hair but it 'poofs' my hair to make it look worse than before application and alot frizzier! I ended up putting this product aside and not using it for quite sometime. After I switch to another shampoo and conditioner, I somehow get back to this oil by holding a belief that, it should not perform in that manner and I shall give it a second chance.
Luckily I give it a second chance and try it again and this time, maybe partly is because of the shampoo and conditioner I use, it really gives me &quot;good hair day&quot; and almost no frizz after I use it together with my flat iron. The oil is so light that I do not have to worry it overweighs my hair and makes it oily and dirty. I surely has no problem of reapply it the next day.

This does not come in a spray bottle, but a 3.3 ounce bottle that you pour into your hand. This can get messy &amp; drippy since this is a liquidy oil/ silicone combo. My hair is fine &amp; wavy with a tendency to get dry &amp; frizzy in certain weather conditions (heat &amp; humidity), and I heard the regular version of this is heavier, and thought it might be too much for my fine hair. I've been using this on dry hair, and it does have a tendency to give a &quot;wet&quot; look since it's oilier than the spray on serums, so be careful since this does not absorb on dry hair quite as well as the spray on serums. This is what I wanted, though, and I'm pleased with this lighter version for fine hair. It moisturizers my hair nicely and improves it's appearance.

2015-08,4.0,It smells bubblegummy/fruity to me. It was my first Organix product. I fell in love. It has good slip and leaves dry hair feeling soft. I can get three co-washes before need to shampoo.,Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner
2014-08,1.0,"This conditioner left so much residue in my hair I had to wash it again and really scrub to get it all out. It smells great but that's it. I have somewhat fine, color treated hair so would not recommend for anyone with a similar hair type. ",Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner
2014-08,4.0,"I bought this BOGO at Ulta. It smells wonderful and has good slip. There is a little protein in this so I have to take a break from using this daily but my hair looks shiny and feels soft after air drying. I love the macadamia conditioner more than this, but this is a close second. It does moisturize pretty decently. I like the texture it gives to my hair too. It has a creamy thick texture and is pink in color which is different.  I do have to use two squirts to feel that my hair is properly coated but my hair is never weighed down. It rinses clean and the scent lingers for a while. ",Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner
2014-08,1.0,Product was very poor at actually conditioning the hair. It was way too light of a product and felt cheap. I was using almost half a cup it seemed just to get enough to make my hair feel conditioned. I would never repurchase this product again.

It looks nice but it's impossible to tell how much product is left and you don't get a lot of it for the price(about 11$ CAD. Not bad but could be better) . It was a pretty nice conditioner, very thick and an interesting pink colour. It had lots of slip and made my hair very smooth and shiny. Unfortunately, the protein in it built up and made my hair tangly, frizzy, and brittle. I had to throw it out. Unless your hair is extremely lacking in protein, I wouldn't recommend this.

2013-08,5.0,"I had read reviews on this before buying it. I first tried the moroccon conditioner from Organix, which I HATED simply because it did not condition my hair. But i won't rant about that. 

This awapuhi repairing conditioner is what my hair has been waiting for. I am way overdue for a hair trim and color (I have super long fine asian hair). With that said, this conditioner really did help to repair my hair. It softened my hair, the strands feel stronger and healthier. It is extremely easy to blow dry my hair now. It's usually a pain to brush my damp hair, but since using this conditioner, I have no problems. I gave the price 5 stars only because I got this on sale for $6.99 CAD, when it's regular price is $9-10 CAD at shoppers drug mart!! I will be buying the awapuhi shampoo as well.

My recommendation is to try THIS conditioner out of all the other ones of the Organix line. I've tried the morocon and keratin oils and sprays, and they are only O-K.",Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Conditoner
2013-08,4.0,"I've already reviewed the shampoo in this line so I thought I'd review the conditioner too. I bought this line because I tend to leave towards using organic products and I have damaged hair that could really use some love. I do like the conditioner but I was expecting something a little different. The conditioner is quite thin which I'm not really a fan of but I leave it on for around 3 minutes while I clean the rest of my body and when I rinse it off, my hair is so soft. As someone who has bleached my entire head 5 times within the past 12 months and has dangerously unhealthy hair, I am really happy to report that I have noticed an improvement in the past month since I have been using this line. My hair is a lot softer and stronger feeling. I do tend to rotate my shampoos and conditioners so my hair doesn't get used to products so once I have flirted with a few other shampoos I will come back to this line.

It was only about 8 dollars, and it made my hair extremely soft to the touch.

I love the smell of this conditioner, and it's working okay, but just okay. Its more like a creme rinse to me than a conditioner, it's so thin &amp; watery. I have to be careful pouring it into my hands, it's so thin it'll run right through my fingers if I'm not careful. Perhaps the drugstores get a different formulation?

2012-08,4.0,"My hair is a bit thick and is naturally really wavy, and on really good hair days some loose curls form. My problem is that my hair is really frizzy, a bit of split ends, and while it doesn't feel like a haystack it doesn't feel like silk. I tried this on a whim and I definitely do not regret it. I love the smell and for me the stronger the smell the better, but I don't think that those who like their products to have a weak scent will have too much of a problem with this. My biggest issue with this product is that a little does not go a long way. My hair length is barely mid-back so I don't expect to only uses a bit of the product, but I really have to grab a hearty handful for the bottom length of my hair to feel saturated. This means that I use up a lot of product quickly, which I find to be bummer because I don't always have time to go to Target and means more money spent. Yet, I'd buy this again because my hair does feel heck of a lot softer, there is more shine, it's more manageable, and the frizz has died down a tiny bit.

2015-08,2.0,"I bought this on sale at Rexall for $8.99 CDN, so it's not exactly cheap for a drugstore product. However, I've been using it for about three weeks now. My reaction? Meh. 

My hair is curly, about a 2b/2c curl, and extremely dry...it gets frizzy very easily. My main trouble is getting my hair to cooperate with me in the morning. I usually either wash or rinse my hair after the gym every morning and then head straight to work, so I needed something to help my hair air dry into something other than a lion's mane. 

I've integrated this spray into my routine this week: I rinse or co-wash my hair, towel dry and then spray this Kukui oil spray into my hair while it's damp. Comb it out with a wide tooth comb and scrunch with TRESemmé Climate Control Mousse. 

The result? I think I might as well not use it. I find this product way too &quot;light&quot; for my thick, coarse hair. If you have dry, curly hair like mine, you're generally looking for something to give your hair moisture. This is not it.

2015-08,3.0,"Add this to the long list of OGX shampoos and conditioners that I have tried and hated.  Admittedly, this is not the worst one. The Vitamin B one ravaged my hair like no other, and this is not nearly as poor as that.  This is supposed to be nourishing, moisturizing, etc., but it did nothing of the sort.  My hair felt really dry after using (with the coordinating conditioner), but simultaneously, it didn't really feel all that clean. It doesn't matter which of the OGX shampoos I try, they all seem to have that affect on me. I'm guessing they use really cheap, harsh cleansing ingredients: why else would the products be so cheap?  (And why don't I learn?) One of the reasons I decided to give this one a go, despite my previous bad experiences with their products, was the fragrance. I thought it kind of had an interesting, high-end scent - not exotic or spicy, more of a gender-neutral maybe even slightly masculine scent. Anyway, enjoying the scent is not going to have me using this on any kind of regular basis. I might hang onto this for a deep cleansing shampoo. Also, be aware it has a very weird texture: it's literally a slow moving goo. Boderline rubbery.  It's very odd, and you almost have to PRESS it into your hair to begin shampooing. Odd and annoying. I bought the coordinating conditioner and was very equally unimpressed. Hopefully, I have finally learned my lesson on buying their products.  ",Moroccan Argan Creme Shampoo

2017-08,1.0,"This spray does not work well. In fact, straightening my hair was much more difficult than normal when using this product. 

My hair looked worse when using this spray. The results were not silky, smooth, or straight hair. Instead, my hair felt slightly coarser, less silky and looked a little chunkier than normal...kind of like second-day hair. 

It must *really* protect your hair from heat because I had to flat iron each section two or three times, whereas my hair normally flat irons straight in just one pass. What the heck?

Since I had to flat iron each section several times, it presumably introduced more heat damage than normal since it would normally take just one pass with the iron. Further, multiple passes = flatter hair. My hair definitely had less volume because of this. 

The mist didn't seem fine enough to reach every hair. I sprayed each section of hair, then used my hands to smooth it through my strands. It was very time-consuming and messy. 

What's more, my arm (and presumably my floor) got spray residue on it. Not a fan of that. 

The ingredients start off promising. It contains some beneficial oils and hydrolized keratin (a strengthening protein) but towards the end of the ingredient list is diazolidinyl urea, which is a formaldehyde releaser. I'd be willing to ignore the formaldehyde if the product actually worked well, but alas it made my hair look worse. 

I only did half my head (I have very thick, long, wavy hair so I feel this was a good sample) and stopped because I could tell it was not coming out nicely. I'll be giving the bottle away sadly. What crap. ",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray

I'm sure it's responsible for saving my hair from getting fried in the flat iron, but it doesn't improve my hair's condition as it claims.  I'm kind of just using this up mainly because I love how this product smells - like coconut cream pie!  I find myself sniffing my hair randomly throughout the day...  To be honest, I don't smell any unpleasant alcohol scent like others have mentioned, but maybe my nose is not the keenest.

The only con is because it's lightweight it stays straight for the day and I would like a product with longer results.

I've been using it for a little while now and find that it is quite good at achieving the straightening side of things, as well as making my hair look a little shinier and smelling very nice too. However for me, it isn't hydrating enough. My hair is very thick and dry so therefore requires a product that can provide moisture as well as good protection and straightening. It claims to deliver big promises on the front of the bottle, such as 'keratin proteins to help strengthen and soften the hair' &amp; 'avocado oil and cocoa butter to smooth the cuticle' but I can't say that the condition of my hair has improved dramatically nor has it become stronger or softer. I think maybe if I had fine or medium thickness hair then it would probably work better, but since I am a heat styling addict I don't think this works well for those with thick, coarse or dry hair.

The bottle was very hard to use; no matter how you grasped it, it made also pressing the sprayer down difficult.

One of the main ingredients is alcohol which is bad for the hair. I will be returning this product tomorrow.

I have had the Keratin Treatment done at my salon four times, and I am absolutely obsessed with it. I actually only bought this product because I needed a new heat protectant, and I thought this one would be perfect because I would be safe for my  Keratin treated hair. The first time I used it, I was totally amazed. It made my hair so straight and smoothed, it looked just like it does when you walk out of a salon after getting Keratin. I recommend this to everyone unless you have very fine hair, because it will weigh down your hair and take away all volume. My only complaint is the bottle. The bottle is an odd, wide shape so it makes spraying with one hand difficult. Other than that it is to die for.",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray

2011-08,5.0,"I've used a few different flat iron/heat protectant sprays and I like this one the best. I've tried Pantene's heat protectant spray for medium-thick hair, Rusk's flat iron spray, and Ion's flat iron spray and none leave my hair nearly as soft or frizz-free as this one. I also love the scent of the product and the packaging is nice. The bottle is small and it gives an even spray which makes it superior to Pantene's formua which sprays unevenly and is sticky in consistency. This is perhaps a little expensive for a drugstore brand. I think I got mine on sale at Target for $6, it's usually like $7-$8 and it's not a ton of formula either but I think for the results it is worth it. I will definitely buy this product again and I look forward to trying out the shampoos and conditioners by this brand in the future.",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray

2011-08,2.0,So I tried this after reading the positive reviews on here and after trying the John Frieda Frizz-Ease heat guard spray that did nothing for my hair.  This doesn't work either.  Smells good though.  I think it may have something to do with the fact that when I put anything wet on my hair after I've dried it my hair just curls up.  Not sure though.  Sooo onto the next thing.  I believe I need to go with an Aveda product since that's what my stylist uses and my hair comes out sooo straight.,Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray
2011-08,2.0,"I had such high hopes for this product!  Sadly it did nothing for my hair.  I also HATE the design of the bottle which makes it very difficult to spray product in your hair.  No shine, no bouncy, no nothing.  Points for the scent.",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray
2011-08,2.0,"I just bought this today, 7 dollars at walmart. I was going to buy suave professionals heat protection instead for 3 dollars. I have naturally wavy hair that I air-dried last night after I colored it (natural instincts cinnaberry). I sprayed this on and ran the iron through it today and it robbed my hair of the shine it already had and the softness too. Maybe this is because I didn't blowdry my hair as usual with the usual 5 products and didn't have an already semi-straight base to start with. I'm not sure, It did seem to straighten it a bit but my hair definitely doesn't look or feel any better.

I'll update this review if it works better the next time I properly wash and blowdry my hair. Until then, big waste of money.

EDIT

Well this is no better than any other spray. Tresemme at least makes your hair feel better.The smell is the only positive, which doesn't stay anyway. I hope at least it protects against damage. Should have gotten the Suave professionals one and saved 4 bucks. Oh, and you get more use out of it if you spray it in your hand instead of directly in your hair.",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray
2011-08,5.0,"I didn't need serum and I didn't need smoothing cream. I didn't need anything because this product worked sooo well. 

Now it only needs a little little spritz because this stuff will make your heavy but ZERO frizz. It holds the style you make with flat iron exactly, and it holds ALL day long!!! 

Amazing! Better than John Frieda -moisturizing and no frizz fried crunchy ends, and not even after I washed my hair. Normally, you can seee the damage after you wash, but not with this stuff because it really protects hair from heat damage. 

I've always been half and half on Organix products, as I think some of it is not so good, but this the best product they've got. It outdoes just about everything in my hoarded hair product collection. 

My hair type is about 2c to 3a, as it gets more curly in the back. A few spritz and a lukewarm iron, and my curls are no where to be seen - you'd think I'm naturally straight. WOW!

Oh yeah, and the bottle, as other reviewers have said, sucks big time. The spray pump is the worst. I put the product into another spray bottle and it worked fantastic. Still, don't let the packaging stop you because this product is worth it - just get a .99 bottle from the travel section.

2011-08,2.0,"[edit: 6/27/11]: I noticed that alcohol denat. is really high on the list, one of the main ingredients, &amp; though I don't use this any more since I ran out, when I was throwing it away I noticed it. Maybe that was why my hair felt rather dry &amp; lackluster towards the end of the bottle. I liked it while i had used it, but I would not spray any form of alcohol [the drying sort anyway] on my hair when I am actively trying to heal it. It may be fine for others with more resilient hair, but mine is fragile. So for this reason I lowered the rating &amp; that I would not buy it again. drying alcohols should have no place in a heat protectant.

This was the first product from this line that I bought, but forgot to create it since there wasn't a listing. Thanks to the other reviewer that did that :) reminded me to post my own review!
Anyway, I really liked this as well. I do rotate it with my few other flat iron sprays, since my hair isn't entirely fond of protein, so I don't want to use an excessive amount. Usually I just scrunch my hair into it's natural wave but since I have fringe bangs, which don't hold a wave well, I flat iron them. This is always what I use for that as well as regular touch ups when I flat iron all of my hair. I love that it doesn't feel sticky [provided you don't use too much!], &amp; even though I do regularly flat iron my bangs I have not seen much, if any, new damage. The part I did have was from my dye job &amp; has already been cut off anyway. The keratin in this probably helps with not causing any more damage &amp; really protecting the hair shaft. 

It really leaves the hair nice &amp; shiny, but since I've also been using my new John Frieda 3 Day Straight, that leaves my hair even more shiny so I use that more often. but, on the 2nd &amp; 3rd days when I have kinks in my hair I use this to protect the hair I'm touching up. The bottle is a bit awkward but I didn't have too many issues with it, since I turned the spray head so that I could hold it easier. Mine didn't leak, unlike the other review on here, so I don't know if some are just a bit looser/defective, but I guess trying to tip it upside down would be a good idea in the store before you buy. At any rate, it's not too expensive, around $6.99 at Walmart, $7.99 at Walgreens/CVS, so it won't break the bank like some other flat iron sprays [ahem...Redken, Alterna!]. :)",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray
2011-08,5.0,"This is the best heat protectant spray ever!  I've tried many heat protectant sprays before and I've never loved any of them as much as this.  I've used Tresemme's (worst), It's a 10 miracle spray, Miracle 7, etc.  &quot;It's a 10&quot; is pretty good but Organix beats them all!  I use this when I'm straightening or curling my hair and it leaves my hair soooo silky, shiny and soft.  I couldn't get over how smooth and shiny it makes my hair, it leaves it looking really healthy which is what I feel like a protectant spray should do.  I don't feel like I'm damaging my hair when I use this but with the Tresemme, I felt like it left my hair feeling a bit dry and frizzy, it had no smoothing effects whatsoever.  I felt like I was damaging my hair when I used it, hated it.  This I will buy again in a heartbeat.  It's $7.99 at Ulta but I've also seen this at Walgreens.  I hate the bottle it comes in, it's an awkward shape and the bottle leaks on top every time I pump the spray.  I tried tightening the cap but that's not the problem.  Hopefully I just got a defective bottle.  Very annoying but I just poured it into a different bottle and it's fine.  Awesome product!
Update: I hope they never discontinue this product!  My hair just doesn't look the same without this stuff.  I tried styling without it once and my hair looked dull, not shiny, and dried out.  Last time I used this, I got a compliment on my hair.  This girl told me my hair looked so shiny and healthy!  I just said thank you but I knew it was this product, lol.",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Flat Iron Spray
2017-08,3.0,"I have naturally wavy-curly, fine-medium textured, color treated hair that is to the middle of my back.  In my quest to find the perfect shampoo/conditioner combination (I use silicone containing styling products, so shampoo is a must), I decided to purchase this and the matching conditioner after reading reviews both here and on Amazon.  

The texture is thick, and spreads more evenly if mixed with a little bit of water or if your hair is thoroughly soaking wet.  It reminds me of the old St. Ives shampoo from back in the 80's, if you are old enough to get that reference.  It is fine as far as not stripping my hair and not leaving it feeling dry, but it doesn't leave it feeling exactly clean, either.  Not a big deal when you rotate shampoos like I do, but there was one big drawback that made this shampoo/conditioner combo a will-not-repurchase for me, and that was *the smell*.  

It smells like my grandmother's bathroom, and not in a good way.  It smells musty and like old Shower to Shower body powder or something.  It doesn't smell nice or perfume-y or floral or anything GOOD.  It just smells old and stale.  No, I didn't get a bad batch or an expired bottle.  Honest to goodness, this stuff just smells horrible to me.  

For a drugstore shampoo, it's pretty pricey, so if it's not working miracles on my hair (it's not), and the smell doesn't make me swoon with joy (absolutely not), then it makes no sense for me to repurchase.  It's a decent enough shampoo, I suppose, just nothing special or wonderful, and the smell (for me, anyway) is an absolute deal breaker.  

YMMV, and all noses are different.  ",Sea Mineral Moisture
2017-08,5.0,"I bought the shampoo and conditioner and really enjoy using both.
They both have a strong ocean scent which for some may be much but for me I find quite pleasant. The shampoo is very thick and needs to be rinsed out well or it can leave residual on the scalp.
I have frizzy, thick, straight hair that is stubborn to keep into a wavy or curled style. After using this shampoo with the conditioner, it gave my hair some texture that helped my hair keep a wavy style and add body. Not only that, but my hair has improved after using a high end shampoo (Redkin Extreme) that completely sucked the life out of it. My hair is now less frizzy, stronger, and fuller thanks to this line. I definately will be repurchasing again once the bottle is empty and recommend it to gals with stubborn straight hair like mine that won't hold a style.",Sea Mineral Moisture

The formula also does not irritate my scalp and overall I feel that this has truly nourished my hair in a stealthy way without weighing it down. Seriously impressed!",Sea Mineral Moisture

2015-08,1.0,"I have problems with most shampoos leaving my my hair feeling like &quot;whipped&quot; feeling, like dry, not wanting to do anything and squeaky clean. It also doesn't help that I have a dry scalp, so it's not like my hair bathes in it's own oil to begin with. Not sure where it comes from but I've always had problems buying shampoo (except Sleek.look from mid 2000s, that one was a keeper, even though it had silicones in it).

CONS: Yeah, I'm getting the same result as I usually do with this shampoo... dry hair that feels like it's been aggressively tamed. Even though Sodium C14-C16 Olefin Sulfonate is supposed to be less drying than sulfates, I think it's just as bad. I also tried a Hask shampoo that had this ingredient and I'm getting the same reaction.

OTHER: This is quite heavily scented. It smells like a too intense beachy scent that went blatantly artificial, and now that I think of it, Sprite, like that other reviewer mentioned.",Sea Mineral Moisture
2015-08,3.0,"The first thing that comes to mind when smelling this, is SPRITE. Yes, the famous refreshing drink. I can't think of any other thing. Maybe a pool?

It does not lather much, and upon rinsing, it leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped. However, it does not leave your hair feeling that soft, and when using conditioner or a leave in along with this shampoo, my hair gets drier during the day, like crunchy. Besides all that, I've noticed a lot more hair falling out, and it gets oily quicker.

",Sea Mineral Moisture
2015-08,3.0,"This shampoo is on the drying side so I would recommend keeping it handy as a weekly clarifying shampoo, as it will cleanse your scalp squeaky-clean and if you have fine hair, therefore shampoo 3x week, you will earn yourself a dry, itchy scalp. Another good insurance policy to take out in order to prevent dehydrating your already split ends is to rub any conditioner you have on your tips pre-shampoo. If used sparingly, you will see improved elasticity of hair and reduced breakage without lifeless stripping. It smells very nice, lathers extremely well so a little goes a very long way and a bottle dispenses just the right amount per squeeze. I think those with oily scalp but with coarser hair would love this shampoo best. Extremely dry, brittle hair should avoid using this. ",Sea Mineral Moisture
2015-08,2.0,"This is the second time I've purchased a set of products from Organix. After the first set of products I bought (from the Moroccan Argan Oil line) absolutely bombed for me, this was me giving Organix a second chance after at least 2 years. I purchased most of the Sea Mineral Moisture system in hopes of turning slowing down the sudden hair splitting I was experiencing (I was due for a trim, but I've never had split ends like this until after I switched off of the Tresemme Keratin Smooth system I had been using for 2 years).

I was sold on the incredible alcoholic mixed-drink smell of the Sea Mineral Moisture products, but unfortunately that's only one of 2 good points for this shampoo. My boyfriend also commented that my hair was soft and touchable again, but I noticed that my split ends were worsening throughout the use of this product.

Additionally, I had the same problem with this system that steered me away from Organix in the first place--the bottles come with 13oz of product, which I had used up in about 2 months compared to the 6 months my shampoos tend to last. This shampoo would clarify my hair and scalp so well too that it would leave my strands feeling squeaky dry--in the shower! So I would use a handful of conditioner at a time to remedy the dryness, and found that the deep conditioner from this same line was more effective than the regular conditioner, though I interchanged both throughout the 2 months I used the system and still didn't quite have the split end issue resolved.

I love that this shampoo smelled amazing and cleaned my hair especially well, but to leave it dried and not at least slowing the end-splitting I was experiencing and on top of that running out of product in 2 months, I would rather invest my money back into the Tresemme products I had been consistently using for 2 years.",Sea Mineral Moisture
2015-08,3.0,"This Product, smelt amazing however because I'm blonde I noticed it made my hair extra yellow toned and also made my roots oily.

2015-08,3.0,I'm torn. I find my hair is shiny and more tame when using this. It does feel soft. BUT I really am not a fan of the smell and my hair gets very greasy fast with it.

2015-08,1.0,Ive always had problems with this brand of shampoo and conditioners. After many times of trying different types of this product this has to be by far one of the worst for me. I have very dry hair due to dying it and I was looking for a product that would replenish the moisture back into my hair and make it shiny again. This did nothing for my hair except dry it out and leave it in knots. I had to use half of my detangled bottle to get the nots out. And to top that off to me the smell was not pleasant either.It just smells like salt water and I personally do not like that scent. But my hair is still dry and it wasn't this dry before I washed it with this shampoo.

I have the shampoo and conditioner so I figured I'd give it a try. I will say that the experience while washing and conditioning my hair with this stuff was, odd, especially the conditioner. However once my hair was dry it was SUPER soft. It took my nothing to brush my hair out, which was a bonus for me considering I always dread brushing my hair after I was it cause I know it's going to be full of knots. This stuff though left my hair feeling amazing. The only reason I probably won't repurchase this is due to the smell. I obviously smelt it when I bought it and in the bottle it had that &quot;sea type&quot; smell, but it didn't seem too overwhelming. However now that I've washed my hair it's ALL I CAN SMELL. It's a mixture of old lady perfume and salt is the best way I can describe it. The smell is sooo strong that it's almost making me want to rewash my hair with something else.

But this stuff is different so I bought the entire line and I'm so happy my hair is extremely silky, shiny and smells great all day! I don't use heat on my hair so when I let it air dry after washing (as I normally do) with this stuff, I immediately noticed a difference !! 5 lipsticks !! Way to go Organix ! &lt;3",Sea Mineral Moisture
2014-08,2.0,"I am hoping that if I keep giving this a try, I can love it as much as the other reviewers do.  As of this review, I will say to its benefit, my hair turns out nice usually when I use it.  However, every other part of this, I don't like.  I found myself cringing when it was time to wash my hair with this. Why do I dread it so much?  Here is why (FYI, I have fine &amp; wavy to curly  hair):

Scent - At first I told myself it was &quot;fresh&quot; but then when I was using it, all I could think of was the reviewer who compared the scent to industrial bathroom cleaner...and the more I used it, the more that is exactly what it smelled like to me.

Washing with it - I have used tons of sulfate free shampoos, so it isn't just that....I know how to make sulfate free stuff work. This stuff just had no viscosity.  It would not &quot;work&quot; into my hair or leave the crown feeling clean.  It didn't even get the one tangled dirty spot I will always get to loosen.  And because the poor viscosity it tore out/ caused hair to break so much more because I had to work so hard to get it all around my head to clean.  When I rinsed this out, I always needed to rely on conditioner to untangle that spot that gets tangled....it was literally matted up like a fur ball.

Next day hair - I found my hair getting oilier faster than usual at the scalp when  I used this.  So getting second or third day  hair was very hard.

So if I figure out a way to love this stuff (and I want to because it is dirt cheap), I will update and change.  Right now I prefer the GVP generic for Biolage Color Care (old version), L'Anza Healing Moisture or AG Smooth or Colour Savour.",Sea Mineral Moisture
2014-08,5.0,"Ive tried almost all the Organix shampoos and conditioners. This is my fave :)
It leaves my thick coarse hair actually smooth and super soft. I have to admit, the best thing I like is the fact that the smell lasts the next day. And when I shower my whole bathroom smells like a beach.

2014-08,4.0,"At last, a worthy replacement for my much-lamented John Frieda Cool Dip shampoo! I ran across this in the drugstore the other day, quite by accident, and bought it strictly for its fragrance and pretty turquoise bottle. Turns out to be a really nice shampoo- pearly aqua color, nice silky texture, lathers well, and leaves my mid-back length, slightly wavy, colored hair clean, soft and smelling great. I haven't tried any of the other products in this range, but just ordered a bunch online- to be reviewed in the future. I did not care for any of the 3 OGX shampoos I've tried, so this was a pleasant surprise. ",Sea Mineral Moisture
2014-08,5.0,I've tried many of the shampoos in the Organix line. The sea mineral works the best for my hair in conjunction with the awapuhi conditioner. This combination provides just the right amount of moisture to my hair to lay the foundation for daily blow drying.,Sea Mineral Moisture
2014-08,5.0,"I have very damaged hair because I had gotten it bleached and nothing seemed to help my dry hair. It was so rough and not soft. I tried this product because I read a lot of good reviews so why not give it a try? I really love this shampoo and conditioner, this shampoo has not only made it softer it actually made it shiny to. On the bottle it says it heals split ends, to be honest it has helped my split ends but it didn't exactly heal them. The first day I tried this shampoo and conditioner I was disappointed.  My hair wasn't very soft, but on the 4 to 5th wash my hair became so soft. This shampoo really cleans the hair to. People do not like the smell for some reason, I think it smells like mtn. Dew. Overall I love this product and will continue to use it after I finish the bottle.",Sea Mineral Moisture
2014-08,4.0,"I honestly bought this product because I love trying out Organix products but I don't regret buying it. I always smell their products before i buy it and this one smells interesting. It has a really strong salty smell (hence the sea mineral) but it usually goes away after a day or two of using it and that's the thing i love the most about this product. The first time i use it i went 3 days without washing my hair which is crazy! I have straight, thing, relatively oily hair and this made my hair feel so soft and it kept the oil away for 3 days! i would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to go as long as possible without washing their hair!

I was using the Cherry Blossom and was getting tired the scent but I was happy with that one and I just wanted a change and a bit more conditioning.  Honestly, the sea mineral formula is the best one and my favorite shampoo.  The fragrance is fabulous and fresh.  It is not floral but fresh and almost herbal, the way I want a shampoo to smell.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable and keeps it shiny.  It is inexpensive compared to shampoos that perform this way and it is sulfate free keeping my hair in good condition.",Sea Mineral Moisture

I have collarbone length wavy hair and this shampoo makes the most of my natural texture without having to add in a bunch of other products to keep it frizz-free. I can just let my hair air dry and I get lots of volume and wave which is wonderful. I love that this smells like the beach and keeps my hair in great shape all while making my hair routine a lot shorter. It foams up easily and rinses clean and doesn't leave residue - a problem I've had with other sulfate-free shampoos. I haven't always had the best of luck with Organix shampoos, but this one is a keeper!",Sea Mineral Moisture
2013-08,5.0,"It's a nice product for dry over-processed straw hair. I went from dyed black to blonde, which can often be a death sentence to hair. The shampoo and conditioner really saved the day. In about a week my hair was back to a good condition. 
The scent is also a nice change from the super flowery perfumed hair products. As much as I liked it, there are other Organyx products (like the Coconut Macadamia nut) that I prefer.

2013-08,5.0,"Love it! It has a nice creamy lather and actually feels kind of luxurious! It gets my hair clean without stripping it or leaving any tacky residue behind. I pair it with the matching conditioner and also have the moisture surge deep conditioner from this line and love them as well. It leaves my hair clean, hydrated, and weightless. This line literally makes my hair feel fluffy and voluminous. I'm not sure if it would be moisturizing enough for anyone with extremely dry hair, but it's the perfect amount of moisture for my color treated / dry hair. After I use these products in the shower, I use the Organix Moroccan Argan Penetrating Oil on my towel dried hair then blow dry and my hair comes out weightless and silky every time.. Highly recommend! (For anyone with my hair type, I also really enjoy the Awapuhi Ginger and Moroccan Argan Oil shampoo / conditioners from this brand!) ",Sea Mineral Moisture
2013-08,5.0,"Okay, so I have used Head and Shoulders Shampoo for years, because I have a itchy flaky scalp with oily hair. I always try other shampoos though because I am board with the H.S. shampoo. I normally try ones with tee tree, and any other high end shampoos to see if it will work with my hair and scalp, but nope I always have to go back to plain H.S. 
I was at CVS looking for some...shampoo, and after recently buying the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil conditioner I was going to try the shampoo too. Well I saw that they had this new Sea Mineral shampoo and loved the smell, and decided to buy it. Well I am soooo glad I did! This is my new HG shampoo!  I have been using it for a month now, and my hair has never looked better! After one wash without conditioner my long wavy hair was sooo unbelievably soft, bouncy, weightless, and shiny! My hair after any shampoo has never felt or looked this good! Its like when you go to the salon for a good cut, that kind of look and feel! I had just recently started using conditioner because my ends were starting to look dry from using sea salt sprays this shampoo took care of that problem! I made my sister try this and she has verrrrrry very super duper thick coarse curly dry hair and she loves it. She doesn't like anything! I know everyones different, but if you have been looking to buy this....Do it! Its cheap and IMHO definitely worth a try. 
It's perfect for any hair type it seems! Thank goodness I no longer have to use Head and Shoulders anymore!

2013-08,5.0,"This shampoo and the corresponding conditioner are amazing. I've been using the Organix Argan original and Argan Creme lines for about 6 months and decided to give this one go. Good lord, my hair looks amazing. My overall experience with Organix has left my hair super soft and shiny, but the Sea Mineral really enhanced my naturally wavy hair. Most shampoos weigh my hair down and get rid of my natural wave, but I look like a beach goddess after using this. My waves are smooth, defined, bouncy and flowy. The smell is pleasant and lingers on my hair after washing. Will definitely re-purchase. All my wavy-haired girls, definitely give this a try! ",Sea Mineral Moisture
2013-08,5.0,"So I tried this Organix NEW shampoo. And I have to say compared to another Organix one I was using... I LOVE IT. I was about to give up on Organix and find another organic brand of shampoo because these keep my forehead from breaking out but they were just... okay for my hair and my hair was starting to dry out and just look thick and dull.

One use of this on my scalp and the Kukui conditioner on my ends and the next morning my hair was SHINY and SOFT. Love it even if the smell is not as good as the others it is sooo worth it. I will update this after I finish the bottle to see if there is any residue or long term affects. But for right now... my HG Shampoo!!

EDIT: Hair is still BEAUTIFUL after finishing the bottles or even more so. Still my HG shampoo and Kukui is HG conditioner. Hair just keeps staying shiny and healthy. FINALLY. I was getting damn tired of going through Organix Shampoos, this was only thing that saved me from giving up on the brand entirely.",Sea Mineral Moisture
2017-08,4.0,"I like how OGX has instructions on how to use, but out of the 5 listed (4 for hair and 1 for body), the last one has worked the best for me:
5. On Body: Apply to dry skin (in or out of shower), massage in thoroughly. For best results, use on damp skin immediately after you shower.

This makes my skin really smooth, especially to the dry area around the elbows. 
I either dry brush pre-shower and then massage this oil after shower, or I massage in this oil after shower then dry brush. It absorbs well and I alternate it with Cetaphil body lotion.
I rated this 4 out 5 because for the price, it works much better than other more popular pricey brand out there (i.e. I bought The Body Shop Wild Argan Oil after this one finishes - it doesn't work as good and it comes in a terrible spray plastic bottle though it smells nice.)

The only reason I wouldn't buy it again is because I want to try other body oil products and I don't really like the smell of this one. It's not a bad smell, just not sure how to describe it.

By far, this takes frizz and flyaways for me. Make the hair super soft however for curls (my hair was permed) it doesn't really retain bounce or define curls. It's males my hair more sleek, and limp somewhat. For me that's fine as I have volumnous hair anyway.

I'm impartial to the scent, preferring the keratin/argan range but it does it job. Upside it's great as a light mister before I leave the home, sleek, controllable super soft hair. Downside, scent is so-so, used often, I need to wash more often too as scalp gets greasy faster.

Pros: Great smell. Very beachy but not overpowering or cloying
It does provide some light moisturizing, but won't help you if you have truly dry hair. 
Makes hair feel nice and soft. 

Cons: It's sorta greasy -- when I apply it and run my fingers through my hair they come out so slippery I have to wash my hands for quite some time afterward. 
It moisturizes, but you have to be REALLY careful not to put even one drop too much on or your hair will go from &quot;shiny and soft&quot; to &quot;grease slick&quot; in a heartbeat. 
For the price, it does not perform nearly as well as similar brands.

2015-08,5.0,"I love this product. I have wavy hair that gets dry at the ends, and this stuff makes it super soft.     It feels light and makes my hair very shiny. It's a very fine mist that goes on dry, not wet / oily.
When I first used it, I thought my hair might have looked the tiniest bit piecey, like when it starts to get oily - but I brushed it through (first with a detangling brush and again with a boar brush, and my hair completely soaked it up. I use this a couple of times a day now and haven't had the same issue since. 
I put in a few spritzes while my hair is damp, and a bunch more when it's dry (concentrating most of the sprays at the ends, but then one or two overtop of my whole head, then finger comb it through, followed by a light brushing if needed). 
I love the smell too. I know a few people weren't too happy with the scent but I think it's very pleasant. My partner told me, &quot;oh wow, your hair smells amazing! what is that? you smell like a mermaid!&quot;
The price isn't terrible, but it's up there - $8.99 CAD in my area, but I think it's worth it.

There just wasn't enough moisturization and there was almost no curl definition.  It left my hair feeling soft, but that's only because it was a big, floofy, frizzy cloud of fuzz.  That's not surprising, since dimethicone is the third ingredient, coconut oil fifth, and lemon oil  and orange extract are seventh and eighth.  I don't even get why citrus extracts would be included in a &quot;moisturizing&quot; conditioner,, since those strip your hair.

2013-08,5.0,"I'm really impressed with this stuff! I have wavy/curly hair that turns into frizzy, flyaway city if it even looks humid outside, so it's hard for me to find curling products I really like. The way I would describe my waves is crazy and disorganized-waves and curls going every which way, and I often have to take a straightener to them to calm them down and look acceptable. I put the cream on after I showered and scrunched lightly at the ends. My hair is maybe a few inches past my shoulder blades and I only needed a dime-sized amount. I immediately noticed the curls in my hair looked better as it started to dry. Because I wasn't styling it, my hair dried on its own, in its own sections and some of those sections were so beautifully curled, you would have thought I used a curling iron. My curls were soft and &quot;organized&quot; so to say and I was so happy. I did flip my hair upside down to apply it, so the bottom layers were more curly than the top, so I have to remember that. Even after sleeping on it, my curls were still manageable the next day. The scent is very pleasant, but not overpowering at all. I tend to get an oily scalp very fast, but this didn't leave my hair greasy or crunchy at all! Humidity protection could have been slightly better, but I'm currently in the middle of a scorching heat wave with high humidity in my area, so great looking hair is hopeless for everyone. Nothing that pairing the cream with a good leave-in conditioner can't fix (I absolutely SWEAR by healthy sexy hair tri-wheat leave-in). And the heat/UV protection is a great plus!

I doesn't interfere with any of my perfumes. I can't imagine anyone not being able to use this because their hair was scented too strongly.  This stuff is fabulous. I have tried so many curl creams - I actually have a shopping bag full of unloved creams but this one is excellent.  Doesn't leave my hair crunchy, nor does it feel sticky, even in humid weather. Doesn't leave my fine hair greasy either. I love that it creates soft waves, even encourages curls, instead of weighing them down. Gives so much body and leaves my hair semi-matte (not too shiny, which I prefer). It has the perfect amount of hold. Small amount is needed (nickel). I finish off with a couple of sprays of Organix Sea Spray (will write a separate review) and my hair is soft, smooth and moisturized. My hair isn't frizzy, thankfully, so I can't attest to how well it controls frizz. The packing is brilliant. Easy to use squeeze bottle. Can't beat the price.

2012-08,5.0,"If this is for the Moroccan argan oil curling cream, this product is great! I love literally everything about it. It curls BEAUTIFULLY. I wasn't expecting to like this product as much as I did, but it was a really good price -- about $8.99 at CVS, where I knew I could return it for my money back if I didn't like it, for a 6-oz bottle. First of all, it is thicker than I expected it to be, almost like some of the products in Aveda's Dry Remedy line. It's definitely not &quot;sticky,&quot; but it's almost more &quot;honey-like,&quot; like imagine if you took a regular styling cream and put corn starch in it. Personally, I like this about it. It seems to absorb water (I find it works best when my hair is a little more damp than normal, like if I don't leave it in a towel quite as long as I would for other styling products) and the curls it produces are beautiful, tightly-wound spirals; they have structure and hold. My hair is both fine and curly, so it's difficult for me to find a product that will really tighten up my naturally soft and loose curl. This one does it! Also, it does NOT make my hair feel sticky or crunchy -- it feels every bit as soft and natural as I want it to be. So in short, it makes my hair tightly curled and beautiful, shiny, soft, natural-feeling, and it also makes my hair feel (and look) thicker. There really isn't much of a fragrance to this product - there is somewhat of a very faint fragrance in the bottle, but it is so light that I can barely even smell it. By the time I've worked it into my hair completely, the fragrance is gone (and what little scent is there is pleasant and mild). Finally, the packaging is really adorable -- I love the turquoise color, the simple shape, and the size. It looks very attractive on my dresser, especially considering it came from a drugstore.

2012-08,2.0,"I got this on sale for a few dollars off of the regular price. I purchased this on the same day I got the Organix Macadamia Oil conditioner and shampoo, both of which my hair loves very much. I have very curly hair, so I wanted to try this cream to see if it helped combat frizz and define my curls. I have used this a few different times, and I am not impressed at all. It doesn't do much for my hair. It doesn't define curls, or keep them together. The only plus, and the reason I gave it 2 stars is the smell. It smells really nice, and reminds me of the original Pantene shampoo/conditioner. However, there are better curling creams out there.",Curling Perfection Defining Cream
2017-08,2.0,"I wanted to like this hair butter since my hair loves thick, buttery leave ins, but unfortunately this one didn't do it for me. It goes on smooth upon applying, smells delicious, and seems to moisturize, but it literally feels like I just spread water on my hair with the speed that my hair sucks up the moisture. I'm talking I apply this butter and the moment I've moved on to another section my hair feels like I never applied any moisture in the first place. This would probably be better for hair types that don't need heavier moisture, but unfortunately for me it didn't work. ",Shea Soft & Smooth Creamy Hair Butter
2017-08,1.0,"This is one sorry conditioner, and it's pretty rare of me to find conditioners that I just can't make work. I used this conditioner with the accompanying shampoo to this line. Keep in mind that I have long (mid back/waist length), dense, very thick and kinky hair. I was excited to see a line at the drugstore that boasted no silicones or sulfates but when I went to use this conditioner after their shampoo (which left my hair soft and still moisturized, by the way) I could feel the moisture being sucked out of my hair. I like to only comb my hair when I'm in the shower conditioning and this conditioner made it impossible to do so. This conditioner left my hair feeling knottier and drier than a SHAMPOO. How does that even happen?! Needless to say, this doesn't work for me at all. Must be for finer or less curly hair types, even though I was sure a line with shea butter would do the trick for me.

If I liked the rest of the line I'd repurchase BUT unfortunately this is the only product from this line that I enjoyed and I like to use shampoos and conditioners from the same line.

I can use it when my skin is already in a good condition, but if my skin is sensitive and irritated this doesn't do a very good job, it is not moisturizing enough and the parfume will irritate my skin.

It is not a smell you can put your finger on, but it does smell delicious! It reminds me of summer and beach (always happy tiimes!!).

2013-08,5.0,"AH! Finally a product i can really get behind. Ladies your search is over. Look no more. This is the Holy Grail of all lotions. I have searched and searched and searched through what seemed like countless years for a lotion that once applied, did not leave a sticky residue on my skin. This is it. Let me start by saying the price CANNOT be beat. I bought it at my resident BJs Wholesaler and it cost me 3.49 for an 16 ounce bottle. U heard right ladies. The smell is divine, it stays on the skin for quite a while and it makes your skin feel and look like silk, without it being glittery. Its very lightly moustirizing, which for the Sub Tropical climate i live on is the best thing, maybe if i lived somewhere colder and less humid this would not do much, nonetheless at least its the ideal summertime lotion regardless of your location. Once applied the scent lingers, a somewhat perfumie youthful scent, although i find it very delicate and sensual. Never have i applied a lotion that absorbs as quickly, once applied it sinks it within seconds and leaves in its place a silky texture to the skin, not one ounce of that lotiony residue which has been my arch nemesis  and the reason Im always in the search for the next better and newer thing. If i had to describe how my skin feels, it would be somewhat powdery, but without any graininess whatsoever, just soft and smooth, and after a minute it does not feel like you have lotion on, this is not a product that just sits on top of the skin at all.  I cannot wait to try the body wash and the other products in this line. A strange thing happens when you realize a products cost is not in direct correlation with its effectiveness. I have tried extremely expensive lotions which have done nothing for me. My advice is to give this amazing product a try ladies, for the cost, you really dont have much to loose.", Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion
2013-08,5.0,"During the winter my body skin dries out quite badly, so during those months I need something richer than this. For the rest of the year though, this stuff is my holy grail of body lotions. The scent is amazing, and it makes my skin feel like silk. Although you don't get as much product in this bottle as most other body lotions, I find that I need so little of it to do my whole body that this stuff actually lasts much longer than other body lotions I have used with more product in them. Organix is a fantastic line of products.", Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion
2012-08,5.0,"Just bought this on sale at CVS and I really like it.  The scent is hard to describe.  It smells to me a little more complex than most drug store lotions, sort of like a floral perfume but with a slight citrus and spice note instead of powder which keeps it young.  It appeals to me and its one of the reasons I purchased it but it is pretty fragrant so some might not care for it.  Smells a lot like the conditioner of the same name.   I bought it for the scent and because I like the cute packaging of Organix and that they don't test on animals. 
  I was pleasantly surprised at how ungreasy this stuff is.  With oils in it I expected to be a greasy mess but this stuff sinks in quickly.  It gives a nice sheen and makes my skin feel smooth, almost like its been powdered. There is actually a tiny bit of shimmer but I have to look really close at my skin to see it and it doesn't scream &quot;I rubbed on something sparkly&quot;.  This would be a good lotion for summer.  I will have to wait several days to find out just how moisturizing it is, but right now its looking like a nice light moisturizer.

I find this shampoo to be very clarifying, but it cleans without stripping my hair.  My hair is normal and I can get dry scalp in winter, but this shampoo doesn't aggravate any scalp flakes.  The smell is absolutely heavenly, so refreshing and invigorating after a long day (I shower at night), and I especially love using it after I've been cycling outside in the heat.  I paid $8.99 at Walgreen's which seems pricey for a shampoo but I expect the bottle to last a good while with 3x/week use.  I will repurchase this to use through the summer, but I need a more moisturizing shampoo for winter.  Four stars.",Intensely Invigorating Eucalyptus Mint Shampoo
2017-08,5.0,"This is absolutely my HG shampoo. For reference I have oily hair with dandruff that has a balayage. I have very oily roots, an itchy scalp and dry ends. I absolutely can't stand moisturizing shampoos as they make my scalp extra itchy. Dandruff is caused by an overproduction of oil so I need something that rinses clean.

This shampoo is absolutely fantastic. The artificial fragrance is very low on the list of ingredients and it does not smell too strong. It contains Aluminium lauryl sulfate which is very cleansing but I find much less irritating in my scalp than sodium lauryl sulfate. It also contains tea tree, eucalyptus and mint oil which are very purifying. It has a thicker gel texture which makes it very easy to use. It does contain one silicone which I usually hate but it does not leave residue on my scalp. 

What makes this my HG are too things: my scalp does not itch anymore even on day 2 hair and it does not dry my ends out (I shampoo the scalp only).

The conditioner was easy to apply and I would typically leave for 3-5 minutes as I went about shaving or skincare routines.

I admit, I never quite know what it means when a product says it is &quot;rejuvenating&quot; or &quot;revitalizing.&quot;  But whatever this is supposed to do it fails.  First, I hate just getting it out of the stupid bottle.  Even when the bottle was totally full I had to shake it upside down and squeeze really hard to get anything out.  The conditioner is fairly thick and the bottle is not designed to let the liquid out easily.  Next is the product itself.  It isn't moisturizing in the least and does not leave my hair feeling smooth, detangled and moist.  In fact it feels rough, tangled and dry.

What I love about this conditioner is the smell. Heavenly! by bathroom smells amazing for the entire day, and the smell stays in my hair until my next wash. I wash my hair once every 3 days, but I do wear my hair up the majority of the time, so maybe thats why. But the smell also withstands heat styling too. I get compliments on how good my hair smells all the time
In reality tho, I did not find this to be a good conditioner. At all. I leave the shower and my hair is SOOOO tangled, it's ridicoulous. I might as well just not have conditioned at all.

While the scent is nice, this conditioner only gives good results during the spring and fall seasons, when there is no humidity, but once the rainy season and high summer are in swing, I have to shelve it because it doesn`t help with frizz at all. I hate the packaging because it is so hard to squeeze out the last drops and cannot be stored upside down. Also I`ve learned that products that claim to contain argan oil need to have at least 20% argan oil in their composition for them to be effective: I don`t think Organix contains that much argan oil, because other argan oil products give much better results, in particular Moroccan Oil and Josie Maran.

I think that this product works well with my established hair regimen. 

I wash my hair every other day using Organix Tea Tree Mint Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. And about every two or three washes I use this Renewing Treatment in place of my regular conditioner. After shampooing, I apply this liberally throughout my hair, focusing the product on the ends. I leave it in for about 7-10 minutes while I resume the rest of my shower routine. I LOVE how my hair feels when this rinses out -- so soft, silky and smooth. I also need to mention that this smells HEAVENLY. And the scent lingers long after my hair has dried, so if that's not your thing then this may not be the product for you. Fortunately, I quite like this effect and I find the scent delicious. 

For those of you looking for an overnight miracle hair product, this isn't it. I nearly finished my first tub before I started to notice a significant improvement in the texture of my hair. Consistency is key, as well as using this in conjunction with other Organix products like the the instructions recommend. I'm now on my fifth tub and I will continue to repurchase, as I have finally found the right products to make up the system that works for me. 

I follow up with a small amount of Organix Keratin Anti-Breakage Serum on my damp, towel-dried hair and then Biosilk Silk Therapy Hair Serum after straightening. The result? My hair is hydrated, soft and silky to the touch and no longer coarse and unmanageable. 

Just note that this is product is only meant to be PART of a good hair care routine; so you can't expect spectacular results by just using it on its own.

The bleach really damaged my hair, as it is not very thick and my hair is pretty dry. Fast forward, I recently had my hair redone after months of letting it grow out, and my new hairdresser said that my hair is pretty dry and that I should use a deep conditioner. So I went to my local CVS and found this, Organix Moroccan Oil deep conditioning stuff. It doesn't work. At all. I followed the directions completely shower cap, hot towel, etc. When I rinsed it out, it made my hair feel like it was dryer then when I initially put it in! It made my hair really dry looking, my ends are really frizzy, and it made my hair really knotted and hard to brush through. Also, it smelled really, really nice in jar, but on my hair I can barely smell anything!

I know the actual amount of Argan oil in it is minimal, but it works so well in my hair-what does it matter?

I used this only once, but with conditioners, I know after one wash if it improves my hair. Actually, while your washing the conditioner out of your hair you just know if it works by the texture of your hair. 

- I put a good amount of this conditioner in my hair (only from the ears down), focusing on my ends of course. i felt like the product evaporated or something, felt like there was nothing in my hair. I even put a bit more in my hair and it felt the same. I let it sit in my hair for a minute and rinsed it out, and it felt NO DIFFERENT from before I put the conditioner.
- it did NOT soften my hair, didn't detangle it, didn't feel silky. It felt like it dried my hair out.
- any and all conditioners i have tried have at least made my hair feel silky and soft. didn't matter what brand. this conditioner was a true disappointment
- mind you, after i washed this conditioner out, I put some of my Clear scalp &amp; hair therapy conditioner in because my hair didn't feel conditioned.
- my hair was very difficult to brush through while blow-drying after using this.

2013-08,5.0," Organix is a drugstore hair care line that offers a huge selection of products. This brand has always appealed to me, but I never grabbed anything from them. A while ago I caved and bought the Moroccan Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Treatment. Organix says this product will &quot;renew your hair's inner health with argan oil, nutrients, antioxidants, and vitamin e. Organix Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Treatment is a deep conditioning, exotic formula to add brilliant shine and create lush softness without leaving any heavy residue that can weigh hair down&quot;. Not surprisingly, this product contains very little argan oil, but that doesn't keep Organix from making some big claims on the trendy ingredient's behalf. Organix claims that their Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil line contains &quot;a unique, precious blend of Moroccan Argan Oil which instantly penetrates the hair shaft, restoring shine and softness while strengthening and creating soft, seductive, and silky perfection.&quot; I got my 8fl oz (237 ml) tub at Ulta for free on a BOGO deal, I believe it regularly retails for about $7. Organix is a total misnomer, there isn't anything organic about this brand, but at least it's cruelty free. This hair treatment was made in America.
 I think the thing that most appeals to me about Organix is their packaging. It's really vibrant and eye catching and I like the way each line of products is color coordinated. The Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Treatment comes in a recyclable, oval shaped, sky blue tub topped with a gold lid. The tub is covered with information. The front of the tube features the product name, Organix logo, and a description of the formula. The back of the tub offers a longer description, directions, and a full ingredient list. Good job, Organix, its not every day a company creates good looking, informative packaging.
 Organix' Intense Moisturizing Treatment is a dense, but not overly thick, off white cream. Organix recommends smoothing or combing a small amount through wet hair, applying it from root to tip. For best results you're instructed to cover your hair with a towel or shower cap. For me, and my thick, tangly hair, I rub about half a palmful through my hair and twist it up with a clip, leaving it in for roughly 5-8 minutes (Organix recommends 3-5 minutes). The Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Treatment can be a little stubborn to rinse out, it really bonds to the hair. Once rinsed out, I notice an immediate difference in my hair. This treatment is excellent for detangling, it undoes my most stubborn knots with absolutely no effort. This product really seems to deep condition my hair, softening it and keeping it silky and shiny without adding any weight to my hair. I follow up with the matching Weightless Healing Dry Oil to really seal the moisture in. By the way, Organix' Moroccan Argan Oil line smells great, it has a sexy musky floral scent that clings to the hair.
Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Treatment is a nice hair mask to use once a week or so. I prefer a straight up hair oil, but this will do in a pinch. I really love how well Organix' treatment detangles and keeps my hair silky. This product has never weighted my hair down or made my hair or scalp oily. Plus it makes my hair smell great. I recommend Organix Intense Moisturizing Treatment if you have dry or easily tangled hair. This product truly lives up to it's claims and I can really appreciate that. I won't repurchase this product right away, but I can definitely see myself grabbing another tub one day, and I'll definitely be trying more from Organix.

I do have some issues with the packaging- the amount of product in the tub is way too small, I have used almost half of it in one week. I also don't think the consistency is good, it's little too liquidly. But those are external things I'm more than ready to ignore for the results I've gotten.

I was in the market for a deep conditioner at CVS the other day and decided to pick up the Organix Renewing Moroccan Oil Intense Moisturizing Treatment (the one in the little blue tub). I've been interested in companies that include a lot of natural ingredients in their products, so I decided to give the Organix brand a try. I've heard what great things Moroccan Oil (aka Argan oil) can do for your hair. I've got to say, this stuff makes my hair silky smooth and incredibly shiny! I've only used it twice now so it's probably a little early for a review but I can tell you that it really does work. I don't have especially dry hair, (in fact it can get a little oily - I'm quite an active person and therefore sweat and my hair gets dirty/greasy) I just wanted something that would keep it nice and healthy. I was a little confused on how this is meant to be used but this is how I do it; once a week, after I've shampooed and conditioned, I take a scoop of this stuff and work it through my hair (I brush it before I get in the shower) and then finger comb it through. I leave it in for 5 minutes and rinse with cool to luke warm water as directed. I haven't tried the shower cap and hot towel method as the directions say...it seems like too much mess/work for me, but I'll eventually do it.

I was right, it did absolutely nothing for my hair, in fact it was more drying than I expected. I have no idea why they describe it as a hydrating shampoo. Not only that but the scent does not last at all. I couldn't even smell at all it once I got out of the shower.

It lathers really well but it felt like my hair kept sticking to my finger nails which is really odd.  I've never had a shampoo do this before.  I got my nails done 4 days ago and there is no reason for this weird sticky feeling from the shampoo.  I don't feel like it was hydrating, more like it was stripping my hair of moisture because it was also a real order trying to brush through my hair afterward (I used the companion conditioner as well).  One thing to mention about the packaging - it may look nice but it's extremely difficult to get the product out of the bottle.  I can see a lot of waste by not being able to get it all out when you are near the end.  Although I may not even bother trying to be honest.  I think I paid $8.99 on sale for the shampoo and in my opinion it isn't worth even $1.99.  This one was an all around disappointment for me.",Heavenly Hydration Cherry Blossom Shampoo
2015-08,4.0,"I have both the shampoo and conditioner for this scent and so far so good. My favorite thing about this product is the scent, it is a wonderful cherry blossom scent. It's more of a pure cherry blossom scent than the ginseng and cherry blossom one from the same company. And it's not as woody or musky as some &quot;japanese cherry blossom&quot; type scents can be (I'm thinking mainly of the Japanese Cherry Blossom scent from Bath and Body Works). On top of having a nice scent, this shampoo and conditioner has wonderful lasting power! I washed my hair almost 48 hours ago and I still get nice wafts of the scent when my hair moves. And the scent is very present when I actually go to sniff the hair! And in addition to that, I have even put products in my hair after washing it and the cherry blossom scent shines through. I love it! 
 I have read other reviews of this product saying that it's not as hydrating as some of the other OGX shampoos and conditioners, as well as lamenting the fact that there's not some sort of serum with a matching scent. For those two concerns what I can say is that I haven't noticed the shampoo or conditioner being particularly lacking in moisturizing qualities, however, I often do coconut oil hair masks on my hair because of previous bleach damage so that could be a part of it. But this shampoo and conditioner is moisturizing enough for my needs. And as far as a serum or oil goes, I've been using the Coconut Water dry oil from OGX as well as the occasional Argan Oil treatment and I've always been able to smell the scent of this shampoo even through the scent of the other products.

It worked fine at first, but after using it for a while, I noticed how frizzy and dry my hair was becoming. I don't heat style my hair anymore but this conditioner did terrible things to my ends. It made it seem like all I'd done with straighten my ends over and over (in terms of the dryness and frazzled look). I also noticed that it made my scalp so dry that I got dandruff. It made my scalp itch and flake like crazy. I also, at one point, tried washing my makeup brushes with this. They ended up slightly stiffer than they used to be. I also tried using this as a shaving cream when I ran out for a brief period. It made my legs SO dry that they looked grey (and this is coming from someone who is tan all year round).

The products from this line smell incredible like mixed alcoholic drinks, and they do leave my hair feeling soft, touchable, and with just enough volume and control. My hair won't oil up until I go a 2nd day in a row without washing my hair.

However, with this conditioner specifically, it would take literally a handful of conditioner to get my hair to feel soft and actually conditioned. And even then, this did not yield its promise of taming split-ends--an unusually huge problem I had out of nowhere, just prior to purchasing this system. Sure, this calls for a trim, but after that I'll be trying a different conditioner.

Also, if I were to ever repurchase a conditioner from this line again--and simply because it takes a lot of product to get results from any Organix hair care line, in my experience--I would skip this conditioner and just get 2 tubes of the deep conditioner, which actually has almost exactly the same ingredient list as the regular conditioner except for maybe 4 things, and it's only 8oz of product I think. It yields much softer hair.. but split ends are still rampant. Such a disappointment, Organix... yet again.",Sea Mineral Conditioner

The smell is interesting.  It has a very fresh and clean type of scent that will remind you of ocean but without the salt.  I can't exactly describe it but I really do like it.

The shampoo definitely cleanses my scalp and every strand but the conditioner does not de-frizz my hair enough. When I flat iron it after using these products, it's smooth with no frizz, but naturally my dry ends will float away from my head giving that weird teased look, as if I don't know how to brush my hair. If you have damaged hair or split ends, try doing two conditioning sessions and let it sit a while and definitely invest in some oil treatment.

I tried it because of the rave reviews, because I love love OGX Moroccan Argan Curling Cream for styling my somewhat wavy, oily scalp/dry ends hair, and because I got it on sale at Walgreens for $6. I was especially intrigued by one reviewer noting it helped her itchy, irritated scalp. 

The first night I used it, I really liked it. The smell is odd, like a muffled beach salt smell. I like the smell of their Argan and Biotin line better. But it was a good middle ground between moisturizing and clarifying shampoos. My hair felt soft and not weighed down when it dried (though Nexxus Keraphix conditioner may have more to do with that). It wasn't squeaky, dry clean like the (irritating) Tea Tree shampoo from OGX. It was nice. 

However, after 2-3 uses, I noticed my scalp acne or painful bumps coming back. I have three cyst like, inflamed, painful bumps on the left side of my scalp, and the rest of my scalp itches. 

This has glycol distearate, the ingredient that makes shampoos pearlescent. That's been said to cause acne and irritation in many people. Same for algae extract, which (though I take these ratings with a large grain if salt) ranks 5/5 on comedogenicity rating scales. I'm not sure which ingredient, or combination thereof, is responsible, but I'll have to take this back. I have also noticed a bit more breakage, which to be fair may be from my weekly Suave clarifying shampoo, but it's too much to risk it.

Its rich and leaves my hair shiny yet not weighed down.  My issues with it are the smell and the packaging.  The scent smells good on first whiff but it is a heavy scent that lingers.  By the end of the night it was making me slightly sick.  The bottle is another issue.  Its very cute but because this conditioner is so thick the thick plastic bottle makes it very difficult once the bottle is half empty to get any out.  I really need both hands to squeeze it and that doesn't work when I have to squeeze the product into one hand.  Overall a good product though.,Sea Mineral Conditioner
2013-08,4.0,"My local Walgreens was having a BOGO sale on Organix and I saw that this was new. I loved the light teal colored bottle and I noticed that this has a pretty high glycerine level so it would be perfect for me to use in the summer. The smell is not my favorite though. It has a very generic lime-like smell and it lingers. The good thing is that this gives good slip and shine. The sea kelp and sea mineral extracts are in the middle of the ingredient list and I think it did a pretty good job of moisturizing my hair. I have yet to try the Kukui conditioner to see if I like that one better. It does give a bit of weight to my hair without pulling my curls as much, although I am not sure how it performs with the matching shampoo. Organix has surprisingly worked well for my hair in the past so I would say if you do well in general with the line, it wouldn't hurt to try it out.

It's still loaded with sulfates and alcohols, so if you're looking for a more natural product, this isn't it. 

I was given this awhile back, along with the shampoo, and I gave it a few months, since hair needs time to adjust to new products and I figured this might work better after a few weeks, like other products I've tried. Instead, it's just been worse and worse since I started using it. It's to the point now where combing my (short, not even chin-length) hair is a painful, time-consuming process, and it feels rough and a little frizzy afterwards. 

That being said, it does moisturize my hair without making it oily, which is nice for combination hair like mine. Sadly, I won't be rebuying, since the benefits aren't worth ripping out chunks of hair every time I wash and brush it.",Shea Butter Conditioner

I wanted to use an organic product because I had used Giovanni line and loved it but they were too expensive. I've noticed my hair is really nasty lately. It is almost impossible to run a comb through and my hair has never been tangled or hard to brush. And it dries very weird and leaves spots that feel unclean or have residue on them. I am using a some other hair products so today I tried just the Organix Shampoo and Conditioner to see if it was them. I don't have a problem with the shampoo and my hair seems to feel nice after using it and it smells good. The conditioner though doesn't cover well. I have short hair and I have to use so much just to cover all my head. I let it sit for a few minutes like I do with my conditioners so it soaks up. Then when I rinsed it out my hair felt almost sticky. It was hard to run my fingers through and didn't feel conditioned at all.

Smelled nice.  So I'm surprised that this made my hair feel the opposite of smooth ~ &quot;gritty&quot; and &quot;crunchy&quot; (even while still wet).

My first purchase among the Organix line was the Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner, and Brazilian Keratin Therapy shampoo and conditioner.. and this Organix Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo (and the Conditioner) are my holy grail!

This stuff actually tames my minor frizz and makes it smell so wonderful. The shampoo one is a bit more drying than the other shampoos in the Organix line, but once you condition your hair it comes out silky and smooth.

So I'm tossing this and switching. Original review is below.

I use this with the corresponding shampoo. My hair is thick with a fine texture. I get a lot of flyaways and my hair is never quite as smooth as I want it. Also, because it is winter I deal with two dueling hair conditions--dry ends and greasy roots and bangs (I wash my hair at night). Accordingly, I like this conditioner for two reasons: first, it does help eliminate the dryness some but prevents my roots and bangs from being super greasy when I wake up in the morning. Two, I feel like it keeps my hair really soft. The smell and texture of the conditioner is great and the smell does linger (in a good way). All in all, this works well enough for my hair, though I'm still seeking my HG smoothing product.",Shea Butter Conditioner
2010-08,4.0,I like this product because it leaves my hair feeling soft and conditioned without letting it get weighed down which is good since my hair is almost to  my waist now. It has a nice smell that isn't too overpowering unlike the passionfruit guava one I also tried.

2010-08,2.0,"I've previously used the coconut Organix, and should have learned my lesson. While these products promise a lot and they do smell great and have cute packaging - they just don't deliver. The shea butter products seemed okay at first. After shampooing, my hair was extremely tangled and felt stripped - but after the conditioner, it felt silky and soft. I didn't notice any particular &quot;smoothing&quot; ability though. After about 2 weeks' use, my hair was dried out with frizz and I gave these to my husband to finish them up. My hair tends to be somewhat dry, and I only wash about twice a week. These might be okay if you have oily hair and only wash once a week, but if your hair is at all dry or has any damage - avoid. The shampoo strips your hair and the conditioner isn't hydrating enough to recover it. Won't repurchase.",Shea Butter Conditioner

The reason for me is:-  the conditioners are just not conditioning at all.  With the conditioner on my hair I couldn’t get the comb through my hair.  It just seems they have no detangling or moisturising properties at all.  These products smell absolutely amazing and lure you in, but I would not recommend any of them for people who like moist/slippery conditioners that comb through well and leave the hair actually conditioned when dry.

2010-08,2.0,"I have very long (hip length) curly hair, and am always on the lookout for a good moisturizing conditioner.

When I used it, it seemed thick and creamy but when my hair started to try it was clear it didn't do a good job of moisturizing. 

The package is pretty small and the price is kind of steep for a drugstore hair product in such a small package. 

It smells really good though! I say that if you have good luck with silicones and don't mind the price, give it a try.

I have fine, wavy hair that is damaged due to coloring and needs to be washed every other day.   After I used this, my waves were soft and noticable for once, not frizzy and dry!

Just like with the coconut conditioner, I go back and forth between using this as a daily conditioner or occasionally using a dollop (about dime sized) as a leave in. It works great for both! 

It is a bit expensive for a drugstore brand, especially for the size of the bottle, but totally worth it. The only other downside is that the bottle is kind of awkward to hold, and can slip out of your hand kind of easily. Other than that, great buy! ",Shea Butter Conditioner

After shampooing my hair with the Organix Shea Butter Shampoo (which was decent,) I applied a normal amt. of this conditioner.

Much to my disappointment the conditioner disappeared after application - no joke, it sunk right into my hair leaving my hair feeling totally dry.  I thought that maybe either I didn't add enough, or because it was so thick that it didn't spread all over, so I tried adding more.  Nope, that just sunk in too.  Worst conditioner ever.

I am always drawn to the ingredients of this brand's shampoos and conditioners because they are SLS-free and have a variety of oils and extracts. But every time I am disappointed.

",Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo
2016-08,4.0,"I am a sucker for anything coconut scented.  Was longing to try this but had to wait for a sale, it's just too expensive to pay regular price for a shampoo in my opinion.  And as cute as the bottle is I really don't care for any shampoo / conditioner that doesn't position the cap at the bottom so you can get all of the product out.  Having said that, the shampoo itself is lovely.  It has a very creamy thick texture, and despite being sulfate free, it lathers well and smells terrific.  No matter what shampoo I use, I always wash twice (because I only wash my hair twice a week) and follow with conditioner.  This is pretty comparable to many other shampoos I've used, not particularly exceptional on its own except for the scent (yes, I really am a coconut junkie).

I am on the fence about repurchasing this product, solely based on the packaging because I hate not being able to get all of the product out.  The fact that the cap is rounded means I can't really store this upside down without it tipping over so inevitably there will be some unfortunate wasted product.",Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo

My hair has never been so dry and brittle in my life! The conditioner is very light so if you like a thicker conditioner, this is not for you! The shampoo does lather very well. 

Pros: The smell absolutely amazing.

Cons: Completely dried out my hair, the conditioner is very light and it doesn't detangle or moisturize at all. ",Quenching Coconut Curls Shampoo

This last round of highlighting has really changed my hair texture and made it incredibly dry and straw-like (criessss). I wanted something cheap, sulfate free and most importantly cruelty free that would leave my hair soft and moisturized -- this is it! I couldn't believe a shampoo could make my hair soft, but as soon as you start massaging it into your scalp, you can feel how soft your strands start to feel. I use this in tandem with the matching conditioner (which is also amazing). Scent is a citrusy coconutty smell that eventually fades, but I don't find it to be offensive or cloying. I have to blow dry my hair now during the winter because it gets too cold going to bed with a head full of wet hair, but this works really well with a blow dryer and my hair ends up drying really silky and smooth.

2016-08,4.0,"Overall, this is a pretty cool and unique product.  My hair is thick and dry with natural waves.  I recently stopped straightening it and am experimenting with products to enhance the natural texture.  I bought this on a desperate, humid day when my hair was a frizz ball.  

I tried working it through my dry, frizzy hair.  It didn't spread, it just made my hair feel even more fried and sticky in the patches that the product stuck.  It looked very matted and dull.  I couldn't wait to wash it out and was going to toss this.

I tried it again one day on damp hair.  The products spread much more easily.  I noticed that my hair felt thicker even when wet (not something I usually like).  I twisted pieces, threw it in a clip and let it dry.  When I took my hair down, it was in fact much thicker than normal, but my waves were more crimped and had a cool look to them.  No frizz, but not shiny either.  It was just really cool textured, surfer inspired hair.  

This did not give me great 2nd day hair.  The healthier parts of my hair that aren't bleached held a bit of the texture.  The drier parts of my hair were huge, matted and the frizziest I've ever seen it.  I looked like a mental patient.  Spraying in some water and then twisting into a bun revived things.  

This is also great for a messy bun - It gives it that rougher texture.

A lot of silicone-based products seem to cause acne for me.  The natural wax and moisturizing ingredients in this do not bother my skin. 

If you are looking for glossy, defined waves, this might not be the product. Also, this did not work at all for me in dry hair, but it plays beautifully with water.   I'm excited to experiment with it some more.",Moroccan surf paste

I have fine, thin hair that also manages to frizz like crazy, and this paste has become my go-to finishing step before leaving the house. I take a teeny amount of the paste and rub it between my palms and then run my palms over my hair. BAM - no frizz. My hair stays frizz-free and soft for hours and I smell like a mermaid. And even though the paste is matte and promises a matte finish, my hair looks much shinier when I use it. Probably because it blocks out my ever-present halo of frizz?

I have curly hair.  For those of you familiar with NaturallyCurly.com, I have 3b curls.  For the rest of you, I have spiral curls similar to Keri Russell.   (It sounds a lot better than the reality of living with it!).   I'm always on the lookout for products that will make and keep my hair frizz free but define my curls without making them crunchy or weighing them down.   It's a lot to ask for since my hair has a ton of body but my actual hair strands are really fine.  I love and follow the Curly Girl method but as I'm gluten intolerant, I cannot use the Devachan products.  (They're really awesome by the way, if wheat/gluten is not an issue for you).  That's where the OGX surf paste comes in.  I apply about 2 pea-sized amounts - one to each side of my head - scrunch, let my hair air dry and I'm good to go!  (I smoosh and emulsify it in my palms before smoothing it over my damp hair.)  It is a bit sticky - they DO call it paste! :-P - but it seems to stick to my hair well enough that I don't need to wipe my hands afterward.  It gives my hair incredible soft hold and definition that lasts all day.  If I feel my curls could use reviving, I lightly spritz water on my hair (or wet my hands) and scrunch.  I'm happy to report that my curls even remain intact overnight while sleeping - though there is a soft frizz halo....

2014-08,5.0,"Alright, so Garnier's Surf Paste, I'm sorry, I mean Surfer Hair Power Putty, turned on me. And with a name like that, I'm glad to ditch it. I decided I needed something with more tack and weight but still adding texture that didn't make my hair FEEL heavy and gross. Seems impossible, but you ladies who are into your hair products have got to know what I mean by that. I tried Garnier's Pixie Play cream but holy, crap! What a fail! (I wrote a review if you're interested). Moving on!

So, the new hunt for the perfect texturizer finishing paste was on. I was almost going to buy this when I saw how cheap Pixie Play was and opted for that at first run (and that got returned pronto, I mean, like NEXT DAY turn around---here's my receipt, take this devil off my hands!). In exchange I got this. 

LOVE. IT. Smells great, works fabulous. How to describe? It's like, if KMS Hair Play Paste and old school Garnier Surf Paste were hybridized. Or how about, if FX Surf Head (a former fave) and Garnier Surf Paste got together? It's just tacky enough, finishes my ends and separates layers really beautifully and adds perfect texture. It smells so pleasant, just kind of sweet, yet clean and mild. I had a slight learning curve, you definitely don't need much at all, like two small-ish dabs to get some product on your fingers, rub into/all over your fingers to warm it up and then just work it through your ends as you like. I always just wipe off any residue on my body towel from after a shower and my hands are tack free after. Is that weird? Hey, it works. 

Anyway, sorry if that was TMI. But I really like this and I think you get a TON of product for your money, especially considering you only need a little each time you use it. Hope this helps! I'm super picky with my hair products. For the record, I have hair that is just past my shoulders in length so, it's not just for the ladies with the cute short bobs and pixies, you too, can have hair that is both flowy, yet perfectly texturized.

2013-08,4.0,"I really like this product. It gives me really nice goldilocks curls. This is a very sticky pomade that smells nice and perfumey. You have to use a very small amount of this product because if you use too much it can give your hair a sticky texture, I use just enough to thinly coat my hands in it and lightly scrunch. For this same reason I use it when my hair is slightly damp right before it's almost all dry. When I use this it helps control my frizz and holds my curls pretty well until the next wash.

I'm using this on my short almost pixie style hair to give it a texurized messy look and with such short hair its easy to use way too much. Usually I try to just dab a finger in the wax and then melt it in my palms and that is usually a good amount. Scrunching and brushing my hair back with my fingers gives the voluminous sticky-up look I'm going for while holding my bangs in place. I won't need to buy another one of these FOR AGES, because its so huge but I think if I don't find one that surpasses this and is perhaps creamier I would repurchase.",Moroccan surf paste

2016-08,4.0,"I bought this conditioner as a 'travel pack' while I was in hospital and needed to smell like something other than surgical scrub- the hospital provides this- which all but destroyed my fine, tangle-prone hair. It seemed like a pretty solid investment, I got the shampoo and conditioner in 'travel-size' and a Tangle Teezer which I had never used before and now incidentally I love. I bought this pack and then came to MUA to check other peoples reviews because I apparently like to do things out of the usual order... I was concerned, people didn't seem to like the results they got from using this conditioner and was tossing up whether to give it a go, or just return it and try something else. I persevered and used it, fully expecting a disaster of epic proportions. 

Firstly, this conditioner smells AMAZING straight from the bottle, like tropical, coconutty, juicy goodness but I found the smell didn't linger after my hair was dry, just smelled clean and fresh which is all I really need, anything to take the smell of chlorhexidine antiseptic scrub away.
Texture-wise, it is thick but a small amount goes a decent way for fine hair like mine. I hardly ever use conditioner since almost every product I have ever tried, no matter what it claims, weighs my hair down and I'm left looking like Severus Snape come lunchtime. Not so with this one. I gave it a go from roots to tips (usually a surefire way to looking like I dunked my head in a chip-fryer) to see whether it was really going to live up to the claim &quot;weightless&quot; and it did. I have lovely soft, smooth, shiny, silky hair (a lot of positive 'S' words) that looks beautifully clean and isn't a tangled mess like it almost always is. Not sure whether the new Tangle Teezer is the reason for the non-tangliness but when I wet combed it I hit zero snags or snarls which is unheard of for me. Usually if I wet-brush (or even dry brush) I find great chunks of my hair come out all sad and forlorn and broken, but I think the combination of the new brush and the conditioner is a real winner. 

Pros:
-Smells divine, not overpoweringly scented, just enough to make you feel you're somewhere tropical and not in your shower.
-A little bit goes a long way, so it should last us fine haired people ages.
-Weightless, finally a product that actually lives up to the promise and doesn't leave me looking like I've climbed out of a stick of butter. 
-Makes brushing a dream!

Cons:
-It's like $20 a bottle (for a full size) here in NZ so that's a little painful BUT I can see myself taking 6 months to get through it so it's not too bad.
-I wish the coconut smell would last a bit longer after my hair dries but I'd probably just wander around sniffing it like a huge weirdo. In which case I'm glad that it just smells clean and fresh.

I noticed reviews from curly-haired women and they said that it barely moisturizes their hair. So I don't think this is the line for you if you have curly, wavy, and/or thick hair.

2014-08,3.0,"I really wanted to do a deep conditioning treatment which is something I hadn't done in a long time.This product contains silicones which my hair negatively reacts to (I have curly hair). I used this product in 2 different ways. In the first method, I shampooed my hair, slept with the mask on, and rinsed it out the next day. But it left it really frizzy and harder to detangle and style. My hair felt like straw, but I actually liked the results when it dried. Though from day 5-7, my hair tangled &amp; frizzed up so much. In the second method, I left it in for 20 minutes and washed it out with a shampoo and styled it. This method worked perfectly. My hair was soft and smooth in the end with little frizz. But honestly, I would not repurchase this product. I've tried other hair masks which left my head full of plump moisturised curls. However, everyone's hair is different, so I would recommend that you at least try it if you're looking for a deep conditioner.

2013-08,5.0,"I am not into buying hair products for fun, especially if it has esoteric ingredients names written in big letter across the packaging. I bought this one because my hair seemed very dry this winter, and it was also on special for 4 dollars. I let it sit for about 5 minutes and followed with morocanoil as usual. My hair is SO SOFT. There is no more dry strand flying around. It's the second time I use it in two weeks, and I will definitely buy more of it if it's on sale! If you have color treated, fine to medium hair, I recommended it.",Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask
2013-08,5.0,"Fabulous hair mask!!!! I love the whole entire Awapuhi Ginger line by Organix! I have tried the Organix Macadamia Oil mask before and hated it. Once my hair was dry it felt dry, brittle, and tangled up. The Awapuhi Ginger mask is 100 x's better. It actually FEELS like a mask. It left my hair soft and silky. Absolutely recommend!!!",Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask
2012-08,3.0,"Picked this up on a whim at the drugstore. Haven't used any hair masks before, but I expected more. This isn't more effective than a conditioner if you put it on for about 3 minutes. I tried putting it on for 20 min like it says on the container today, and my hair does feel lovely and soft and manageable, but it's still underwhelming for the price. Smells fantastic though, but after I finish my tub I won't be buying again",Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask

I get good results leaving my regular masque on for this long. It was nowhere near the way I expected it to be and was nowhere near as good as my regular.

2012-08,2.0,"I'm not usually a fan of Organix products and this conditioning mask is no different. First, let me say that I do like the Organix Moroccan Oil line. This product, however, did not leave my hair in any better condition than say...White Rain conditioner. Seriously, this is supposed to be a moisturizing mask. My hair felt super dry and tangled after leaving this mask on for 10 minutes. My hair doesn't feel or look repaired whatsoever. I used up the whole product just because of principal but I will not repurchase. Two products from Organix that are absolute 
gold  are the Moroccan Oil Condiyioner and the styling oil. All of their other products are drying and damaging in my opinion.",Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask
2012-08,5.0,"Organix is one of my favorite drugstore lines. I especially like the yummy smelling Awapuhi Ginger products, which includes this super hydrating treatment mask. After shampooing, I work this mask through wet hair and leave it on for 3-5 minutes while I finish my shower. It rinses easily and leaves my hair feeling nourished; not weighed down. For extremely dry and/or damaged hair, you can up the conditioning factor by covering your hair with a shower cap and keeping the treatment on for 20 minutes.  ",Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Instant Recovery Mask
2016-08,5.0,"At first I thought this was too heavy, but once I learned how to apply it for my hair, I fell in love. I already really like the entire OGX Argan Oil line, and I use the shampoo/conditioner on a rotating basis with some of their other lines. I also use the Argan Oil Intense Hydrating Treatment once a week to deep condition, so if you enjoy that, this is one step up condition wise. I don't usually like tub containers but this is easy enough to open, and there is plenty in there to last a while. 

I typically shampoo and condition, leaving my hair clipped up to rinse after I do everything else. Once I wash my conditioner out, I grab two fingertips worth of this, work it through my hands, and then run it through the bottom 3/4's of my hair. I leave this in and pat my hair dry with a towel, add hair oil, brush through, add curl cream and style. Obviously it isn't an HG that lets me skip other conditioners, but my 2 ft long curly hair can use all the help it can get in winter. The great smell, consistent shine and reasonable price (and sales) make this a great product in my hair arsenal.

Pros: Reasonable price (especially on sale), great smell, leaves hair shiny and soft, works well with curls and waves, good detangler, multi use. Huge amount of product for the price.

Cons: Works differently depending how you use it, so there is a learning curve. This product in particular is harder to find in stores than others in the Argan Oil line. ",Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter 
2016-08,4.0,Awesome ,Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter 
2016-08,5.0,"This product does not really do much for my hair.  But, I found a great use for it.  I keep the tub in my shower and after i turn off the water and lightly towel off (so still damp) I use this as an in-shower moisturizer.  It is fantastic.  a small amount covers a large area.  It soaks in but leaves my skin super smooth.  It does not have a strong scent, which i prefer so it does not clash with my fragrance.  Once I am done I lightly towel off and that is it.  I do not need to use any extra moisturizers and my skin feels hydrated even at the end of the day.  I find that I am not needing to apply moisturizer before bed.   It is very economical (about $12.50) for a tub that will last a long time and can be found everywhere here in the US (CVS, Walmart, Markets, etc.).  I would recommend it as an in-shower moisturizer.  ",Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter 
2016-08,3.0,Too much for my hair. Can only use about once a month or have to clarify out. Leaves hair too soft to hold any shape or style. However as a body moisturizer new favorite. Last bit in shower rub in dry parts quick rinse and I have very soft moisturized skin ,Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter 
2016-08,4.0,"this is good stuff for the price. i love the packaging, too, because you can use as little or as much as you need. when i'm having really dry days, i leave a tiny bit in (about a dime size for my medium-length thin, fine hair). when i'm having normal days, i wash it out. (i have thin hair, so most days i wash it out.) for a drugstore brand, this is great stuff and smells lovely (medium-depth floral). make sure not to leave the lid off for any length of time, or the product will start drying and yellowing. ",Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter 
2016-08,5.0,"This Hair Butter is not available in Asia countries, I bought mine via online and shipped from Wilmington, USA. 
This is my third favourite OGX (Organix) products - first is, coconut milk shampoo and conditioner and second is Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil. This Hair Butter has a unique name, creamy Hair Butter (in 187g, in a tub which is fully filled), which it delivers its promise by hydrating dry hair and works wonderfully well before and after I flat iron my hair. It smells similar to OGX Penetrating Argan Oil  Serum and nothing irritating or overpowering and it is a plus that its texture is really buttery and smooth to spread, exactly in a heavy butter cream based and nothing waxy like a hair wax or Egyptian Magic Cream.
Let me mention abit of the background cum history of my hair. I am an Asian who used to dye my hair alot and I had chemically straightened my hair which caused it burnt (due to leaving in more than its recommended time) and my hair ended up dry, brittle and crinkled. Ever since that incident, my hair never returns to its original healthy condition. I do not have the black, smooth and sleek hair which everyone jealous about for being an Asian. I have to flat iron my hair almost everyday to keep them tamed and eliminate the annoying frizz. Using hair oil when my hair is towel dried is a must and thereafter to apply another layer of cream or serum for heat resistant before I start using flat iron. You can most probably imagine how dry and how bad my hair is. My hair will only be presentable and I can have a good hair day after these multiple application.  Well, a single serum/oil sometimes will not work incredibly well enough to calm my frizz and keep it moistures for at least, one day.
A little remind that this Hair Butter contains mineral oil which I think some people would like to avoid using it. I used to avoid using and buying any serums, oils that contain mineral oil after reading all the negative comments and there are many salon exclusive and famous brands that contain good oils and vega ingredients (sesame, walnut oil, famous in Japan brand hair oil, olive, sunflower, argan, camelia, soybean, macadamia, grapeseed, coconut oil with acid amino to repair and hydrate hair ends to prevent split end) on top of the ingredient lists. I am somehow very attracted by this Hair Butter and willing to give it a try that it can do a good job and not like those water-gel based cream, gelee which only suit fine hair and the effect only lasts for a few hours and the frizz returns. I miss Garnier Sleek and Shine Cream which makes me astonished after seeing its effect on my hair. But this product is hard to get and seems like only available in eBay or other online shopping which does not ship to my country. But with this new lovely Hair Butter, it without any hesitation, can replace my old love!
I will only use this Hair Butter for leave in purpose and it will last for months and worth every single cents that I have paid. No regret in buying and if you have dry coarse hair, you might want to give it a try  but do not over using it for your first few attempts, as it makes your hair oily and you might end up rewash your hair. I have tried and tested this Hair Butter by going to a hot and humid place, with fans blowing everywhere and no finger combing or combing my hair to keep in tidy and after 2 hours, I return home and my hair, surprisingly, is kempt and not crazily frizzing like a mad chick which it used to be! Will buy this product again even if I need to wait for weeks for its arrival!!! Do  give it a try if you are a product maniac like me and have tried out most of the high end products but you still cannot find the so-called &quot;You're the one!&quot;.",Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter 
2015-08,2.0,"The super positive reviews on this product outside of MUA made me buy it. Unfortunately, I am the first person reviewing this product in MakeUpAlley.. which in my opinion has the most reliable reviews.

Anyway, this product does not live up to its promises. When using it as a deep treatment in the shower, your hair can get super heavy and dull, and when using a very small amount, it does not bring desirable results either. Very poor performance. Definitely not usable as a deep treatment, no matter how much or how little you use. 

Using it as a leave in is much better from my experience, but still the results are very mediocre. The ends are crunchy yet greasy. And beware... if you use it on almost dry hair be ready for a greasy mess. You know what the main problem with this product is? THE TERRIBLE THICK FILM it leaves on your hair.... wanna know the name? BEESWAX! I should've known! Why would they put beeswax in this?!?

I mean, the scent is nice, the conditioner is very THICK as a butter (duh :D) but I honestly see no use for this. My hair is not even damaged, it just tends to get dry. This is supposed to be pure moisture and contains no protein whatsoever. If it was very mediocre with my hair, I honestly can't tell what it would do with your hair if you love heat or dyes.

All in all I find organix products to be VERY MEDIOCRE and it's a shame that you can get much better hair with herbal essences or dove. What's the organic thing in these products if they have effing BEESWAX? Heck, even herbal essences silicones are water soluble. 

Sad, because the packaging of this is beautiful. Don't fall for the marketing ladies. Not going to spend a penny in organix products anymore. Completely disappointed ????",Argan oil of morocco creamy hair butter 
2016-08,5.0,"Total steal compared to the Moroccan hair care brand. Leave in for a few minutes and rinse. Safe for color treated hair, long hair and doesn't leave your hair greasy. My hair feels and looks luxurious and won't go back to traditional conditioner. ",Renewing Argan Oil of Morocco Intensive Moisturizing Treatment
2016-08,4.0,"I found this on clearance at Walgreens, and now that I did, I hope it's not being discontinued. 

First off, I like the scent. It's a bit floral, and while I'm not wild about a lot of fragrances, I find this pleasant. 

The texture is like a cream, and adding it to my hair, it feels like adding a bit of conditioner rather than some volume boosting product. My hair is on the fine side, dry with some wave/frizz/curl, and a bit of this doesn't weigh it down, which is a relief. I've so far only tried it on dry hair, for a bit of definition and boost, and it does add a bit of shine, tame some frizz and make my hair look a bit fuller, all without making my hair feel like it has a bunch of sticky or crunchy product on it.  

It's not a miracle in a bottle, but I can actually see myself using this up, which is in itself a minor miracle. ",Bamboo Fiber-Full Thickening Fiber Cream
2016-08,5.0,"O hell yes!!!  HG alert!!  I miss the 80s - I like big bouncy hair!  This stuff gives me the same bouncy volume that Living Proof Full Thickening Cream and Living Proof Perfect Hair Day give me = volume, bounce/movement, some shine, not too stiff that lasts most of the day (ie 10+ hours w/ hairspray of course). 


LP is expensive, so for the past several months, I have been using a Tresseme combo (Max the Volume Root Lifting Cream on my roots and Youth Boost Emulsion Spray everywhere else) which gives me GREAT volume, but rather stiff (thing Mama Minion), but I was OK w/ that.


Then, I saw this stuff on sale at Target w/ no reviews on MUA, but I decided to take a chance and WOW - this stuff rocks!  I still have some LP product and a couple of weeks ago, I did LP on a Monday and this stuff on a Tuesday, didn't change anything else in my routine and had identical results!  Me VERY happy!


I notice no build-up, smell is nice and not overpowering at all.

2016-08,1.0,I used this spray to try and combat my dry frizzy ends and this did nothing for my hair. It smelled very sweet and this treatment made my hair feel sticky.

2014-08,3.0,"I tried two a leave in cream and a spray.
The cream was heavy, weighed my hair down, and made it tangled.

It makes my hair smell good, nothing too strong or overwhelming.

2014-08,4.0,"I've been using this for several weeks now and there has been a noticeable improvement to my hair. My hair went through a phase of being very dry and frizzy. Recently, as I started using this product, people have been commenting on how silky and healthy it's looking, and my boyfriend loves the smell. I've been using this together with the Moroccan oil, which would also be a factor for the improvement in my hair. But overall quite happy with this product! ",Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk
2014-08,2.0,"I wanted to love this because I love the shampoo and conditioner, and I love the smell, but I don't.  I kinda hate it.  I ran out of my garnier fructis curl sculpting cream stuff and bought this thinking it would be great.

You have to use a ton, it doesn't spread evenly because it's crazy thick, and if you don't get it just right in your hair, it leaves it stiff and chunky feeling.  So thick but doesn't spread and you have to use a ton just are a horrible combo.  Not to mention it doesn't do much for sculpting your waves.  I just don't like it.

I'm going to stick with Garnier Fructis stuff in the tube.  That stuff is amazing!",Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk
2013-08,5.0,"I cannot begin to explain how much I love this product. It's probably the most amazing leave in conditioner that I have ever used, not only because it smells amazing, but also the long term effects on my hair. Having dry, regularly dyed hair split ends and frizz is inevitable. What I love most about this product is how it not only reverses this issue, but I can also use as much as I want/need! The bottle says to only use a few sprays but I go ahead and use 6+ on towel dried, damp hair. It doesn't weigh your hair down

I don't wash my hair everyday, so if needed I'll just spray some here/there on dry hair and I'm good to go!

Pros:
- Super amazing scent
- Weightless, doesn't weigh hair down or turn you into a grease slick
- Use on either damp or dry hair
- Smooths frizz, tames ends
- Leaves hair soft and manageable
- Great for adding moisture in-between washes
- 1 bottle lasts for ages (approx 2 months if using it religiously)

Cons:
- Packaging sometimes leaks if on its side - so not fun to travel with :(

Out of the overwhelming number of options in the store's haircare section, I chose to purchase this product because of the pleasant scent and inexpensive price tag of $6.

I am so glad that I decided to purchase this!  It makes my naturally straight/fine hair super shiny and silky to the touch, if not even more than It's A 10.  It does not make my hair greasy either!  The fact that I've had such great results when using this during the colder weather season (when my hair is typically the driest during the year) impresses me even more and assures me that this Nourishing Milk really was a great find.",Coconut Milk Leave In Nourishing Milk
2013-08,5.0,"i think this is the 2nd best thing I've ever purchased for my hair, after the Dove Nutritive Therapy - Nourishing Care Serum. 

I use this just after my shower, before i brush my hair and it is amazing. my hair is almost completely detangled and so conditioned -  not to mention the absolute amazing smell. i usually can wait a few days to wash my hair -  so if i wash it monday night, u can usually wait until wednesday night or thursday, depending on what im doing. during this time i use the conditioning milk every morning and night, only on my ends, and i've never had my ends look so good with prolonged colouring around 7 years worth. 

i almost forgot this stuff lasts for ages, smell wise and length of product. my hair never smells of anything other than coconut &amp; i only repurchase around every 2-3 months using 3-4 sprays every use (6-8 per day).

It was displayed close to the check out counter and I grabbed it along with a couple of chap-sticks to equal out to the ten bucks.  I tend to love anything &quot;coco-nutty&quot; so I knew I would probably love the smell at least.  What I didn't expect was how great my hair felt after using this. It was soft and shiny and very tame.  Normally this time of year with the humidity my hair can be a frizzy yucky mess.

* PROS
- Really nice, sweet coconut smell that lingers even overnight. Also covers up the smell from other hair products like hairspray.
- Easy to apply and evenly distribute through hair, comes in a spray bottle.
- Good consistency, like water. Doesn't feel like you have anything in your hair at all.
- Leaves my hair really soft and shiny.

* CONS
- Really poor packaging, if I tip the bottle to the side even slightly liquid just pours out. I have no idea how I got it home in my bag in the first place. Might just be a fault with my bottle, I'm not sure.

2010-08,3.0,"I have bought this stuff a second time, which I almost never do, ESPECIALLY with hair products. But when I do, it means I really do like it. I gave this a 3 out of 5 because I really do like it, but I don't know if it does a lot for my hair. It's like a very subtle hair perfume (it makes it smell great and lasts all day), with very subtle effects on my hair, but I still like it a lot.

I think the highest selling point of this stuff is the smell. It smells a pina colada, but not in a tacky way. It smells like real coconut. Besides that, on my thick blonde hair, it leaves it soft and silky. It also de-frizzes and de-poofs my hair, but not a lot.

I usually use this right out of the shower. I towel dry it, comb it and then spray this all over and brush/comb through and put HealthySexyHair Soy Renewal argan oil and Paul Mitchell Super Skinny smoothing serum and let my hair air dry. Without using the leave-in nourishing milk, my hair gets poofier (that usual) and frizz that doesn't go away with more hair products.

PROS: smell, defrizzes, depoofs, lightweight, makes hair silky, did I mention that it smells really good?

CONS: almost $6.00, really watery, doesn't feel like it soaks in

What I love most about it is that it doesn't make my hair poofy. I had been using a creme from the John Frieda brilliant brunette line, however that only agreed with me when the weather was a certain way. If it was too cold out, my hair felt drier. I don't have that problem with this. My hair stays soft to the touch regardless of climate.

It's light and non-greasy, and I love the coconut smell, but I don't think it does much to my hair other than give it that nice scent.  My hair doesn't look any shinier or more nourished than it did before I began to use this.  Perhaps it is affecting my hair on a microscopic level.  As for what I can see, I've used other leave-in conditioner type products that have left my hair looking more nourished.  I basically like this product, so I'll continue to use it until it runs out, but I don't like it enough to buy it again.  It costs about 7 or 8 dollars, which isn't pricey, but it's still more than I want to pay just to get my hair to smell nice.  I should also note that the bottle doesn't seem to be very leak-proof.  Unless there was some sort of shipping incident, evey bottle of this stuff at Target had leaked, and the print on the lables was running.  The other Organix products were fine.

2015-08,3.0,"This shampoo did nothing for me.  True, it didn't strip my color, but that's the only positive thing I can say about it.  It didn't hydrate my hair at all or have any noticeable benefit whatsoever.  I'm simply not impressed with it at all.  I have discovered a sulfate free brand that I much prefer: Shea Moisture.  I love the Manuka Honey and the Tahitian Noni formulas as well as the Raw Shea Butter formula.  The honey formula is very hydrating so it's best for dry, damaged hair.  The Raw Shea formula is also moisturizing, but perhaps a bit less so than the honey one.  The Tahitian Noni formula is hydrating as well and works well on frizz.  The SM conditioners are wonderful as well, as are the masks.  I use the honey or shea mask for 45 minutes or so with a heat cap every two weeks or so.  They work really well and the effects last through several shampoos.  I can definitely tell a difference when I use SM products whereas I never noticed anything positive about Organix products.  So if you want a sulfate free poo that really does what it claims, then try SM.  It's a bit more expensive than Organix, but well worth it.  I ended up pitching my Organix shampoos.  My hair needs TLC and they did nothing for me.  I definitely don't recommend this shampoo.  Try SM instead.",Kukui Oil Shampoo

It felt really hydrating and soft in my hair and so did the matching conditioner. The conditioner also had pretty good slip so I was surprised that these two products made my hair feel a bit hard and tangled after rinsing. Although these products helped with my frizz and didn't dry out my hair, They definitely didn't give my hair the softness and manageability that I was hoping for.  I won't be repurchasing these again.

Update 6/19/2017: I've tried Organix shampoos and conditioners in the past and was not impressed. I found the shampoos of this line to be very drying and the conditioners did not have much slip so I was kind of reluctant to give this brand another try. I tried the Kukui oil shampoo and conditioner in the past and wasn't very impressed. But after a few years I was intrigued by the launch of new organix products so I decided to give the Kukui oil line another try and I'm glad I did. For one thing the Kukui oil line must have been reformulated because the scent color and texture are completely different than I remember.The shampoo is very thick and creamy and to my surprise was a very moisturizing. The shampoo is sulfate free and lathers very nicely and thoroughly cleanses my hair without stripping it. The conditioner is also great. It is very thick and has amazing slip.

2013-08,5.0,"Listen up Y'all.
I've got thick, curly, long hair. The thing is with thick, curly, long hair is that it is a bitch to take care of. For years I switched shampoo and conditioner constantly because my hair was still a frizzy mess after every bottle. And then I saw this little beauty (well, not this one specifically, but the same brand), sitting on the bottom shelf, out-shined by the Pantene and the Garnier and the L'oreal Kids. From day 1, my hair was softer-- We're not talking perfect, but better-- and the longer I kept with it, the more the curls became defined and soft and bouncy. 
I've been using this brand faithfully for 4 years. I don't even have to cut my hair anymore because I don't get split ends. At all. We're talkin' zero; and if you have curly hair, you know what a big deal that is. With this, all I have to do is shower and comb my hair, and the hair just dries into a nice cascade of curls. But this is after 4 YEARS. You can't expect overnight instant glam, people. No shampoo will give you that; but this will repair your damaged hair as much as possible, and keep the new growth healthy. 
The smell is an absolutely wonderful floral that is faint on the hair, but if you have your hair up and then take it down you will release wafts of floral like you had just come from rolling in a pile of flowers, and people will flock to you to smell your hair. I'm not kidding. You're gonna make some friends just because your hair smells nice.
You're gonna get more creaminess than lather; but really, people, lather isn't always a good thing. Lather comes from sulfates. Sulfates aren't great for your hair. Capisce?
Speaking of sulfates, when I first started using this, they were completely sulfate free. Now I see they've added a sulfate in the ingredients, which disappoints me, but I'm guessing they got sick of people complaining about not having lather. I have not, however, seen any difference in how this shampoo cares for my hair. If anything, it's better. If having a &quot;no sulfate&quot; shampoo is really, really important to you, I understand-- but this is as close as you're gonna get for a drugstore product. 
I have one problem with the bottle, and that's that you cant see how much is left. There's no way to remove the cap, so you're just forced to guesstimate based on how loud the bottle's shart noises are as you work your way to the bottom. But it's a great size; easy to hold with one hand. 
In short, go out. Buy yourself a couple bottles. Take care of your hair. It'll do the rest. ", Repairing Awapuhi Ginger Shampoo

2012-08,1.0,"A lot of you think this shampoo is sulfate free . But you need to do your research . There are still surfactants in this . The 2nd one SODIUM c14 olefin sulfontate is a very harsh surfactant -- equally as if not MORE harsh than SLS--. It's no wonder that after just one use my hair color seems faded .  . No wonder this shampoo foams so well. The other surfactants in here are gentle . It has a water soluble silicone which is nice and doesn't make my hair tangled like the clear scalp therapy shampoo 
But I'm giving this shampoo A bad rap. You can't believe all the claims written on the bottles. Sulfate free doesn't mean safe for colored hair or free or harsh detergents . You might want to re think this if you have colored hair . A shame. Because it smells nice and makes my hair clean and light weight without being dry. 
To be fair I'll keep using it for a few weeks and if I notice any color fading I'll definitely know it's the 'poo and quit it, and go on to joico, who in addition to using the gentle surfactants, uses sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) which is a gentle surfactant that cleans rather well W/O being drying or stripping.

I dye my hair w/ permanent color at home every month and recently had an episode that necessitated the use of ColorOops!

I did a lot of research here on MUA and this was one of the few drugstore brands that was sulfate free and got high marks for cleansing and repair.  I bought both the shampoo and conditioner at Walgreen's, BOGO free, pretty sweet deal for an $8 shampoo &amp; conditioner! Love the scent, mild and pretty and love how the shampoo lathers so well, I think, even though it's sulfate free it lathers enough to cleanse properly.

2015-08,2.0,"Ok so I've tried multiple kinds of the organix shampoos AND conditioners. Every single bottle, the cap broke off after like the second use. I do not care for them at all. They leave my hair limp lifeless and greasy. I have long blonde hair that is fine (for reference) they do not add of their claimed benefits to my hair.

2015-08,4.0,"I am on my second bottle of this conditioner. I have to admit, I mainly purchase Ogx conditioners for how delicious some of them smell. My first obsession was Repairing Awapuhi Ginger, followed by Hydrate +Defrizz Kukui Oil but I think this one is by far my favourite. It smells very fresh, doesn't linger and gives my fine blonde brittle hair just enough hydration to give it movement. It's suitable for frequent use as it's not rich enough to leave residue buildup in your hair. Overall, I'd say all Ogx conditioners have the same degree of just-there hydration and detangling but you really have to tailor them to your hair's needs. Awapuhi is definitely suitable in increasing hair elasticity but won't do much for detangling or smoothing. Kukui will leave hair mega smooth and shiny but it has tendency to build up. This one is most balanced and suitable for managing my split ends and extreme tangling. It airs dry my hair straight and holds a curl nicely. Ogx is inexpensive to begin with but almost always on sale; a bottle is nice and narrow so it won't take much space. The lid fits tightly but easy to flip open with a thumb. By the way, shampoo smells almost like nothing at all so I opted for Quenched Sea Mineral Moisture shampoo.",Healing Vitamin E

My hair looked and felt very soft and healthy with this shampoo. It smelled fruity and wonderful and I loved the bright pink bottle. I have somewhat wavy hair and this did not straighten it out too much or make my hair too poofy, which a lot of products do.

2013-08,4.0,It's interesting to me that this product has really mixed reviews. I guess it just goes to show that everyone's body and hair react differently. This was my first time trying Organix. I found it on clearance at Wal-Mart. I had a pleasant experience with this product from scent to the way it left my hair feeling afterwards. I feel like it gave me a nice clean wash. I didn't think it dried my hair out. I really enjoy my hair the next days after using this.

I just can't get past the SUPER STRONG SCENT of this shampoo. Basically it smells like you just dunked your head in a bowl of Kool-Aid/Fruit Punch/PixieStix mixture. I am unable to go around like that all day. The fragrance probably gets a bit stronger in the shower under hot steamy water, but I immediately had to wash my hair three times with the only other shampoo within reach (dandruff control) just to get most of the smell out.",Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo

2011-08,5.0,"Why You will LOVE It:

The acai berry avocado shampoo and conditioner has an exotic nutrient luxurious blend of antioxidant rich acai berry extract and guava to instantly nourish &amp; enrich your hair while avocado proteins add nutrition and balance along with Moroccan argan oil to moisturize your tresses and create a shiny, smooth, frizz-free finish. The shampoo &amp; conditioner are sulfate free, paraben free and they are organic! This product is safe for color-treated hair and is safe for all hair types.

For reference, I have damaged, dry, thick and noncolored hair. I have my hair BKT 6 months ago and I started using Organix Acai-Berry Avocado Shampoo and suddenly fell in love with.

It has an amazing scent and makes me happier while taking shower. Lathers very nice and it cleans hair and scalp very well.

In my opinion trick here is using shampoo and conditioner together. You should use them together to get better results

If you live in Europe or USA, it has a very reasonble price unlike Northern Cyprus and Turkey. So you probably won't complain about the price since a bottle is 20 € in Northern Cyprus and Turkey. However you need to use more product to clean your hair beacuse it is sulfate free. Organix won't foam like a SLS shampoo. This is the only complaint I can make. It runs out very fast :)))

Your hair will love this treat.

Will def keep buying this one.",Acai Berry Avocado Shampoo
2010-08,4.0,"Okay first of all I think this may have been reformulated or the person below me got a bad bottle. I don't notice any &quot;pulpy&quot; texture at all? It's just creamy and smooth like any other shampoo. It smells wonderful, so fruity-- very &quot;berry&quot;. The lather is FANTASTIC considering this is a sulfate free shampoo. Most of the sulfate free shampoos I try are thin, runny, and don't have much lather. This lathers up a treat! 

The only reason this is a 4 out of 5 is because it's not quite as moisturizing (&quot;moisturous&quot;? wtf @ review below me) as you would think a shampoo containing avocado and argan oil would be. However I would call this more of a 4.5 than a 4. 

Anyways, hair is left feeling clean, and my scalp likes it. I have very sensitive skin on my scalp so a shampoo that doesn't aggravate it is always a winner. As far as my hair type, it's fine but I have a lot of it, I color, and it's what I would call &quot;normal&quot;-- not particularly dry or oily.

It made my hair feel neither better nor worse. Maybe a little softer but certainly no marked change. I wanted to be fair so I used it twice more. Still nothing.

While it isn't the most moisturizing treatment I have ever used, it doesn't dry out my hair or leave my hair with static or frizzy ends. It gives just enough moisture if that makes sense. I noticed better results when I leave it in more  (I'd say for ten to fifteen minutes). The only thing I can really complain about is that it comes in a jar and it makes it difficult for me to use in the shower since I hate to get any water in it.

2013-08,5.0,"FINALLY, an HG curl defining product! The search has ended, ladies. I am picky about what products I put in my hair, mostly because my hair is picky about which products it will accept (it truly has a mind of its own)! I have thick, wavy middle eastern hair that if left to its own devices, will go every which way- undefined, &quot;blah&quot; waves and little definition. I don't use any other hair products as long as I have this gem on hand. After washing my hair and squeezing out excess water, I use a little bit (little goes a long way) on damp hair, scrunching my hair till I get the desired look. After air drying, I'm left with beautiful, soft, nicely defined waves that feel natural and light, not at all crunchy or weighed down. The trick is to only use as much as you need for your hair type and length, and not more. An added bonus is the incredible scent, which lasts and is not too heavily perfumed or artificial, and the light, lotion-like consistency. I also love that my hair still feels okay the day after, so I can wash my hair out every other day without feeling like it's too dirty/sticky/grimy like with some other hair products.

Inital thoughts..smells good, starts off like a pudding consistency but thins out quickly once it is mixed with water or put onto the hair. (for my long hair I need quite a bit to cover all of it and even then it is not coated well)
Product does not have much slip if any at all. In order to receive any conditioning benefit I have to use a lot of product and leave at least 3-5 minutes, also in order to have any smoothng effect I need to apply high on my head starting above the ears. 
It did hydrate my hair but did not offer any detangling. 
The first couple of days I noticed my hair seemed a bit weighed down but not too bad, and at first it did NOTHING for frizz. 
After two weeks my hair is no longer weighed down, even though I am now using more product, and it has helped to smooth down some of the frizz. It has not eliminated it by any means but I am ok with the overall result. I do not even need a smoothing product anymore, whatever frizz is left I can smooth out with the blowdyer and brush. 
Over time my hair looked healthier and shiny BUT because of the tangles my hair is now breaking due to brushing it out. So it was counteracting the benefits. 
Overall I will not repurchase because for the price and size of the bottle I have to use way too much of this on my hair and due to the tangles it is causing more damage, even though my hair was soft and shiny :(.

It does build up a bit after a couple days, but nevertheless; it works really well at moisturizing and leaving hair soft. I always like to combine leave-in creams with serums. I was using one with argon oil ( Proclaim argon oil serum ) but noticed argon oil darkened my natural hair. I found at Sally's Hair Chemist Coconut Oil Hair Serum and bought it.

The only problem with this product is that when my hair was dryer it was not moisturizing enough.

However, after a few weeks of news, nothing else changed and the split ends seemed to be getting worse instead of better. In fact, my hair started to feel coated and gross. I finally tossed it, and started to use Tresemme in place of the Organix and it works a lot better.

2011-08,5.0,"THIS STUFF IS A MIRACLE WORKER!
I bought this product because I had really wanted to try coconut oil, but thought it would probably be to heavy for my hair, so I got this instead as I had liked the organix coconut deep conditioner. I wasn't expecting a product that would &quot;mend split ends&quot; because no product can do that, I just wanted something that would make my hair smooth and smell nice. But OMG was I impressed!! Lately (past few months) my hair has been getting REALLY tangled and knotted all over after a few hours of doing it. It didn't matter if I curled my hair or straightened it or anything, but I was getting these massive rats nests that would take literally 20 minutes to brush out and were the biggest pain in the butt. After just 1 use of this product, I have NO tangles WHAT SO EVER. NONE. I can't even explain how happy I am! My hair stays smooth and knot free the whole day!!! I LOVE it and can't explain enough how much this has helped with preventing split ends as the knots would often break my hair, as well as keeping my hair looking nice. I don't ever want to stop using this because my hair will go back to looking so knotted and messy.
Bottom line, this product isn't going to mend split ends (nothing will), but I would for sure recommend this to anyone who needs help taming and smoothing hair! :)",Coconut Milk Split End Mender

I cut off my split ends at a salon whenever I get my hair cut and I wanted a split end mender just to prevent split ends. This might work for that, but I'm not sure yet.

I was very pleased with it, i have been using it since February and it has done more then i thought it would have done. not only did it give protection from split ends but it also made my hair very smooth and have a healthy shine to it.  many say to only use on pump or else it will get greasy. it does do that, i accidentally used to much on my bangs and they became a little greasy, but i have to use three or more pumps because i have a LOT of hair. so i just stay clear of running it through my bangs untill the end when i have a little left over on my hands. but over a really good product to by even though it was a little expensive for a poor college student. but i dont care cause my hair health it just as important.",Coconut Milk Split End Mender
2011-08,1.0,"My hair is naturally very straight, fine, and a bit volume-less. I don't have oily or dry hair. I do blow dry my hair almost everyday and since I'm trying to grow my hair out, I wanted something extra to protect the ends of my hair. I've never had split-ends to my knowledge but it was something to consider because I don't plan on getting another haircut for another few months. 

Before trying this product out, I used Rusk Sensories' passionflower leave-in conditioner and sometimes i would mix in a little Biosilk and apply it on the ends of my hair when it was damp. I was hoping that this would be a cheaper alternative.

The first couple days I used this, I noticed that my hair was a lot softer. However, after a couple days of use, I noticed that my hair was incredibly dry and frizzy. It had never been this dry before and I didn't know what was causing it. I deep-conditioned it and even after, my hair was still very dry. It felt like straw. Then I realized that the only thing I changed about my hair routine was adding this product. Once I stopped using this product, my hair took about 2-3 days to get back to normal. 

The smell of this product is pretty strong. I don't generally like the smell of coconut scented products because usually it's overpowering, stuffy, and heavy. This was no different. There have been few products that I've found that are coconut scented but light and refreshing. 

I did like the packaging but because the pump is so short, it takes several pumps to get enough product out. I had really high hopes about this product because it is organic and I've heard some good things about their coconut conditioner. However, this really didn't work me.

Hope this helps you guys! ",Coconut Milk Split End Mender

2011-08,4.0,"The first time I used this, I felt like it really dried out my hair, so I took off one lippie for that. But after that I've really grown to love this product. I'm trying to grow my hair out but it spilts so easily that I really wanted to try something that claims to mend spilt ends so that I could go longer between haircuts.

Now that I've been using this for a few weeks, I've noticed a real difference in my hair. It's softer, and it still looks like I just got my hair cut. I've noticed that there are fewer split ends in my hair now, which is great. I'm thinking about trying out the rest of the coconut milk line because this has worked great.

EDIT TO ADD:
Ok, after about two months I noticed my split ends were running rampant in my hair. I've also grown very tired of the really strong scent.

The only negative is that it has a very strong scent. It reminds me of sun tan oil. But if you don't cake your hair in this stuff, it's not that bad.

2014-08,1.0,"Pretty awful product. I was so disappointed when returning this shampoo because it smelled wonderful, claimed to provide volume without harsh stripping, and I've had good experiences with Organix products before. This product completely dehydrated my hair and didn't even add any volume. Volumizing shampoos tend to dry hair a little due to the alcohols in the ingredients that add volume, but I have never experienced a volume shampoo as drying as this one. Probably the reason I didn't see any volume was because my hair was so damaged and stripped of all moisture by this shampoo it couldn't be manageable. I even double-conditioned my hair (with my usual conditioner, not the one from this line), which I never have to do since my hair is pretty short, and it still was a wiry bundle of straw. For reference, I have naturally wavy, fine-textured, dry hair that is colored and heat styled.
I have read on some other reviews that this shampoo can be drying and instruct to use it every other time you wash, but I would recommend this shampoo for people with oily hair that does not get dried out or dehydrated easily because I only wash my hair 3-4 times per week due to its natural dryness, and this shampoo only exacerbated my hair's natural lack of moisture. I tend to find that I am either impressed with Organix products and repurchase them at least once, or I absolutely despise them and return them ASAP. I love the argan oil hair mist, the coconut oil spray, and the Brazilian keratin hair mist by Organix.

I have spent a fortune on every product out there that claims to help with such.  This is the *ONLY* shampoo I've found that improves the thickness (volume) and texture of my hair. I buy it by the case on Amazon for fear that the company will some day discontinue it or change the formula like so many companies do.  Organix, if you're reading, please, PLEASE don't ever do away with this product or change anything about it.  

I will say that I'm not a big fan of the conditioner, it leaves my hair too tangled and frizzy.  I use Pantene Volume Conditioner.  I use it sparingly and it detangles my hair and takes care of most of the frizz without weighing it down.  

Another thing that has drastically helped my pathetic aging hair is that I quit having my hair professionally colored.  Even the top salons were damaging my hair (probably due to the fact that I couldn't get it through their heads that thin, aging hair processes WAY faster than normal hair).  I now color my own hair with Sally's AGEbeautiful line (I know, some of you are cringing right now), and I only process it for half the time.  Even you young girls with thinning hair would benefit from using AGEbeautiful.",Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo

Buying the product it is a cute bottle and WONDERFUL smell!

Washing for the first time: I just washed my hair with it and my hair smells and looks wonderful, not tangling at all and seems soft and manageable! So far 5 stars! I hope it keeps my hair clean and non-oily for the next 24 hours!

24hrs After Washed: Still soft and manageable! No tangles throughout the day and my hair did not get super greasy by the end of the day like some shampoos do with my hair. Also I kept breaking out on my forehead from my last shampoo and so far no new acne with this shampoo! So still 5 stars! See you in 1 week!

It left my scalp super irritated and with a dry skin issue. I don't typically have a manageability problem with my hair, but this caused a dry and frizzy mess. I have a lot of long fine straight hair, not dry nor oily (I wash every 2-3 days), for what it's worth.  I don't find this shampoo even cleanses well.

2012-08,2.0,"No...just no. This shampoo is horrible for my hair. I bought it because I'm on a hunt for a good sulfate free shampoo. L'Oreal's EverPure shampoo caused a lot of hair fallout, so I tried this one. After I rinsed the shampoo out I couldn't believe what a poof of tangles my hair was. I hoped that the matching conditioner would detangle my hair. I had to apply it to my root area, which is a big no-no for fine hair like mine, but my hair was such a tangled mess I needed conditioner from root to tip. I wasn't happy about that, and thought about what a limp mop my hair would be. Even worse, when I rinsed the conditioner out after leaving it on for a few minutes, my hair was still tangly and felt like straw. So I applied my trusty Nioxin conditioner which completely detangled it, but I had to apply it to the roots again. For some reason, I still had hope for the shampoo, thinking if I gave my hair enough time to adjust to it, it would begin to work better. For two weeks I continued the process of shampooing, applying the conditioner root to tip after my hair continued to get extremely tangled from the shampoo, then using my nioxin conditioner after the organix one didn't help. After no improvements in two weeks I don't know/care if it'll ever work. I'll hold on to the conditioner cause it might work with a better shampoo. As far as my hair turned out afterward when I let it air dry, it actually wasn't bad. It looked really shiny and silky, but with all the conditioner I have to use it's just not worth it. After my bad experiences with sulfate free shampoos I might just go back to normal shampoo. Gave this product two lipped because it smells amazing, and since its sulfate free it would be a good alternative to normal shampoos if it works for someone else.

Use it with the conditioner to get better results because it really just makes my oily scalp clean and my hair lightweight. I also find my hair to air dry a whole lot faster with this shampoo/conditioner combo and tangles are a lot lesser too.

I wanted to try an organic shampoo and found this in the shampoo section at Walmart. At the time I was experiencing slight hair loss, and while the ends of my hair were slightly dry, I wanted something that wouldn't dry out my hair further. Unfortunately, this wasn't going to help.
Not only did my hair lack improvement, but I was left with an awful itching. I thought maybe the itching would disappear but it progressively got worse. I don't know if I'm allergic but it might be something you should look into if you purchase this shampoo.
Also, I was used to washing my hair every other day. This shampoo doesn't seem like it cleans well enough. So the next day I'd end up having to wash my hair again.
One thing I do love is the smell of this shampoo. It smells amazing and seems very potent, such that I could smell it in my hair even the day after. Bottle reminds me of L'oreal kids which is never a bad thing since I really liked that product as a kid.",Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo

First off, the smell is heavenly. Delicious. I got this with the conditioner and after air drying, my hair is fragrant, clean, and silky.

Note that this is my second sulphate-free shampoo. The first one I tried was the Burt's Bee's Raspberry Moisture Shampoo, or something like that. It wasn't AMAZING, since my hair only felt soft and manageable when I used the Burt's Bee's Deep Conditioning Treatment, so when I ran out of that, I thought I would get this brand (:

What drew me in was the packaging. How cute! And the smell is absolutely heavenly. It smells floral and fruity at the same time (the beauty of cherry blossom!) and it has kind of a vanilla scent to it too when you lather it in.

However, after using the shampoo, my hair didn't feel SOFT.
Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the shampoo and the conditioner together since they make my hair so shiny and healthy-looking when used together! The conditioner helps to soften my hair a bit, so don't get this shampoo without the conditioner.

The final verdict?
My hair hasn't felt healthier! It's slightly more rough than when I used the Burt's Bee's shampoo and deep conditioning treatment, but this is only after two or three uses. I'm overall satisfied with this product. It makes my hair healthy looking, it doesn't make it look damaged, it looks shiny and although it isn't exactly SOFT, it's really not rough either! :)

2010-08,4.0,"I've been using this shampoo for about a month now, and it's become one of my favorites.  It does have a lovely fragrance.  My hair can be difficult - naturally it's very fine and straight, so to get some volume and style-ability, I have it permed and I style it using round metal brushes and a blow dryer. Pretty drying routine.  Right now the perm's grown out on the top, so it's flat again and the back is dry and frizzy.  The Cherry Blossom Ginseng shampoo and conditioner have done wonders for both problems.  The conditioner is one of the few I've ever used that doesn't leave my hair weighed down and flat, and the shampoo really is volumizing.  I've been getting even better results by putting the conditioner on just the dry areas and rinsing it out before I shampoo.  The results are so good I won't need to schedule my next perm as soon as I thought I'd need to.",Rejuvenating Cherry Blossom Ginseng Shampoo

Initial use was all good, however after a month of regular use (every second or third day), this stuff has killed my hair.

I use about two to three sprays for my hair, avoiding my roots since that area gets oily already. It is slightly heavy so those with finer hair may want to use less or avoid it, but it controls flyaways and frizzy ends very well. I like that this contains castor oil as well. It does provide adequate shine and it leaves my hair feeling soft. Overall, it is pretty good for a spray leave in. ",Luxurious Moroccan Argan Creme Sheer Hydration Leave-in Mist
2014-08,5.0,"As the front of the product states, it is a &quot;leave-in spray lotion,&quot; and I would say it is similar to the consistency of It's A 10.  It makes my hair really soft and shiny!  Like any other leave-in product, I concentrate this on the middle and ends of my hair since my hair tends to get oily towards the end of the day.  It has a very pleasant smell reminiscent of a men's cologne (possibly JPG Le Male) in my opinion.  This lovely scent does not last throughout the day like It's A 10 tends to do, but that's fine to me.  I am glad I decided to try this because it is a way less expensive alternative to It's A 10 and I reap the same benefits from this product.  I purchased a 6 oz. bottle for about $6.  Also, I like that the product comes in a spray bottle as opposed to a pump.

I saw this in a magazine and the benefits said to hydrate hair and leave it moisturized. I thought it would be a light mist but it actually is more of a creme with an oily texture. When I applied it to my hair and combed it through, it instantly made it smooth and silky. It might take a bit of the creme to tame fly aways but I am very happy with this product.

2014-08,5.0,"Wow.  I am absolutely in love with this stuff.  I am especially pleased because I decided to pick this up in a hurry one day at CVS because I was afraid I was going to run out of conditioner before my box of Harvey Prince hair stuff arrived.  It was a BOGO sale and I decided to try this with the oil treatment (which I haven't opened yet), but I have finished the bottle of this and will definitely be repurchasing.  I tend to purchase very moisturizing conditioners because I have very long hair that I often heat style, but I also have very greasy hair with a lot of product buildup from all the leave-in stuff I add.  Therefore, the moisturizing conditioners I often lean toward sometimes backfire and end up adding a lot of weight and even more buildup to my hair.  (Nexxus, especially!) This conditioner added a nice, silky, yet lightweight feel to my hair on top of holding in the moisture and smelling great.  I wish the bottles/packaging was a little larger with Organix products in general, which is my only real complaint.  This product is up there on my HG list of conditioners (Fekkai PrX Reparatives, and BedHead Styleshots Extreme Straight), I am both humbled and very excited to have found a drug store conditioner that is not only inexpensive, but up to snuff with the fancy ones! ",Moroccan Argan Oil
2014-08,2.0,"To be frank and direct, this conditioner didn't meet my hair's standards. For me, I like my conditioners to moisturising and this did not do well. Even with an adequate amount of conditioner, it wasn't enough to soften my hair throughout two days. On the first day, my hair felt soft, manageable and silky. I was able to run my hair through it without any tangles. However, on my second day I don't know why, but immediately it starts feeling rough, tangled and a bit dry. Magically, on the second day, it just seems like my hair wants to stop having a soft, silky structure but rather transform into a tress that is simply 'unmanageable'.  (I have fine, straight hair) 

The conditioner is not moisturising; one quarter through the product, I found it didn't give enough softness to endure for two days. I will continue to finish this product but I add another conditioner for more silkiness and smoothness. It's simply not enough to 'continue' the softness and only after one day (with hair down or up), it was just not satisfying. The price for this product in Australia is pretty expensive, from $7.99 in US to around $17.95 in Australia (for just the one). For this, I wouldn't be repurchasing. 

My only positive point is that it does gives you the 'shine'! I always wash out the conditioner with cold water but I used warm-hot water (because the weather was freezing) one time and it still gave me the same result! Super shiny, everytime you move the shine moves with you. I guess the packaging appeals to people, it appealed to me! ",Moroccan Argan Oil

Quite possibly the worst conditioner I've purchased in awhile. 

Bottle design is awful - you need to squeeze hard to get any product out even with a full bottle, texture was ok; so-so, easy to spread but after I'd rinsed a few times it still felt as though there as a massive film coating my hair. 

I didn't apply this anywhere but on the ends of my hair and by the end of the same day my hair was greasy, heavy, and generally just really awful.

2014-08,3.0,"The reviews for this product seem all over the place! But as someone pointed out, everyone's unique hair chemistry will yield a different result...My hair is dry/ damaged &amp; thin from highlighting very light blonde. The super-hard water at our house doesn't help matters either (even with a water filter). I look for a conditioner that will serve either as a &quot;daily&quot; conditioning product (not too heavy, gives good slip) or as a &quot;weekly&quot; conditioning product (corrects damage). This really didn't fall into either boat. The formula is very thick and my hair seemed to drink it up. I noticed a slight oil-kind of fragrance, but nothing strong. I rinsed the product out after less than 5 minutes because I was concerned that it might actually be too heavy (I don't shampoo/condition daily, so I don't want to start out with greasy hair). The conditioner rinsed clean, but wow, did I have the tangles, even after using my usual detangler/heat protector spray. I think I actually lost more hairs than usual (very bad). My hair seemed more difficult to dry than normal, frequently tangling. Once done, it had a nice sheen, but did not look or feel anything special. I would not repurchase because I don't see this fitting in with either my regular routine or my deep conditioning routine. And I definitely cannot afford extra hair loss.

Given that Moroccan argan oil seems to be THE thing at the moment, I guess I was expecting a lot more from this than it actually delivered.

I have to say, this Organix conditioner is awful on my hair. Even using a very generous amount, when it goes on my hair it feels like it does nothing, when it washes out of my hair, it feels the same. It somehow seems to make my hair drier, and I can barely comb it once out the shower, I have to spray on a separate leave in conditioner!

Even I would have problems with this conditioner If I had to rinse it all out. I just don't think that this is a FULL rinse conditioner. Try this technique if your having problems. You have nothing to lose :)

This conditioner is better than any other sulfate free products I've tried (e.g. Boots Naked range) and just as good as any other moisturising ones.

Nothing smells as good as the John Frieda Brilliant Brunette conditioner...",Moroccan Argan Oil
2012-08,2.0,Let me just say the whole Organix line is probably the best smelling drugstore shampoos and conditioners you can buy. The performance however is a totally different story. I have tried the coconut shampoo and conditioner in the past and it was not a good experience. You'd think I would have learned my lesson then. I decided to give the Moroccan Argan Oil line a try anyway. Once  again just as the coconut conditioner did It didn't moisturize or detangle my hair at all! My hair felt stiff and sort of crunchy when I got out the shower. It took me forever and a day to comb the tangles out of my hair! It also stripped my hair pretty bad. I so wanted to like this stuff because it smells so good! But it's so horrible for my hair. Makes me kinda sad actually lol. Anyway I give it 2 lippies for the great scent.  ,Moroccan Argan Oil
2012-08,1.0,"This was horrible. Its so thick that its almost impossible to get out of the bottle. My hair is about half way down my back and I used a nickle sized drop just to put on my ends and it made my hair feel weighed down and greasy. It smells good, but that's about it.

I only wash twice a week using minimal shampoo - however --- conditioner must be top notch and control these curls! I had read that argan oil is a great conditioner for thick/curly hair, so I gave this a shot. I LOVE the smell, and if you get lucky you can find the 50% free bottle (huge, lasts a long time)... the texture of the conditioner is very thick, almost like a lotion? I use quite a bit twice a week, and leave it in for at least 5 minutes in the shower; rinse out with cold water, and braid the locks (no leave-in conditioners, they make my hair into the Amazon). It makes my hair SUPER shiny, the curls are VERY controlled - no tangling or knots, and the spirals fall beautifully. My hair feels very strong and healthy. The scent of the conditioner is also very pleasing! For the price, and the awesome ingredients - I am addicted to this stuff, it is all I need in a conditioner!",Moroccan Argan Oil

This is pretty average, it doesn't detangle your hair when your in the shower, I like when I can run my fingers through my hair with conditioner in it, that way I feel like its going to make my hair soft. This doesn't really do it. Its not bad either, it kinda makes my hair thicker for some reason. Its really average tho, theres no wow factor here and its just a marginal conditioner.

2012-08,5.0,"I love this conditioner! I use it in conjunction with the shampoo and the two have transformed my hair; this makes it so shiny and glossy. Before using these products I had to wash my hair every other day without fail, now I can go a maximum of four days if I have to. My hair used to take all day to dry (it's down to my waist) and with this, it dries in only four hours. I would like to point out that after squeezing the excess water out of your hair, *do not* try and brush/comb your hair. Give it about 45 minutes and a lot of the tangles will fall out by themselves, making it much easier to get a wide-toothed comb through your hair.

You do need to leave the conditioner in for three minutes to get the best result and *do not* apply it to your scalp. It will weigh your hair down and give a greasy appearance. I have also noticed that other users have stated that their hair feels really weird after using it - this is because you haven't washed it out properly (and yes, I am speaking from personal experience)! Give your hair a really good rinse and squeeze the hair out onto the palm of your hand - if the water looks even a little bit milky, keep rinsing. ",Moroccan Argan Oil

My hair is dark, but it's bleached blonde, so I use the Kerastase line of products as my staple.  Since it's painfully expensive, I'm always on the lookout for cheaper ones that perform fairly well, just to relieve my budget every now and then.  I had high hopes for this one, but it's definitely not up to par.  I can understand if this was touted for strengthening properties and chocked full of keratin or something - which would mean that it wasn't a necessarily hydrating conditioner - but this has none of that!

Now I usually comb out my hair with a wide tooth comb when my hair is coated in conditioner. This conditioner did not detangle at all! I had to use way too much to get it done and by that time I had combed out a fair amount of hair. It has that generic cheap conditioner fragrance. The ingredients aren't really natural at all nor even organic as they're name (organix) suggests! The argan oil is pretty fair down on the ingredient list, that should have been the first red flag. Did not leave my hair moisturized. To get an idea of how much product I had to use to even get it to work to comb through my hair I have used half a 386 ml bottle in a week! I will never, ever buy this again. And although this is my first time trying this organix brand I doubt I will ever buy anything else from them either.

I have used the original macadamia mask and that one is much better than the Organix for moisturizing abilities, but the Organix version is better suited for those with fine/medium hair textures and will provide more volume.

I have the macadamia oil shampoo so after I used the shampoo I decided to not use the conditioner since I was going to use the mask. So after applying it I left it in my hair for the 3-5 minutes but I decided to leave it in longer and wash it out last minute.

I showered, washed my hair with Redken all soft shampoo and then put a size-able glob of the organix mask onto my towel dried hair. I left the product in for over two hours, then rinsed and towel dried.
I am not certain if this mask does any better of a job than using a thick conditioner as a treatment for the same amount of time. My hair feels soft, but my hair feels the exact same after using my Redken conditioner. 
This product does smell incredible, and I think it would make a great conditioner. As a mask, I do think it could be more moisturizing.

However This turned out to be pleasant mistake. I actually prefer it over the argan oil hands down! I thought they would be the same aside from sent, I couldn't have been more wrong. The argan oil is thick and heavy like olive oil, it would leave my hands greasy after applying it to my hair and it was easy to use too much and end up with oily hair but it did help so I continued using it.. but with the macadamia oil, it is a little thinner in consistency and after I rub it into my hair, what's left on my hands seems to soak in.. not leaving me scrambling for the nearest thing to wipe my hand on. I can even use it on my ends when my hair is dry without risking it making my hair feel dirty or sticky. My only complaints are definitely with the bottle, it would work so much better with a pump for two reasons, 1 it's near impossible to get the same needed amount every time when you have to pour it and 2 it's hard to hold the bottle if you've already applied the oil to your hair once because it can easily become slippery from the slightest oil still left on your hands. I would hate to spill  such a good product due to a less than fantastic bottle design.

2015-08,3.0,"   This serum was waaaay better than the coconut milk serum! This one is thinner and smelled better and did a little more for my hair.

   I have dry hair, and I used this back before I knew anything about hair. This served as a de-frizzer for me. And it worked well for that, it made my hair shiny and soft, but it wasn't as beneficial in the long-run for my hair. That's what silicones (the big component in this product) do, they make your hair look good in the now, but as soon as you wash it out, it is in the same state as before. 

   After I learned more about hair, I only used this for heat styling. Then I was introduced to Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum, which worked better for me during the heat styling occasions. So I gave this product away. 

   Now I just use pure almond oil, argan oil, or coconut oil on the ends of my hair and they do the same thing this serum did BUT they are beneficial to my hair in the long run, as they improve moisture retention.

I use a dime-sized amount (probably a bit less), rub between my hands, then apply mostly to the ends. Whatever's left over gets lightly run through damp-ish hair and very gently patted on the top near my part to calm any flyaways. I then let it air-dry w/o no problems or greasy-look. If I remember or feel like making an effort, I run a brush through after it dries. Maybe. Sure, it'd probably help my hair look even more shiny and amazing if I used it before blow-drying, but I hate blow-drying. The best part of this stuff? It's a drugstore product so it's affordable AND it smells like Kissing Potion--you know, that lip gloss that came in a rollerball applicator. The only drawback? The packaging. Wish it came in a dropper bottle or squeeze bottle or something similarly easy to control. The top is just a hole w/ a flip cap, so sometimes you get more than you want and it spills and spreads out the top.

2012-08,4.0,"I have been using this dry oil on my hair all week, and I really like it so far. I'm a little skeptical because it is on the thick side for an oil. There is coconut and avocado oil in here in addition to macadamia, and so I just had to try it. I did notice my hair felt instantly soft. My hair is thick and damaged, so my hair soaks it up. It does coat my hair slightly, but I feel like it's in a good protecting kind of way. I haven't notice any dryness or breakage on my weak areas on the ends of my hair, so I like it for now. I think this serum would be amazing if I wore my hair curly natural. I straighten my hair everyday, and usually thinner serums work better for that, but this one I am really liking so far. I will update if things change.",Macadamia Dry Styling Oil
2012-08,3.0,"I'm torn on this one, that's why I give it a 3. I can't decide if I like it or not.

The first thing is it's a heavier oil than I expected.. In the grocery store, I've purchased Macadamia oil for cooking, and it's a much thinner oil. I know they have to add stuff to make it more suited to hair styling, but it was much heavier than I thought it would be.

Contrary to a heavy oil, I flat ironed my hair with this, and the ends were dry and more split end looking. I'm not blaming Organix for the state of my hair, as I'm guilty of heavy styling, but I'd expect a heavy oil like this to smooth my ends. Other Organix hair serums smoothed my ends wonderfully, and so does the Got 2 B smoothing serums.

Maybe this isn't meant for a person like myself. Maybe it works well for someone who isn't a heavy styler, and hasn't bleached their hair more than once. I might buy it again, but only to use on damp hair. I would, then, add another product for heat protection on top of the dry styling oil. Maybe I'll use it to smooth the ends after I've styled.",Macadamia Dry Styling Oil
2012-08,5.0,"I'm on my second bottle of this stuff and I absolutely love it.this is the first organix product I've used.it leaves my hair so soft and smells so great.the bottle is a pain sometimes though.the bottle gets oily sometimes.the top also isn't that great.i use about a quarter size of this and have to close the bottle really fast to make sure it doesn't spill.i have long hair close to my belly button and I have days where it will feel damaged than days where it will be healthy due to the thickness.i use this stuff everyday and I never have this problem anymore.this never gets greasy on me but I'm sure if you have thinner hair,you would have to use it sparingly.my first bottle lasted me almost two months with daily use and there's a good amount of product for the price.its about seven dollars at Walmart.

2012-08,4.0,"I bought this after really liking the Awapuhi dry styling oil. It turned out to be thicker than the other dry oil, which I wasn't expecting. It felt a little weird in my hands compared to other serums and oils, but it wasn't bad, just different. The smell is great, although I do prefer the other in that area. I applied this to damp hair after using the intensive mask from the same line. I found it a little sticky and gummy when I first put it in, and I took off 1 lippie for that. After my hair dried some, the feeling totally went away and WOW was my hair amazing. It was soft, hydrated, frizz-free, and straight! I have a little bit of a wave that I'd usually straighten, and this is the first product that really did all those things for me. I'm thoroughly impressed even though there was that sticky feeling. I'll be repurchasing!",Macadamia Dry Styling Oil

Usually I'm still pretty frizzy when I air dry even, especially since my Coppola Express is fading but my hair actually looks soft and shiny. Didn't weigh my hair down like Morroccan Oil. It's light like Alterna Kendi Oil but at less than half the price.

However, Organix's version of Macadamia Nut Oil is not nearly as good as the original. 
At first, I loved it. I blow dried and flat iron my hair after applying this product post-shampoo. My hair looked amazing...soft, bouncy, shiny and very healthy. By the next morning, my hair was a mess. It felt like gummy, fluffy hay. I couldn't re-straighten it without tons of fly-aways. Figuring maybe I used too much, I washed it out and used a tiny bit. Same result! Completely unmanageable the next day. The residue built up in my hair so badly that I looked like I had dandruff.

My long, thick, highlighted hair is thanking me now because it makes my hair so silky and shiny. I included a description of my hair because Im not sure how it will work on people with finer hair. But if your hair is completely damaged, this stuff is the answer to all your hair care problems. Plus, it smells amazing. :)",Macadamia Dry Styling Oil
2012-08,5.0,I got a sample of this with the Organix Macadamia Oil shampoo. I tried it out for a few days and fell in love. Organix products are BOGOF at Walgreens till the end of March so I definitely plan on going and picking up a few bottles of this because for the price you can't be beat. I do find it a tad bit on the pricer side for a drugstore product but it sure beats the price of the regular macadamia line.,Macadamia Dry Styling Oil
2012-08,4.0,"I got this product and Organix Awapuhi Ginger dry styling oil for $7.99 at walgreens (Buy1Get1FREE!) I had higher expectations for this product than the other one but this one let me down a bit. I really didn't get any spectacular results. I tried it one day and only put a small amount it made my hair soft for a while but did not get much shine. My hair was back to being VERY dry the next day. It also seemed to weigh my hair down a bit. The next time I tried it I used much less and got the same results. I still have plenty of product and plan to use the rest by putting a dollop or two in my conditioner for extra conditioning. Doing that hasn't given me any problems but using this on it's own was very underwhelming. Won't repurchase but it's worth a try if you like macadamia oil. Or perhaps find a sample somewhere. Some products are different depending on people and I can understand that. 

EDIT: Okay, I have changed my ratings. I tried this product one more time and got good results. I can only gather that the culprit for the bad results I got was my conditioner, not the oil.

I've used this product again twice after my review and got GREAT results- more toward the results I was looking for. It doesn't IMO work as great as other oils/serums I've used like argan oil but it left my hair shiny and managable. Would repurchase.",Macadamia Dry Styling Oil

I find that argan oil (even the 100% kind with nothing added) makes my hair amazing but then it always turns into a greasy mess. This is probably my doing, I usually put too much in and I'm always touching my hair. This stuff works so well with my bad hair manners, I never feel like I actually have anything in my hair.

I think macadamia oil is lighter than argan oil, and their last line of argan products was a little too heavy for my hair on some days.

2015-08,1.0,"This product was a major disappointment, and is what has put me off this brand for good.  While I haven't had any spectacular results with Organix products in the past, at the very least they more or less did what they were supposed to do, in a mediocre fashion.

This product not only did nothing to condition my hair, but I also experienced MORE tangles than usual after using it.  It gave my fine hair the texture of straw and made it knot like crazy - I eventually had to slap raw shea butter on my hair and wet comb it (carefully) to get the developing rat's nest of a knot out.  I have never had such issues with my hair, and I'm not particularly fussy about hair products; it has to be spectacularly bad to register.  I used up the bottle and have switched to another conditioner in the last week; ONE DAY and my hair already feels much better, silkier, fuller, and NOT TANGLED.

I liked the Macadamia intensive moisture masque (it came in the tub), but mostly for the smell, and I don't think I will ever buy another Organix product again.

I got this for half-price on clearance at CVS, almost $5.00 USD for 6.7 oz.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend this.

I will say that if you have had success with the other Organix conditioners and treatments, then you will really like this. It smell very nice (floral musk scent) and the scent does not linger long on the hair. I let it sit on my hair for around 3 to 5 minutes as suggested and then rinsed it off. It has very good slip and took a bit to rinse clean, yet my hair didn't feel like it had any residue. When my hair air-dried, it had good texture and shine. My hair was fairly easy to comb and did not look greasy. What impressed me the most is that it lived up to it's claims of being smoothing. It really helped to control frizz for me and left my hair soft. I think it has good moisturizing abilities for my hair though I would disagree with the super moisturizing claims on the packaging, but it does have a protein in it so those sensitive to that may want to avoid this one.

Also, there's glitter in it, even if they don't advertise it anywhere on the bottle so it's good to know, do not purchase this lotion if you hate glitter in your lotion. The packaging is super pretty tho.

I am a pretty big fan of Organix products and I freaking love their coconut scents so when I saw this on sale at Shoppers Drug Mart I decided to pick this up. Unfortunately I am not crazy impressed with this lotion. It is very smooth and light and rubs into your skin quite nicely but the moisturization isn't that great. My skin certainly doesn't feel dry after using this but it doesn't feel quite moisturized enough. I absolutely adore the scent though.

2014-08,5.0,"This is my Holy Grail product. Girls with thick, curly unruly hair who flat iron... read on!

I have VERY thick curly/wavy hair that requires flat ironing with my Babyliss Nano at 450 degrees to tame. I color every 4 weeks.  It is shoulder length and it takes me 45 minutes to section and straighten. I touch it up daily with the flat iron as it needs taming constantly. I even wear a shower cap and wash only once a week as the more product in my hair, the easier to control.

My biggest challenge is after a wash- so time consuming. Plus before this stuff it took a few days of adding product to reduce puffiness.  I use Purelogy Hydrate shampoo and Terax conditioner and add Purelogy hair oil (now discontinued)  after flat ironing to help tame. 
My hair sucks up a lot of product so I have to go lower end to flat iron
Most recently I have used the Organix Awapuhi Ginger dry styling oil to flat iron. Not bad but a touch greasy.

I am always on the lookout for products that will help me flat iron and tame my hair so when I saw this in Walmart for $6.76 I thought why not. 

I have used this three times to do complete flat ironing and styling OMG it is the BEST product I have ever found. 

It makes my hair SO SOFT and detangles as I flat iron. It flattens my super thick hair down to a point that looks &quot;normal&quot;! It's an easy spray on product. Big hair girls will understand this- other products left my hair still puffy and with too much volume even after the flat iron. 

It handles the heat of my flat iron and as a styling product adds a beautiful shine and softens beyond what I thought ever possible. Plus it smells nice- kind of vanilla coconut.  I can even run a comb through my hair when I'm done. I will buy this forever and I just bought another seven of them! Its affordable ( if you hunt online you can get reduced prices- I paid $5.75 a bottle at an Ulta sale). The bottle tends to slip a little while using due to the design but that means nothing to me given my results.

I ruled out a similar oil (Organix Kukui Oil) in the store- no softening at all. I just bought the Organix Relaxing Balm (pump lotion) that I applied to my dry ends after flat ironing and it worked well. Not sure if I need it but it's ok.

2014-08,2.0,"I'm not 100% sure whether I should be writing this review for the B5 shampoo or conditioner, as I'm not exactly sure which is responsible for wrecking my hair. I'm going to blame the conditioner, because in theory, even if a shampoo causes you some problems, a good conditioner should be able to go a long way in working out at least some of those problems. I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner as I saw they were new and I'm a sucker for trying new haircare products. I have medium blonde hair that is dry and still a bit damaged from a salon haircolor disaster almost a year ago; I have spent this past year buying and trying just about every moisturizing and/or repairing haircare product that I can to restore my hair to the health and beauty it had before that hair salon owner tortured it. It had really been starting to turn a corner in health, and then I tried this. The first time I used it, my hair was really dirty and the shampoo certainly got it clean; the conditioner feels very thick in hand and rinsed really clean, but I noticed I did need a fair amount of detangler spray. My hair also kind of had that &quot;dry&quot; feeling to it after it air-dried. The second time I tried both products it yielded about the same results, but the third was a disaster. This time, I used them on hair that wasn't as dirty (washed less than 24 hours before). I shampooed as usual and applied the conditioner; initially, the conditioner felt good, like I could actually feel my hair slipping around on my back. The INSTANT I got out of the shower, I had an &quot;uh-oh&quot; experience because I could literally feel my hair hardening and drying up. I didn't really even towel my hair off and went straight to the mirror to add detangler spray. Even with a BOATLOAD of detangler, I could hardly get my hair untangled. I was snarly, matted, dry, and tangly. I lost a lot more hair than usual, and I was so disappointed because this problem had so improved over the past few months prior to this incident. My hair LITERALLY FOR DAYS looked ratty and damaged. It's actually still getting over this stuff. I don't honestly know what the problem was, the shampoo lathers nicely, has a very pleasant light smell, does a good job cleaning -apparently, too good, and the conditioner seems like it is conditioning and adding slip, also smells nice (very light fragrance). But holy cow, when you get to styling, be warned, don't wait too long, or you may never get a comb through your hair again. And no, I did not change my washing technique or anything else. My hair is air dried basically every day and then worn up in a clip, also every day. Very little changes in my hair routine as far as that goes.

This is     the     first    conditioner I've    used    that    I   really noticed my    hair   be much    softer     and    shinier from.

In the shower it isn't super slippery but it spreads well and   actually makes my hair     feel thickand full    in   a    way that     I    haven't experienced   with    other products. My shampoo makes     my     hair feel    very non-slick and flat and conditioner usually just makes it feel slick   again but      this is like' wow I have a handfull of hair now'!.
The smell    is pleasant in the bottle but a bit strong out of the bottle and lingers for a while out of the     shower. The Tea Tree is just the tiniest bit bitter or     something so I don't *love* it.
But the main   thing is that since I started using this I notice my hair feeling so soft,    looking less stringy, and being  all around shinier so  that right there makes me want to buy it again  or maybe try a different     scent from this brand that has similar ingredients.

Just the shampoo might dry your hair out. When I followed up with this, I used it on the bottom half and waited 5 minutes before washing it out, but when I felt my hair, the top was a little dry compared to the rest, so I put a little on the top and waited about 10-15 seconds before washing it out and it felt the same.

Like it claims, I had no problems with it affecting my bleach blonde. In fact, my hair feels soft, looks beautiful, and smells great! Let me tell you, when lathering (and it does lather well) the smell is very strong, but after washing it out it's noticeable but much more subtle.

I'm not sure if I'll purchase this particular one, as the peppermint-y smell, while good, isn't my favorite, Next time I'm at the store, I smell test to see if others are better.

 I bought the Tea Tree in the hopes that it would also help get rid of dandruff but I haven't noticed a significant change. Either way, it is a decent product; I like the Organix line. The smell is amazing, and not too over-bearing. The mint scent also helps to wake me up in the morning.

I have long, color-treated, semi-oily hair. My current routine for using the Organix shampoo and conditioner, is to wash my hair with the shampoo, leave on for approximately 3 minutes. Rinse. Apply conditioner, leave on for approximately 5 minutes, rinse, apply conditioner again, leave on for another 3 then rinse. Even with though I use the conditioner twice, it leaves my hair so ridiculously dry and damaged looking. I will never buy this product again, or anything from the Organix brand. I am extremely dissatisfied.",Tea Tree Mint Conditioner

2010-08,2.0,"I bought this because it smells so awesome.  I'm looking for more natural products, so I was excited to try it.  Upon first usage, I noticed that it doesn't feel like a conditioner I'm used to.. it's not thick and creamy when applied to the hair, it almost seems like it's not even there.  I have to use alot of product to cover my thin, medium length hair.  Almost a palmful, while with other conditioners like Dove, TreSemme, etc. I only use a quarter sized squeeze.  This is because it doesn't contain silcone/chemicals that coat your strands.  My hair felt great fresh out of the shower and that sweet mint smell lingered for awhile... however, the next day my hair felt so stringy, tangled and unmanagable.  Weird because my hair is always soft, shiny, and healthy.  I won't buy this conditioner again.  For now, I've been mixing it with Pantene for scent purposes and to use it up.  What's the point of this stuff anyways?  I'm jealous of everyone this has worked for.. the scent is so lovely. :]",Tea Tree Mint Conditioner

2010-08,1.0,"I'm really surprised that so many people like this conditioner. I have long, straight hair, with a bit of dryness but no frizz. I purchased this because I've been trying to use more natural products and I love anything with tea tree oil.

I really wanted to like this brand, but unfortunately, this product didn't deliver for me. While it did an okay job of detangling my hair when in the shower, I was left with constant tangles for the rest of the day. I can't believe that didn't bother anyone else! I couldn't even run my fingers through my hair. Also, I noticed that my hair was full of static, and it's August! I can't imagine what would happen if I used this in the winter. My hair was really limp and even the color looked more dull. Lastly, the tea tree oil smell was weakened by an uber-sweet vanilla note that sort of ruined the usual greener smell of the tea tree. If the conditioner worked, then I would be able to handle the smell, but it was definitely not worth it for me.

I'm a stickler for using a product until it's gone, but I think I might have to ditch this one. Honestly, you'd be better off buying a 99 cent bottle of Suave.",Tea Tree Mint Conditioner

Even with other shampoos it does a great job of detangling.  It also smells really good, almost like Thin Mints!  The downside is that the bottle is a little small for the price, and I go through conditioner really quickly.

I don't have very dry skin so maybe some people need to use more than just this but I'll use lotion on top if I have time to kill but not necessary. I personally love the smell and I also sniffed it BEFORE I bought it so I wouldn't end up like people on here complaining about the smell of things.

2014-08,3.0,"This dry oil does feel luxerious initially and it has a pleasant scent and does dry into the skin very nicely. However, after some time I do not notice any obvious benefit to my skin. I don't have overly dry skin but I don't feel that the moisturizing effect of this product is very hydrating. It is nice and silky and makes my skin feel smooth immediately putting it on but I am not sure that it is helping the quality of my skin in the long haul. 

As others have pointed out, the bottle is very flimsy and it's hard to pour out a gradual amount and this seems like a really poor packaging design.

2013-08,2.0,"This is the first Organix product I've ever bought. I've seen the line before and read reviews on their other products but nothing really jumped out to me as a &quot;must try&quot;. While grocery shopping a few weeks ago, I spotted the Hydrating Moroccan Argan Dry Body Oil (which is evidently a new product) on the shelf and picked it up because I'm super lazy and hate putting lotion. For the past year or so, I've been using Neutrogena's Sesame Oil which I really love, but unfortunately I've only been able to find the regular scented version which I really, really don't like.

First, the good points. This oil is fairly moisturizing and has a decent smell. I'm not scent sensitive but I could see how someone who is might find the smell slightly overpowering. I wouldn't say the smell is yummy or anything one would want to douse themselves in. To me, this smells a little plastic-y (weird, I know) and slightly tropical in a fake they-totally-added-scent-to-this way. The scent is infinitely better than the old lady floral scent the Neutrogena folks use for their oil however. As for moisturizing, this does a fair job. Per the directions, this can be rinsed off after you apply it in the shower or you can smooth it on after your shower (while still damp) and pat dry for &quot;extra moisturizing&quot;. I use the latter method and it does keep my dry skin somewhat in check. I still have to apply lotion to my elbows (dry city), hands and feet so it's not a catch all. Since this is a dry oil, you're not going to look like an oil slick even if you apply too much. It sinks it rather quickly so if you're looking for something that you can apply and not be forced to wait for it to soak in, this is your oil. I believe I paid around $7 for a 6.8 ounce bottle which is about as much as a good drugstore lotion so the price is alright. I also haven't had an adverse reaction to anything in this. No weird bouts of body acne or anything like that but since the skin on my body is basically bulletproof, I'm not the best gauge for sensitivity.

Now, the bad points. This isn't as moisturizing as Neutrogena's Sesame Oil or even plain old baby oil by a long shot. With Neutrogena, my skin is still soft the next day. With Organix, not so much. I think the main reason for that is this &quot;Moroccan Argan Oil&quot; is mainly compromised of good old fashioned mineral oil. My biggest problem with this oil, however, is the bottle. When I first picked this up in the store, the top popped off without me squeezing it. The top itself is one of those weird designs that is slightly slanted and just pops off instead of screwing on. To me, this is the worst design for a bottle of liquid let alone an oil that you're suppose to use in a wet environment. I figured I picked up a bum bottle so I chose one that was at the back of the shelf. After I got it home, I noticed that it was leaking in the bag. As soon as I took it out of the bag, the top popped off again. I managed to keep the top on for a while and used it with relatively few problems (the top popped off twice when I used it but I caught it both times) but earlier this evening, I accidentally knocked the bottle over and about half the oil poured down the drain. Perhaps the store I went to got a defective batch but if goofy, pop off tops are the norm, I'll use something else.

I'm still undecided if I'll repurchase this because I'm a bit irritated by the bottle design and losing half the product down the drain. It's a decent enough product that is moderately priced but I don't know anyone who doesn't mind spending $7 for something in a shoddy bottle. I think I'll use up what's left of the bottle and go back to Neutrogena even though its a little more expensive.

Edit to add: I finally found a bottle of the Neutrogena unscented oil that I love so much. I stopped using this Organix nonsense because it wasn't as moisturizing and I found I still had to apply lotion to my hands, knees, feet and elbows.",Hydrating Moroccan Argan Dry Body Oil
2014-08,5.0,This has great smoothing properties without being greasy and it has a nice coconut and cocoa butter scent. My hair adores keratin based products and this is a good addition to my hair serum collection. It softens and gives my hair gloss and is wonderful for heat styling. It is moderately heavy so I like to reserve it for days when I don't wear my hair curly. Helps a lot with manageability. I can say that the anti-breakage claims are accurate as I have experienced less hair fall out in the shower. I wish this came with a pump but I can tolerate it.  ,Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2014-08,5.0,"My absolute favorite hair serum. 

Previously, before switching to all Organix products, my thick black hair was a frizzy, coarse, unhealthy mess. 

I started smoothing this serum into my hair from mid-shaft to the ends after showering. I've been using this consistently for about two years now and the result is amazingly shiny, healthy, smooth hair. Although it doesn't make my hair perfectly &quot;straight,&quot; I quite love how this makes my natural waves look. I get so many compliments on my hair, which used to be unheard of, considering what a mess it used to be. Running my fingers through my hair is an enjoyable experience now and this product really has boosted my confidence.

My only complaint is that I wish this came in a pump container, but this is very minor considering how amazing this serum really is.

I only use a smaller-than-a-dime sized amount and this is enough for my long, thick hair. 

I can't seem to find it in stores anymore but this is very inexpensive on Amazon (around $6) and quite worth it. ",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2014-08,4.0,"This is amazing stuff. I was previously using the Moroccan Argan Oil Penetrating oil, but it seemed to be a bit... heavy. Then I tried this Brazilian Keratin Therapy anti breakage serum, and wow, what a difference.

It is much lighter in weight than the Penetrating Oil. I thought that a heavier weight serum would be better, but it turns out that the lighter weight anti breakage serum is even better for my medium-coarse sometimes dry hair.

It does have a slightly coconut or tropical scent, but I only notice it when I first put it on my hair. I use it after I've wrapped my hair up in a towel to dry a bit, and then apply this product right before I blow dry. I smooth it down on my ends and the longer parts of my hair, and then when I flip my hair up, I use what's left on my palms to smooth down the fly aways at the crown of my head. I've been really happy with it.

The only drawkback so far is that this comes in an opaque container, so I can't see exactly how much product is left. I can kind of use the weight of the container to estimate how much I have left, but I'd really prefer a clear container so as to better guess when I need to repurchase.

I got this and the hydrating macadamia oil intensive moisture mask as part of a BOGO free at Walgreens last week. I only wash my hair up to 2x a week, so I don't get a lot of chances to review hair products. This just had such an impact I had to share right away. I have a ton of products for my hair, most are the repairing type, not for styling. I have naturally wavy hair, made more wavy with the new-ish L'oreal sea salt spray in the purple bottle. But with winter coming, I knew I wasn't being good to my hair, so when I saw I'd only have to pay $7 for 2 Organix products, I picked those products in the end. They only had 3 or 4 of the &quot;lines&quot; from Organix though so be aware of that. Anyways, I used a Dove shampoo, the macadamia mask as a conditioner, my usual after-shower products, and this serum. I showered at night, let my hair air dry as I always do, didn't really do anything but parted my hair. I went out. When I got back home I noticed my bangs looked as if they were straightened! It was really interesting! Today I see my hair is almost completely frizzless (I've been touching my hair a lot so that's prolly why there's any at all), it's not poofy at the bottom like it usually is, and for the most part the upper half of my hair is straight then the bottom half has loose S-shaped waves with wispy ends.

2011-08,5.0,"I was so excited to try this product, as I have heard a lot about keratin.  I was disappointed with the packaging.  It is a very runny watery product and the way they made the bottle isn't very practical.  Aside from the annoying bottle, this product works wonders.  I have been using a chi straightener for about a year with no heat protection.  Needless to say, my hair has a lot of breakage.  This product smoothed down my hair and made it straight and shiny.  My hair color (which I am not thrilled with) looked SO MUCH BETTER! My hair pulled more red than brown this time it was dyed and the hard water in my area makes it look more orangey.  I'm waiting to get it dyed an ash brown until I go home for thanksgiving break, but this product helps it look more polished in the meantime.  I will continue to use this no matter what my future hair color is because it looks so good.  The one downside is that I can tell this will leave build-up quickly.  I will have to use a clarifying shampoo once or twice a week to get my hair refreshed.  Overall, this is a great and cheap product!  Oh, and it smells awesome too!",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,2.0,"I loved the name of the product, sounds so exotic as its beautiful smell. However, the product was too much like liquid for its packaging quality, and so there was some excessive wastage. 

Firstly, I have waste length hair that everyone comments on how beautiful and smooth it is because i am obsessed with its condition to the point i ALWAYS wear a hat to protect it from the sun.

The product is good at protecting the hair shaft, making it smooth and detangle. However, the oil in the product is hard to remove so I had to shampoo it quite a bit (READ: damaging) to remove it, making my hair dry as you should not scrub the long lengths with a shampoo.

The worst - in summer it make my hair so itchy and I started breaking out in dermatitis and flies LOVE that coconut smell in summer, as the heat starts making smell like vomit after a while. So sad:(",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,2.0,"i was really hoping to be in love with this stuff. Oils work very well on my hair, but this one did not. It actually made my hair frizzier than anything. It did speed up drying time. It made my hair kind of dull at first, but then after i straightened my hair i put a little bit more on, and it made it a little more shinier, but not much. My hair honestly looks way better without it. I always get compliments on my hair, and i couldn't wait to wash this stuff out of my hair. and i honestly didn't notice any difference in helping with the breakage. It does smell amazing though, thats pretty much the only thing i liked about this product. It is pretty expensive for such a little bottle, but a little goes a long way with this and it will last you for a while no matter what type of hair you have. The way it's packaged can get kind of messy after a while, but i still think the bottle is cute. it's honestly nothing special, not worth the money. I would not repurchase. there are so many better products than this. Not a fan of Organix products.",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,5.0,"Yes. I will buy this again. And again. And again.
I'm writing a review for this serum In particular as opposed to the handful of others I've tried recently as it's been making noticeable improvements in my hair. I have other serums that I love, but this one is pretty special.
First off, I don't trust Organix hair products much due to their consistently awful reviews, and because I tried their morroccan oil and it sucked. I got this serum knowing it's Organix and taking the risk, since the ingredients list is quite unique, and I wanted a protein-infused alternative to my regular serums. Not only does it have keratin, but there's other goodies in there like avocado oil and coconut oil.
The packaging is, like most other reviewers have stated, annoying. Yes, it's a cute shape and has a pretty brown and gold color scheme, but the bottle's opening just makes dispensing the product a messy ordeal. I like serums with pumps. It's just more logical and efficient.
Of course, it's what's on the inside that counts, though. This serum is non-sticky, relatively light, goes on smooth, and smells AMAZING. I use a couple of nickel-sized drops on my wet hair after detangling (note: this amount might be too much for some, as I have very thick hair), run it through, and let air dry.
As my hair air dries, it's SO much shinier, healthier, softer and plumper than when I use other serums. The fragrance doesn't really linger, unfortunately, but that's not a problem. Frizz is basically obliterated, but my volume isn't taken away in the process. My curls look defined and shiny and maintain flow.
I truly wish I could use this serum every time I wash my hair, but I wouldn't want my locks to get used to it, and protein overloads are never a good thing. This brilliant serum is DEFINITELY staying on my dresser, and I'll continue to repurchase. (Doesn't hurt that it's not too pricey, either! :D)",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,5.0,"It smells amazing. Like other reviews, the packaging is a bit of a problem but its worth it cuz the product inside is fantastic. It makes my hair,straight,soft, and shiny.

2011-08,5.0,"This product is awesome! I color my hair alot &amp; my hair has been breaking off. I found this at Harmon's Beauty store and decided to try it. It has helped my hair so much, I've noticed a difference the first time using it. My hair is so soft and doesnt break off in the shower as much before. It makes the elasticity of your hair much stronger! You don't have to use a lot. Just a dab in the palm of your hands and work through from roots concentrating on the ends. after that I add a heat protector to hair and blow out. It adds shine softness and makes your hair durable when styling. I love this !!!! I wasn't expecting much because of the price. it really surprised me! Def buy this product!",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,5.0,"This is the BEST thing that ever happened to my hair. First of all, I have a tumultuous relationship with my hair. We've been through a lot, and lately I've been on the hunt to find a great product that will give my thick, wavy and naturally dry hair a serious makeover. Organix products have always piqued my interest for some reason, probably because of their beautiful scents and the yummy sounding names. I saw this Brazilian Keratin Serum on the shelf at CVS and gave it a whiff. So. good. It's a very warm and intoxicating scent, kind of like fresh coffee and cocoa beans, but that's probably because of the cocoa butter in the ingredients. There's also coconut oil, keratin, avocado oil and alot of cones in the list. 


This serum is different than others I've tried. It doesn't make my hair feel greasy or coated in oils, it's actually pretty light. I worked a good amount into my damp towel dried hair and then after it dried, I rubbed a small amount all over my head, concentrating on the ends. My hair is now sleek, plush, healthy, lustrous and frizz-free. It's summer. It's hot. It's humid. That's a recipe for disaster for my hair. I get very frizzy waves, but this even made it STRAIGHT. It also aids in protecting the hair from breakage which is excellent since I'm trying to grow my hair really long. This has definitely become an HG product for me. I will repurchase and repurchase and repurchase!


*The only negative thing I have to say is that too much of the product can squirt out of the tube sometimes, and something with a pump or different packaging would be less messy. Other than that, total perfection! Loving my hair right now!",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,4.0,"I have long, straight hair that has a tiny bit of a natural wave. I used this product for the 1st time this morning, and I used a silver dollar sized amount I towel-dried hair which I definitely thought was too much. After blowdrying and straightening, it felt oily, but soft. It also was completely stick straight. About an hour into my day I noticed it felt a lot less oily and very soft. About 3 hours into my day there was a sudden downpour in FL summer heat and I got pretty wet. Normally my hair + rain + humidty = awful frizzy huge hair. But after my hair naturally dried while I was outside, I brushed it and realized it was super soft and without an ounce of frizz. I am COMPLETELY amazed.",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,5.0,"WOW! I used to use the John Frieda Lite serum, but its been discontinued.  I used up the last of my stash and was forced to find a replacement.  I was worried, as I have baby fine hair and most serums just weigh my hair down.  I read the reviews on this product and checked it out.  I'm in love.  This is as light as the John Frieda, but smells 100x better!  Not greasy (unless you pile it on), controls frizzies in humid, Florida summer weather and gives a mirror-like shine.  Easy to wash out, too, doesn't weigh your hair down.  What else I love?  That my hair feels like silk when I run my hand through it.  I have some seriously sexy hair now!  My only complaint is the packaging.  A pump would be less messy!",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,1.0,"I am sadly disappointed with my high hopes for this product. I have been wanting to try a Moroccan oil for some time and was deciding between this and the blue Argan bottle of this by Organix. I chose this based on the reviews below. 

I found the formula to be sticky and heavier than what I used to use (BioSilk) and that it did not improve the condition of my hair or allow for easier styling or improved slip. I bought it the day after I cut my hair from bra-length to above shoulder length, too, so I imagined this would make my hair really great/perfect after removing six inches of length. It is about as heavy as the John Frieda serum you have to apply to wet hair (maybe that is what I should try next) rather than damp.  My hair just felt sticky and gross after I applied the pea-size amount, and I had to wash my hands before blowing dry.

I have had a lot better luck with BioSilk (which I can apply on my skin after I use it) --not sticky at all even though it is a cone--and I have had good luck with Garnier's clear Anti-Frizz sleek and shine serum. I didn't care much for John Frieda's just due to heaviness and how it felt on my hair, and that is how I feel about the Organix one too. Sad!",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,4.0,"I love love love this stuff.  I feel like i'm ALWAYS on the hunt for something to help me get control of my hair that seems to be misbehaving all the time.  Just when I thought I was out of luck, enter Organix.  I applied the product to towel-dried hair that was still a little damp.  I just let my hair airdry for the rest of the day.  When I would take my hair out of the bun it was in all day, instead of a curly frizzy mess, it was still wavy, but smoother.  It has cut down my styling time literally in HALF.  It doesn't get rid of the natural curl I have, but makes it soo much easier to style.  

It's cheap, smells AH-mazing!! (like coconut cotton candy!)  The packaging is a little awkward, but is a great size if you travel a lot.  All in all, it's fantastic for all you curly/wavy haired babes out there!!!  :)",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum

I'm not thrilled with the package and find that I either get too much or too little.  Overall, this is well worth the money and a great drugstore find.  I will never go back to Moroccan oil again.",Brazilian Keratin Therapy Anti-Breakage Serum
2011-08,5.0,"I wanted to use this for a good bit of time before I wrote this review.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!   I use it on wet hair before styling, and almost daily on dry hair just to give some polish and shine. I pour about a nickel size in my palms, rub together and just go over my whole head, if that makes any sense.  The smell is nice but not loud or overpowering.  It does not make my hair look greasy.  It soaks right in and just gives a perfect effect. It makes my (very dry) hair look healthy and shiny and easier to style.  I like this 100 times better than Morrocan Oil.  I will definitely buy again.  The bottle is lasting a long time, though, because it does not take much to do the trick.

But this stuff, wow, it did not disappoint at all. My hair really doesn't have breakage problems, nor have I ever really seen a split end. It's just dry &amp; since this product has great ingredients,  i just thought i'd give it a try. Avocado oil is reallllly great for my kind of hair [fine, wavy]. It actually did smooth my hair a bit as well, &amp; though it air dries frizzy &amp; poofy if I don't at least scrunch, it tamed it somewhat. It was better than what I had hoped for. It actually preforms better than my Macadamia Nut Oil that I purchased, which has that &amp; argan oil in it. My hair apparently likes this better :)

Though, it's kind of hard to get the product out without making somewhat of a mess. I tipped it slightly to get some out &amp; it runs down the side from the opening. Messy, but I'll deal with it. Not a huge issue. The little package is cute though. I like it.

This is a silicone &amp; oil serum that is to be applied to wet hair, pre-blowdry.  I am not thrilled with the amount of silicones in this, but I have been pretty anti-silicone the last few years as I was trying and trying to deal with my wavy/curly/poofy hair with the Curly Girl method (no cones, no sulfates.

Did I happen to mention the smell?  Yeah.  That good.  I have never tried Moroccan Oil but I am willing to bet this is similar and at a fraction of the cost.

I liked the lightweight nature of this product and I have the ability to use it as a smoothing creme after my hair is dried and straightened. It really helps my hair from being frizzy and gives a little shine as well. my only grip is the packaging. It's pretty difficult to use up the entire product because of the bottle. Also I can't turn it upside down unless I corner it between three products and even still I don't find that it all migrates to the top for me to use.

2012-08,4.0,This product is amazing it makes my hair so soft and smooth after I blow dry it. It is not too heavy an doesn't make my hair feel greasy and weighed down like some other products do. It also smells really good but isn't that strong.

If I do buy a different kind of shampoo, I'm never as happy with it as I am with my Organix Pomegranate Green Tea.  I have long, thick, somewhat wavy hair that tends to get frizzy and sometimes difficult to manage.  If I'm going to use a shampoo regularly, I want it to clean my hair without stripping it or drying it out, and I want the clean feeling to last all day so that my hair doesn't end up stringy and greasy by the end of the day or even the next morning.  This shampoo does that perfectly!  I also use a conditioner every day, and I feel like this shampoo gets my hair ready to let the conditioner do its job.

How the shampoo works is most important to me, but there are other perks here.  I actually like the packaging a lot.  The bottle fits in my hand very nicely, it's easy to squeeze, and I always feel like I get just about every last drop out of the bottle with no problem, so there's no wasted product.  The scent of the shampoo is lovely, sweet and fruity.  The consistency isn't runny buy isn't super thick either, and it lathers extremely well, so it's easy to spread through even my long thick hair.  It's also sulfate and paraben free, has &quot;organic active ingredients,&quot; and is supposedly not tested on animals.  From their website:  &quot;Organix® bottles are eco-friendly, manufactured from materials containing recycled post-consumer resin. All labels are printed utilizing environmental inks and compostable label film made from annually renewable resource corn, not from petrochemicals.&quot;  None of that sounds bad.

2010-08,4.0,"Okay first I have chin length bob brown with blonde highlights and VERY thick hair. I noticed the combination of having to wash every day and swimming was drying my hair out.

The smell is awesome but very powerful. I noticed it sticks around after you blow dry. For some this isn't a problem but I have a highly sensitive nose for some reason so it bothers me to wear hair spray plus perfume on top of my hair radiating pmegranite so I have to nix those other products when I use this shampoo.

Also, my hair was very tangled, every after using with the conditioner too. I am going to have to buy a hair de tangler spray-when I combed my hair while wet I could feel it breaking for the tangles-and my hair dresser told me I have very strong hair so this isn't good at all.

Other than that the shampoo cleans well, doesn't weight my hair down, and lathers perfectly. I have never tried this 'sulfate free'.

1)It was sulphate-free
2)The smell

I will definitely not be repurchasing this shampoo. It did nothing for my hair. Like right after I wash it makes my hair feel too clean and then like a few hours later (less than 12 hrs) it feels all greasy. It's kinda gross. I used the coordinating conditioner and that didn't do anything either. This is one of the worst shampoos I have ever used.",pomegranate green tea shampoo
2009-08,2.0," I didn't pick it up for its sulfate-free or organic properties, but the smell when I flipped open the cap lid.  I was sold.  It's divine.


 No, it didn't weigh down my hair, but there are some hairs I WANT weighed down - like the flyaways and baby hairs around the top of my head.  I also like lather.  This had very, very little, and I had to use quite a bit for my long hair.  When I stepped out of the shower, I didn't get that &quot;squeaky clean&quot; feeling that I happen to like in my shampoos.  Maybe that's the trade-off you get for an environmentally conscious product; who knows?  But it's not a trade-off I'm willing to make.


I grabbed this shampoo when it first came out and had a 100% mail-in rebate wrapped around the cap.  Glad I took advantage of that, because I'd never re-purchase this.  Shame.  The lingering scent is so nice.",pomegranate green tea shampoo

I have not tried this shampoo with a different conditioner, so I really can't say how it is on it's own - but I do not recommend the shampoo plus Organix Pomegrantate Conditioner.

It no longer retains to a whole bunch of water after every wash nor does it take as long to dry. I believe that this shampoo is responsible for a good cleaning as well as the softness and the shine, while the conditioner should be credited with not weighing down my hair with a bunch of silicones and additives.

So that is why I decided to go with sulfate-free shampoos. No more acne! I am really happy with this shampoo. I will try the other organix shampoos. They all seem to smell really good!

I basically use this product after I air dry my hair to tame my frizz and it works wonders. It tames my frizz and leaves my hair silky smooth and shiny. I use a tiny amount and rub it into my hands before applying it on my hair. I prefer using this on dry hair because if I use it when my hair is still wet it doesn't tame my frizz at all. Also you get a lot of product for the price because I've been using mine for almost 2 years and still haven't run out of it. So I'm genuinely happy with this serum!",Shea Butter Liquid Glass Serum
2013-08,5.0,"Wow, not sure whats with the negative reviews on this, but this is a HG product for my hair.  Maybe its the hair texture?  I love this stuff.  It makes my dry, coarse, thick, long, curly/wavy, and hard to manage hair look very soft and shiny.

This is BEST applied when your hair is wet.  If you apply it dry it doesn't seem to do much.  I apply it when it's wet and let it soak in for about 30 minutes since my hair is so picky and then dry it.  It comes out very smooth and sleek.  If I straighten it after it is very very shiny and soft.  Anytime I use this and straighten it after my hair looks like a shampoo commercial, lol.

Not to knock anyone, but I did notice these types of products are more suited for people with my hair type and you have to let it soak in.  LESS is more as well.  I have been using these types of products for over 15 years and this is one of the best I have used FYI.  If you have thin hair, oily hair, or normal hair, I seriously would not recommend this stuff, or anything in this type of product field.

It smells great, though! 

This works really great on my Jamaican friend when he grows his hair out a bit. It really brings out his curls and makes them look very put together and glossy.

2014-08,4.0,"This mousse is like no other product I've used. It is liquid in the bottle, but not a spray. It is called a mousse, but is really a foam. It smells like the rest of this line (coconut), but the smell doesn't linger. It fades, leaving only a light, faint smell of the original. I have used this as my only &quot;setting&quot; product for my 2c/3a hair and had good results. It gives enough hold to prevent frizz, but doesn't define. I have fairly defined waves/curls on their own, but need frizz control and clumping help. This rocked for that. I have used on both wet and dry hair, having good results both times. I have also used this as second day reviver, and it works well. This leaves no crunch, and not much residue. My hair is softer/smoother with other products, but this has the huge benefit of not feeling like my hair is coated in product, which I prefer. I do wish it left my hair feeling more conditioned, but it seems to neither moisturize nor dry it out, which I'll take. I always start my hair routine with an oil to smooth, soften, and seal, and when using this mousse this is the only product I layer on top. I do not rely on this in humidity or wind (I live in the desert), as it doesn't hold up. Overall, I will purchase again to have as a light hold, to revive second day hair, or simply as a touch up product that won't leave crunch, residue, washes out well, and overall is impossible to mess up on amount used. 

As a note, this works best if you SHAKE THE BITTLE BEFORE PUMPING. Shaking really makes it come out in a nice foam. I shake a few times, pump 3-4 times, apply, and repeat. I only had issues with it being liquid before I found that shaking makes all the difference! ",Nourishing Coconut Milk Weightless Mousse

I have type 2B curly hair and although this product isn't meant for scrunching or for having long-lasting hold, it smells scrumptious and leaves my hair soft and toussled. To get my curly hair to the wavy, toussled level, though, I had to use a few different products to keep the hold in. If you just use this product alone, it won't shape hair whatsoever.

This is an all around fantastic styling product which I imagine would work well for many different types of hair--it is lightweight and non-greasy, but still strong enough to smooth frizzy hair while making it more brushable and easier to detangle. It also makes hair shiny--I don't need to use any serum or gloss afterward! It provides light hold at best, though, so if you're looking for something that will really define and hold a style, this isn't it. Think of it more as a product to add silkiness, softness, shine, and manageability to hair. It also has a beautiful light scent (which fades fairly quickly). A true winner!

I have wavy-ish hair that I like to let air dry. My hair is in pretty good condition although it varies on a daily basis as to how nice it looks when it dries, sometimes it goes lovely and wavy/curly and other times it dries with huge kinks and looks horribly messy - I also have the issue that sometimes my hair can be a bit flat. For years now I have been searching for that product which I can put into damp hair and then just leave my hair alone and that will give my hair that extra bit of volume I need while also making my hair go lovely and wavy and keep frizz at bay. I may have been looking for a little bit too much from one product so needless to say I have gone through countless different products, from sea salt sprays to leave-in gels to serums. 
But alas finally I have found just the product i have been searching for! This mousse, at first does not appear promising as it comes out very watery, but I find that makes it easier to run through my hair evenly. It makes my hair frizz-free and accentuates my hair's waviness while adding body to my hair. I find that it makes my hair super soft although sometimes, and this is my only negative for the mousse, I don't like this as it goes so soft that it gets to that unmanageable stage. This stuff also smells gorgeous but sadly the scent doesn't last for long on my hair.

2009-08,4.0,"ORIGINAL REVIEW 01/29/2010
Disclaimer: I've only been using this product for a week, but I've used it several times this week.  This is the first time I've really liked a mousse, because I hate the scrunchy feel of most mousses.  This is totally different.  It's lightweight, non scrunchy,  non sticky and has a great, light coconut scent.  I used it to blow dry with a round brush and make waves with diffuser and it gave me good volume and hold - even the second day after washing my hair.  I think it also repels dirt because my hair isn't very greasy after two days.  I've found the mousse is a lot like the Living Proof products.


UPDATE 06/21/2010
After using this product for 6 months I stand by my review above.  I'm still very pleased with this mousse.  I have medium-long hair and I use it every other day - I use about 3-5 pumps/use.  I'm still using the same bottle I reviewed back in January!  Great value!  
Tip - If your curly/wavy hair looks flat after sleeping on it use a little water to revive the mousse.  I find that scrunching then lightly shaking out my hair brings back the curl and volume.

In July 2013, I started experiencing a clogged tear duct on my left eye. My eye began to constantly tear up, literally tear drops would run down my face constantly. This was so bad I had to carry tissue and dab my eye all day long. Very embarrassing at work and social situations. Not only the dabbing, but my make up would rub off that eye by early morning. I went to three different doctors and my left eye got seriously infected twice. They suspected allergies first, so I one by one eliminated all my make up products. I went without any eye make up, but the problem persisted. I had one doctor put a needle in my tear duct to push saline through to dislodge any blockage, but there was no blockage. My duct was so swollen (on the inside, it was not apparent from the outside) that he had to force the tiny needle in the hole (ouch!). The last doctor I went to was a tear duct specialist and encouraged surgery. She warned that one more infection and I could loose site in my left eye. So I scheduled surgery for 7/28/14, they needed to create a new tear duct for me (serious surgery - 1 week at home and 1 more week without any make up = 2 days no work). At the end of May (2 weeks ago) I ran out of the Pomegranate conditioner and bought another brand of hair products and suddenly my eye recovered 100%. The day after I stopped using it, the entire tear duct issue went away and I cancelled my surgery yesterday. I have noticed that the shampoo and conditioner is no longer available in the stores and wonder if it was quietly pulled off the shelves. In any case, I wanted to post a warning in case anyone else wanted to try this or has these symptoms.

In general, I like the other Organix products, especially the fragrance. 
Main other complaint is with their bottles. You cannot sit them upside down and once they are no longer full, it is difficult to get out the product. ",pomegranate green tea conditioner

2011-08,4.0,"Everyone is complaining about how this product leaves your hair dry and brittle. I can tell you that it is not a conditioner for people with thick, curly, dry, or frizzy hair, because it won't do anything for you. I have straight, limp hair that tends to get oily less than 24 hours after I wash it. I loved the smell and used up my whole bottle, rotating it with other products. It was hard to get used to at first and I couldn't believe that I'd spent $7 on a product that did nothing - so I read the instructions. They say to leave the product in your hair for a few minutes, I think it's 3 - 5 minutes. After I started leaving it in for longer, it conditioned and detangled my hair very well. I gave the packaging a 5 because it sat upside down fine in my shower caddy and everything on it is biodegradeable and recyclable.",pomegranate green tea conditioner

2010-08,4.0,"I have no clue why I continue to buy these conditioners as NONE of them have done anything for my hair.  I guess the cute (though cumbersome) bottle gets to me, and the smells are to die for!

This great-smelling conditioner actually DID something for my dry, damaged hair!  Most of the Organix conditioners that I have tried have left my hair less conditioned than after I shampooed, but this one, much to my surprise, conditioned my hair nicely, detangled well, and left it smelling fantastic. 

The only reason that I won't rate it a five is because I had to use a ton of it to fully saturate my hair, and for the price, I simply cannot afford to go through two bottles in a week (my hair isn't crazily long or thick at all, either, so people with hair types such as those should probably avoid this, or buy five at one time if it is affordable for them), so I am slightly disappointed that I cannot use it more often.  

The smell is so clean and refreshing.  Almost energizing.  Kind of a citrus-y scent with a light perfume.  I love it.  I wish I could afford to use this on a more consistent basis because I would gladly put it in my rotation, but for the price, it isn't worth it.  If it were thicker, maybe.  

As for the packaging- these bottles suck.  Yes, they are adorable and aesthetically appealing, but for utility purposes, they are essentially worthless.  They cannot be tipped over because the cap is domed, so getting the last 1/3rd of it out of the bottle is enraging enough to make me chuck it into the garbage (only to dig it out later out of desperation).  They need to FLATTEN THE CAPS on these things.  My god.  I usually don't whine about packaging, but these are ridiculous.

My hair is very fine and I need something to make my long hair less frizzy and dry and make it a bit stronger and heavier.

I have thick, curly hair that I flat iron daily to keep it tame and AS A SMOOTHER for dry flat ironed hair it adds a little greasy feel to my hair and does not add the softness like the Pureology. The smell is very very nice though. 

However, I do like it very much as heat protection for my just washed hair and I plan to use it for flat ironing from now on. The flat iron glides nicely over it and it gives my hair a nice shine. I like this much better than the spray on heat protection, even the Pureology. For some reason it does not make my hair greasy when it is the first product I use. Perhaps when combined with other product later, it doesn't mix well. I am still glad I tried it and will use it it for my initial flat ironing.

how i use it: I towel dry my hair a bit, then when it's 50-60% wet, i rub a quarter sized bit through my hair, and blow dry till i'm 100% dry, then i take a bit more and put it where i need the protection, and follow up with the flat iron. I'm left with hair smooth as silk, no fly aways, (unlike with CHI) and shiny gorgeous hair. For reference, i'm a guy with medium-longish hair, highlighted. I dont like all of it though, the smell is very fruity, not that it's a bad smell, its just that it really over powers all my other styling products, (my shu essence, and KS elixir) i asked a few friends to smell my hair a few hours later and they said it smelled fruity. I'm not a fan of that, but i guess it's not so bad. Another gripe i have is the packaging, i HATE it, the bottle is obnoxious and the hole for the product to come out is dead set in the center of an oval, it's hard to get it out without seeping all over the whole package, maybe they should do a pump like shu or something that looks nicer, i still won't take any lippies away for those points. not too expensive either, definitely a breath of fresh air from my 50$ elixir ultime. Oh! i almost forgot, even though i wash my hair every other day, i need to clarify once a week, this seems to build up even if you use a shampoo, nothing a clarifying shampoo can't get rid of, but look out for it if you plan to use this very often.


Update: taking away a my 5 lippie rating . This DoeS make my hair feel a bit thicker(Maybe it's the keratin? Welcomed since I have fine hair) but it makes my hair flat and limp at the end of the day.

2011-08,5.0,"I was walking thru my local grocery store and seen something new from Organix.  The bottles were a metallic black with hotpink sparkles...I had to look.  Organix invented a new line shampoo, conditioner, styling oil and a mask in the formulation of Awapuhi Ginger. Well they only had the shampoo and conditioner, and the price was steep...so I wound up going to Waldgreens and got it on sale!  I wound up trying out the styling oil. I have to say I am soooooo in love with this product.  It makes my hair so soft and shiny. And the scent is so pretty!  After finishing my hair...I felt like I got a blowout in Hawaii.  This Organix line is so brillant and its fractions of the cost of the bigger brands its modeled after.  I am looking foward to trying out the matching shampoo, conditioner and mask!  I cant wait to write the next review. :-)  ",Reparing Awapuhi Ginger Dry Styling Oil

I think I was tricked by the name and the pretty package. Around the time I started using this product I also started breaking out on my hairline on my neck, and a few spots actually on my scalp.

2013-08,3.0,"With a name like that, this product makes some lofty claims. I'm not usually a sucker for such marketing gimmicks, but I figured I'd give it a try. The product had  a faint pleasant but unidentifiable sent. It has a rich, creamy texture, but I had to use about an ounce to work through my thick, long hair, which seemed like a lot. I used this treatment 2-3 times a week for the past 3 weeks and while my hair seems slightly shinier and softer, I didn't notice much of a change in the amount of breakage or split ends, which was disappointing.

I will probably use it up, but I will definitely not repurchase.  I have been seduced by a number of Organix products but I have failed to find one that lived up to its promises.

2013-08,1.0,I bought this because I loved the way it smelled and there was a coupon for it. It looked thick and creamy so I thought it would work especially since it is pricier than most other drugstore conditioners. But this conditioner DID NOT do its job at all. I must have used half the bottle trying to get the tangles out of my hair and it still did not work! And let me just say that I have fine straight hair.

I wash my hair every day so I guess if there is something wrong with my hair it could be that it is oily. This product dried out my hair like nothing I've ever felt. After using the conditioner, I couldn't run my fingers through my hair to save my LIFE! Blow drying was a nightmare because my hair felt sticky and disgusting.

I stocked up! 
Some have complained of tangles. I have very long hair and so I expect tangles even after conditioning. I use a detangler, {Focus 21 Seaplasma is an amazing one and cheap} and then follow through with Organix Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil.

2012-08,5.0,This stuff is fantastic.  I already own the Argan oil body lotion from the same line and love it so when I saw these on sale I snatched up the this scent as well.  I was a little worried this would have that fake cheap and overwhelming coconut scent a lot of products use but this stuff smells wonderful.  More subtle and complex than other coconut scented products you can purchase in a drug store.  The scent is softer than the Argan scent so I believe it will work better when I wear perfume because it won't vie for attention with it.  It also works wonderfully.  I smooth this on and my skin soaks it up and feels instantly smooth and moisturized but not greasy at all.  There is the most subtle of subtle shimmer to it.  I believe the Argan has a bit more shimmer than this scent but neither has very much.  I hope this was not on sale because its being discontinued because this is my new favorite lotion and body wash.,nourishing coconut milk and hibiscus blossom creamy body lotion

Its only good quality was its heavenly scent, which was pretty enjoyable. It smells all vanilla-ey and reminded me of cookies and cake batter which was divine. But unfortunately, the smell faded pretty quickly once my hair dried. ",Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner

Right now i'm just trying to use it up with its matching shampoo. I'd say if you are like me and only intrigued by the scent, just go for the shampoo and skip the awful conditioner.",Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner

Every boy I've dated commented on how my hair smells after using this (one ex said it reminded him of Count Chocula cereal, another of whiskey in a positive way).  Unfortunately, its conditioning properties are pretty lackluster.  It's pretty cheap, but because I have to use so much to feel properly conditioned I wind up motoring through a bottle very quickly, and I have to supplement with a deep conditioner a few times a week.  I've scoured the stores and the internet and have yet to find a conditioner that approximates the smell of this.  Since they came out with the shine serum I've been using that to supplement my hair smell instead of the conditioner, so that kind of works.",Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner

My hair IS very, very damaged, but I have honestly bought conditioners for one dollar (used generally for co-washing) that have left my hair feeling better.  

I wanted to like it, but could not.  I TRIED to like it.  I tried leaving it in for one minute, five minutes, twenty minutes, using it twice or three times within one shower, etc, and nothing made this stuff work as it claimed it would.    

Oh, and the bottle design is repugnant as well.  It's also kinda difficult to coax this stuff from the bottle.  Would not recommend.  ",Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner

2009-08,5.0,"I love the Organix Vanilla Silk line. Vanilla is my favorite scent, and I love being able to use a shampoo and conditioner that complements my body lotions and perfume.


I originally bought this along with the shampoo because I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo; I chose this one in particular because it smelled divine. It distributes evenly on my hair and rinses out without problem. This conditioner leaves my hair nice and soft.


The Vanilla Silk Conditioner is creamy and soft, with a very smooth texture. It comes out of the bottle rather easily, unlike some conditioners that stick to the bottom of the bottle like tacky glue.


While the packaging is nice to look at, it's not very functional. The tops of the bottles are round, so when I get close to the end I can't stand the containers upside down. I've tried building little forts from beauty products to keep the bottles standing on their heads, but at some point it all topples over. This means getting the last of the product out is more difficult than it should be, but with much shaking and bottle slamming it is possible.

I am on my second or third bottle now. I'll continue to buy Organix Vanilla Silk forever. I think I would literally die if this was ever discontinued.",Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner
2009-08,1.0,"So I was silly and bought this product because it smelt nice, before reading any reviews.


I have found it totally unusable as a regular conditioner as it makes my hair very tangled and dry- much worse than it is when I don't use conditioner at all. It's truly awful, and something I have never experienced in a conditioner before. To avoid rendering this product a total waste of money, I have been using it every-now-and-then before shampooing, on the mid-lengths of my hair, hoping it will provide some nourishment. I then shampoo and condition my hair with another conditioner. 


Another thing I should note is that the scent does not linger after the hair has been rinsed. I will not repurchase.",Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner
2009-08,4.0,"I like this conditioner, but it's not one of my favorites.  It smells great and kept my hair silky and soft.  I do not use it with the matching shampoo, which I did not like very much.  I don't have any problems with tangled hair like other reviewers have mentioned.  I apply in the shower after shampooing, let it sit for several minutes, then rinse.  However, the packaging isn't that great, it can be difficult to get out the conditioner after several uses plus it doesn't last very long.  Too bad you can't turn it upside down. I will continue to repurchase this anyway because I like how my hair is with it.

edit 2/5/2011
I can no longer find it locally in the vanilla scent, which makes me quite sad.  Some of the other scents smell nice, but they don't seem to work the same in my hair.  Mostly I miss the heavenly vanilla scent from this conditioner.",Tahitian Vanilla Silk Conditioner

2009-08,1.0,"I wanted to like this, I really did. I chose this because they do not test on animals. I've been slowly making the switch as my old products ran out. Previously, I used Aussie, but I missed the memo that they were bought out by Procter &amp; Gamble. The smell of this is heavenly. It's just amazing. I read reviews on here first, so I knew not to expect any slip but to still give it a fair shot. 

My main issue with this is how tangled my hair was every time I got out of the shower. I have just past shoulder length curly/wavy hair. I'm not a baby about tangles either. But this conditioner made me have to go out and by a separate detangler. I could not get a comb through my hair without getting a massive headache. I don't think everyone would have this experience because having curly hair has a lot to do with it. But it killed it for me.

Aside from that, nothing about this amazing. You do have to leave it in for the required time. It didn't really have any affect on my hair. Same level of frizz, same texture. Overall, just very blah. But for the price, I think I can find better.

You DO need to leave it in for the 3-5 mins they recommend.  If you aren't getting a good result, try following the directions...don't expect this to work instantly like a lot of them do.  It needs to sit so that the oils and proteins have a moment to sink into your hair.  That said, it makes my hair pretty easy to brush through and leaves it super soft and shiny, like silk.  It also leaves me totally frizz free, even on rainy days.  I've gotten tons of compliments on my hair while using Organix (both versions).  I love this stuff, and for the price, it can't be beaten.

I lightly swipe my hands over the roots of my hair to combat the frizz and then I leave the conditioner on for AT LEAST 5 minutes. My hair always rinses silky and no frizz.

It's pretty silky to apply, but it's seems to rinse too cleanly, leaving my hair without enough slip.

2012-08,5.0,"This serum is the bomb dot com. 


I find it hilarious that it has such low reviews, but I feel bad for the product's rep because the main ones reviewing it are people whose hair was not ideal for this serum. I'm talking to you, fine haired, straight haired ladies (and gents?). Now my hair is the furthest from fine and the furthest from straight that there is, so this stuff is perfect. I use it before a blow dry and then use a little more before I flat iron, brushing it through my hair with my denman and working section by section. It smells wonderful, it leaves my hair feeling silky smooth, helps detangle, and adds shine while legit holding down the frizz. It has me whipping my hair back and forth like I'm in a loreal commercial. 


This serum is cheap, at $5.99 before tax, and you don't need much (I have never been able to get away with &quot;dime sized&quot; amounts of any product in my life until this) so it lasts a while. I highly recommend it for my fellow curly-kinky, thick haired ladies, but for those with finer hair textures, I'd advise you to pass on this because it really can weigh hair down. It is my favorite serum of all time though, and I definitely plan on repurchasing. ",Vanilla Silk Serum
2012-08,3.0,"This smells yummy and does make the hair soft. But I think it's just too much for my fine hair. I need more of a &quot;mist&quot; type of oil/serum I guess. Even used just on the ends, it is a little heavy for finer hair. But I think it would be great if you have super thick or porous ends.",Vanilla Silk Serum
2012-08,4.0,"I bought this serum only because it is organic and is sulfate/paraben free. I use it religiously whenever I straighten my hair, and it does a good job in making my hair smooth ! I just wish this serum protects my hair from heat styling tools though. But nonetheless, it's great! :D",Vanilla Silk Serum
2012-08,2.0,This was very sticky and did not do much for frizz or smoothing. It did smell yummy but there are better drugstore products. I think I will try the Coconut serum from this brand next.,Vanilla Silk Serum
2012-08,3.0,"to be honest, i had high hopes for this product - i mean it's vanilla silk! the name of it is like screaming 'nourishing every strand, giving soft silky hair' For the product itself, i'd rate it a 7/10. It's not the best, but then again, it did help a little for my damaged ends. on the ultimate plus side, the packaging allows you to 'lock' the pump - handy for travelling. Plus it's smells really good! i usually apply it after washing up at night, when the hair is slightly damp. and when i wake up the next morning, i have this lingering vanilla scent in my hair. the scent is definitely the selling point ;) I wouldn't repurchase this though, because I could get like coconut oil which is 10 times cheaper, but works 10 times better! ",Vanilla Silk Serum
2010-08,5.0,"I've been using this product for a year now and I am loving it! It took a few tries to get the timing and amount of product I need just right, but once I did it was SO worth it! 
I used to keep my hair up all day every day in an elastic and that in combination with a hormonal imbalance led to very weak, dry, broken hair. You could see a line of breakage where I wore the elastics. Once I noticed I stopped wearing my hair in elastics all the time and looked for something to help repair it. I chose this product because it smelled fantastic and had a rebate available. I'm very glad I did choose it. 
Within a month of use I was getting comments from my family that my hair looked better and healthier. I have never felt my hair softer than when this product is in it! On days when I don't wear it my hair is still noticeably softer, but not as soft. 
My hair is long, close to mid-back and I use a pump and a half when my hair is about 1/2 way dry. I always always always air dry my hair, and I wonder if this product doesn't work best that way. Since I mastered the amount I need in my hair I have had no problems with it looking greasy and there's no buildup. 
This is a terrific product. I will definitely be keeping this around!",Vanilla Silk Serum
2010-08,5.0,"My mom gave me this because she got it for free but didn't need it. I love it. It smells nice, but the best part is how shiny and healthy my hair looks when I use it. I have very damaged hair due to bleaching, but now I'm trying to give it a little TLC by not dying it anymore or using much heated styling tools. That being said, styling products are a must for me if I want my hair to appear put-together. Who likes frizz? I don't, and this gets rid of it pretty well. It also doesn't break me out, which is vital.",Vanilla Silk Serum
2010-08,5.0,"I do not think people know how to use these serums correctly. I have used the coconut milk an the vanilla silk, the vanilla being my favorite. It is best if you do have atlesat medium thickness to your hair. Your hair needs to be more than damp (though not soaking when you apply this) i used 3-4 pumps for hair that is thick and just past my shoulder blades. You never should apply it past the bottom of your ears, otherwise it will look too greasy. Then it needs to be spread evently through out and then combed through a couple times while you let it air dry (which makes my thick, coarse hair look like it was blown out, all soft and frizz free) the smell is very strong and people around you often think they smell cupcakes, it thinks its decadent and very effective if used correctly. Also, if you twist your hair while its wet it dries even more nicely with this product",Vanilla Silk Serum
2010-08,2.0,"Have to agree with akathisia's comment that Organix's strength is their fragrance, rather than performance.  I'd say invest in a bottle of sweet almond oil, which is cheaper, lasts longer, and has loads of different uses to it, than in this stuff.  Did not help my hair, which was dry, frizzy, and battered from the winter.  Didn't make my hair greasy because I have a very, very full head of hair, so a pump of this distributed throughout all my hair is really spread out.  But, could easily see it being greasy on other women's hair.  Will say this for it, it does work as a mild detangler and does have a very nice scent.",Vanilla Silk Serum
2009-08,1.0,"I have to agree with much of the review below except that this has put me off Organix as I bought a conditioner with this too and was quite unimpressed.  This serum was highly fragranced and didn't do anything to make my hair smoother, less frizzy, or easier to manage.  It just sat on top of my hair making it look oily rather giving it a healthy shine.",Vanilla Silk Serum
2009-08,2.0,"It seems to me that the Organix line's strength is the fragrance of the products rather than the performance.

Silk Serum smells great, and application is easy enough: pump out a bit and evenly distribute it through the length of the hair.  I get greasy roots, so I only applied the serum to the bottom 3/4 of my hair.  Besides a bit of a film, I didn't notice any immmediate change.  The label claims detangling powers, but my comb didn't go through any easier than usual.  I let my hair dry naturally, and the result was... well, there wasn't much of one.  My hair looked a little limp, was no shinier than usual, and felt no softer/silkier.  It did smell lovely, though.

I suppose this will come across as a pretty negative review, but really, Vanilla Silk Serum was just &quot;blah&quot; for me, not downright bad.  I won't buy it again, but I won't swear off the whole line either.  ",Vanilla Silk Serum
2012-08,1.0,I love the smell of this and the conditioner. I like the idea of sulfate free products but this caused me to break out all along my hair line in the front and the back of my neck. Took about a week to go away. It also made my head pretty itchy. Even my husband noticed while we were standing somewhere and could see all the bumps. I will never use again! ,Tahitian Vanilla

2011-08,4.0,"Love this Shampoo &amp; Conditioner! I have long, fine hair that I regularly color and this product has done wonders! Having fine hair, I find that almost any shampoo/conditioner will weigh it down and cause excessive oil.... This product combination leaves my hair extremely soft, reduces my time spent blowdrying, adds weightless life, and smells wonderful! I add a few drops of vanilla scented oil to each bottle though as I find the scent does not seem to linger on it's own. While my hair is not &quot;comb through&quot; ready right out of the shower, I dont have any problems detangling before styling and my hair seems to appreciate the absence of heavy silicones anyway. I would def recommend this product however, it is not easy to find! When you do come across it make sure to stock up! Am currently searching for the Vanilla Silk serum.....",Tahitian Vanilla
2011-08,4.0,"I've used almost every hair care product under the sun, from the priciest salon and designer brands to tressemme (sp?) and everything in between. I have shoulder length blonde hair with highlights, very thick and tons of it; because i lighten I need a shampoo/conditioner product that moisturizes without weighing down my hair. As far as drugstore brands go, I have found Organix to offer the best quality at the price point for my hair. And i LOVE the fragrance of this one, but apparently so does everyone else in the New Orleans area (or maybe NO ONE else does) because I have only been able to locate this particular scent 2x in the past year :( 
So, while I prefer the vanilla, I am currently using the coconut shampoo and conditioner (which also leaves my hair smelling lovely and amazing), along with the argon oil repair mask and oil treatment. Great combo for my hair - I airdry and my hair is sleek, shiny, delicious smelling with a bit of wave. At this price, the only thing more I could ask is that the stores in my area stock up on the vanilla already. 
Will continue to purchase. I alternate this with WEN lavender (I use the WEN 1-2x a week with the argon repair mask) - because sometimes I just have to have the classic shampoo experience! ",Tahitian Vanilla
2010-08,3.0,"I'm pretty sure the vanilla shampoo was the one I had.  So I'll just review organix shampoo in general hear.  Not that great.  It smells good, but that's all I remember liking about it.",Tahitian Vanilla
2010-08,3.0,"I absolutely loved the smell and for the short time I used it my hair did seem stronger at the roots, but it was drying and made even my short/medium fine/thick hair feel tangled. 

Right now the best SLS/cruelty-free shampoo I've used is Down Under Naturals Nudes Invigorating shampoo (cleans hair very well without overdrying - important as my hair/scalp can get either too dry or oily/clogged very easily - and lathers almost as well as shampoos with SLS while needing to use very little to do so. It's also doesn't strip my semi-permanent hair dye - even some SLS-free shampoos can, especially ones with lemon or very harsh citrus or drying essential oils - and is very cheap for the kind of shampoo it is if you can find it - in Canada it's sold at Sobey's and Lawtons for $5. They also make a volumizing/clarifying shampoo that works really well without too much drying and a moisturizing shampoo that doesn't seem to clean as well but is very gentle and actually moisturizing, and all of their products smell good though not as absolutely delicious as Organix). 

Actually, Down Under Naturals has the same parent company as Live Clean (I haven't tried them yet but maybe they work similarly, and I believe they're available in the US now too). 

EDIT 1/19/11: I've tried the Live Clean Green Earth Invigorating Shampoo that seems to clean very well without stripping the hair (and has an amazing lather and feel very similar to the Down Under Naturals Nudes Invigorating Shampoo I've been using, though that lacks dye and is has a bit more of a natural scent), and the Fresh Water Moisturizing Conditioner and Leave-In Conditioner (I really like the Leave-In, it leaves my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down or making it feel waxy..but doesn't seem to really help too much with frizz that I can see).

I also think I'll give Organix another shot after reading that a lot of people simply needed to use conditioner to detangle after using this because of the egg protein in it (I've read that protein can really dry out hair if it's not balanced with moisturizer after reading up on hair thickening products). And it was nice having my hair smell like vanilla cupcakes.. I'll update after trying this out again.",Tahitian Vanilla
2010-08,4.0,"I was intrigued by the yummy scent and picked both the shampoo and conditioner from walmart. I love the shampoo, but the conditioner is another story..I have short hair so my hair is pretty easy to deal with and it doesn't have any special needs either, all i ask for in a shampoo is to cleanse my hair and scalp without making it a tangled mess..This meets my needs and it makes hair washing a treat because it smells so so good!",Tahitian Vanilla
2010-08,4.0,"Ever just stood there and a girl comes running in your direction with towel dried hair? Right when she passes, her shampoo smells AMAZING right? 

Well, with this shampoo, you'll get that result every time. It smells like vanilla cupcakes! I love it. 

It's pricey for just shampoo alone, but it's worth it. If you scrub really well, your hair will be perfumed for the next two days. If you let the conditioner set in for about 5 minutes, it'll give you a more lasting result.

The smell is the strongest when you let it air dry. 

It's perfect if you're going out later that night. You'll still smell fresh! ",Tahitian Vanilla
2009-08,3.0,"Smells awesome, but isn't worth the extra money you're paying for something that's full of chemicals just like typical drugstore brands.

This also left my hair VERY dry, which is odd because I bought it solely because it didn't contain any sulfates (which are very harsh detergents I avoid but are found in most shampoos and clothing and dish detergent).

Smells good but I won't repurchase.",Tahitian Vanilla
2009-08,5.0,"MY HAIR:
I have medium-long hair that is layered with a very slight wave. I wash my hair every other day so as to not strip it of it's vital moisture. I also rarely blow dry my hair and never straighten it (have only used a flat iron about five times in my entire life). My hair has never been dyed or permed in any way.
THE PRODUCT:
I used this product for a good six months until my bottle ran out (I believe I was on the third bottle at the time). When I went to the local Wal Mart and Target, it was not in stock, but the other scents were. I was not happy with the other scents, so I switched to another brand shampoo. After using the new shampoo for a few months, I realized that it may have been a cause of my worsening acne, so I wanted to switch back to something a little more natural. I went to the local Target in my school's town and bought this shampoo again. BEST idea ever. I've been using it right around three weeks, and combined with my organic black soap and unrefined shea butter (purchased from http://www.hosiaonline.com/), my acne has been getting increasingly better. ALSO, this shampoo left my hair soft and smelling really good when used with the matching conditioner and a little bit of Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Anti-Humidity Smoothing Milk to finish the style.
BOTTOM LINE:
I recommend giving this brand a try, especially if you have acne or want to begin switching to a little more natural products. Don't expect a miracle, but if you go in with the right mindset that this won't make your hair more perfect than anything else, you'll end up loving this brand!
P.S. It's easiest to find at Target, but Wal Mart also carries some of the line.",Tahitian Vanilla
2009-08,2.0,"I really wanted to love this. I love the smell of coconuts and it smells heavenly. I noticed after awhile, though, that my hair got really oily and stringy. I went and got my hair done at a salon in Soho, and the lady told me it wasn't getting the job done. They had to shampoo my hair twice to get my hair clean and to get the coating completely off. I use the shampoo from time to time, as I have a huge bottle from BJ's. But...don't buy it. ",Tahitian Vanilla
2009-08,2.0,"Have to admit, I was a sucker for the packaging- thinking how classy and luxurious it would look against my black and gold italian marble tiling in my bathroom. Alas, for me that is where it ended- having oily hair, which has never been coloured (virgin hair:) I found it was ordinary. It didn't feel like it gave my hair any extra body or life, it pretty much ceased to exist in it's effect on my hair once it was suds at the bottom of the shower.
My boyfriend inherits any products I get bored with or am not crazy about (like backups if he runs out and we haven't topped up his usual shampoo/conditioner) so this shampoo and conditioner ended up sitting in HIS shower after only using this product 3 times... it has since run out, and the bottles are on my shelf back in my bathroom with shower gel in them:) Resourceful!

2009-08,2.0,"I had been using DHC's scalp cleansing shampoo, but with cooler weather, had been noticing my hair had been getting straw-like, even though I had made a point of not washing it everyday.  So, figured this was a good time to finally try a sulfate-free shampoo.
For me, this product works great.  Cleans my hair, though I did have to get used to the lesser lather.  My hair is very smooth and I often forego conditioner with this shampoo.  I do not use this every day, to avoid stripping my hair and scalp.  However, in the summer time, I might consider trying their tea tree oil shampoo if I'm more oily from hot weather.  On a more frivolous note, totally love the smell.
The one downside is the price in relation to the amount of product you get.  Fortunately, it's lasting for a decent amount of time because I'm not shampooing every day, but I do have shoulder-length hair so I do require a fair amount of product.  It's not just Organix that I've noticed this problem with price and amount offered:  it seems like all the sulfate-free shampoos out there are either a)on the pricey side or b)offer a reasonable price like Organix, but not generous with the amount offered per unit.  So, will stick with this shampoo, but wish they offered more product per unit.
Update:  Changed the rating from a four to a two and will not buy again.  While my hair wasn't straw-like with the onset of winter, by mid to late winter, this stuff had my hair very straw-like and frizzy.  Found my husband's sulfate-laden Head and Shoulders is actually gentler than this stuff.  Don't be fooled by the pretty scent.  Actually, think Organix would probably do a better job as a fragrance company than a hair care company.",Tahitian Vanilla
2009-08,4.0,"I love the Organix Vanilla Silk line. Vanilla is my favorite scent, and I love being able to use a shampoo and conditioner that complements my body lotions and perfume.


I originally bought this because I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo; I chose this one in particular because it smelled yummy. I've never had any problems with this shampoo. My hair is thick and oily, and this doesn't strip my hair or leave it feeling greasy.


While the packaging is nice to look at, it's not very functional. The tops of the bottles are round, so when I get close to the end I can't stand the containers upside down. I've tried building little forts from beauty products to keep the bottles standing on their heads, but at some point it all topples over. This means getting the last of the product out is more difficult than it should be, but with much shaking and bottle slamming it is possible.

I like what it does to my hair, but I think my scalp is feeling a little dry and itchy. I may need to alternate this with something for my scalp, but this is definitely a good buy.

I don't comb my hair, I use my fingers gently to comb thru the conditioner. then after I rinse, my curls are silky and bouncy.

2008-08,3.0,"This is an ok shampoo.  Fine, but nothing special, unless using a sulfate free shampoo is really important to you.  If that is the case, this is a sulfate free option that is reasonably priced and widely available.  I'm a bit surprised that a reviewer below said this is hard to find.  Nearly every store in my area carries this line, including Wal Mart, Target, CVS and Walgreens.  Anyway, like every sulfate free shampoo I've tried, this doesn't lather a lot, though I did think the amount of lather was above average compared to other shampoos of this type.  It is heavily scented, and it's a very foody vanilla, so definitely avoid this product if that type of scent makes you gag.  One thing that annoys me about this brand is that the name and marketing suggest that the products are organic.  As far as I can tell, the only organic ingredient in this product is a bit of organic vanilla bean oil.  IMO, any product that suggests it is organic ought to have a significant percentage of organic ingredients.  Rant over.

2007-08,5.0,"I agree with the previous poster:  This shampoo makes me happy when I use it, because the smell is so delicious!  I WISH it lingered, but it really doesn't for me, and I have &quot;layered&quot; using the conditioner and blow dryer treatment as well.

This shampoo foams up fabulously, which is great coming from a sulfate-free product.  I too have used the Shea Butter version, and my hair seems really silky since I have been using them.  The next time there is a good sale on these I am going to try the mandarin version for curly hair.

I am not in love with the packaging, though.  I don't like the shape of the bottles to grab in the slick shower.  I'd suggest a narrower cylindrical shape and an press-flip top.  I can see these products being attractive in opaque bottles similar to the Hempz products.

Definitely give these products a try!",Tahitian Vanilla
2007-08,5.0,"PLEASE LADIES!!!!! Buy this product. I am in fear that it will become discontinued. I'm so in love with this shampoo I could cry. The smell, while it fades through out the day, is so yummy. It makes me so happy when I wash my hair in the morning. YUM. 

The other plus about this shampoo, is that it is an inexpensive SULFATE FREE shampoo that has not faded my hair color what-so-ever. It's so much cheaper than the other salon name sulfate free shampoos (Pureology, Sexy hair concepts). I have tried the Shea Butter one, and I liked that too but absolutely nothing compares to the texture and smell of Vanilla Silk. It also makes my hair soft and sexy throughout the day.

2007-08,1.0,"Found this @ Target with a rebate coupon for both the shampoo + conditioner = free products!  Who can resist?  Wasn't expecting much, since I am a salon shampoo snob *sniff*.  But, hmmmm, not bad.  The sickeningly sweet vanilla fades somewhat, so that's a plus.   The lather is good and rinses clean.  The conditioner is lightweight and also rinses well.  I was skeptical of the cones, but so far so good.  Didn't leave my scalp itchy.  
Lippies off for the fat hard-to-manage bottles, and the fliptop caps which I can see breaking off soon.
For free, though, what fun!  ETA:  left my hair static-y on these winter days..demoted to 1 lippie",Tahitian Vanilla

2007-08,4.0,"I was drawn to the shampoo/conditioner line after sampling the scent.  The scent is exactly like LipSmackers in Vanilla....YUM!   Unfortunately it doesn't linger after the shower.  It contains no harsh ingredients that are often found in drugstore shampoos/conditioners.  Makes my hair really soft, doesn't weigh it down, and is really shiny.  Overall, performs well as far as drugstore shampoos are concerned.

2007-08,3.0,"I had been spying the product for a while, and when it went on sale BOGO I figured why not.  The first couple times that I used this stuff it made my hair feel dry/matted when I was shampooing.  After a few days my hair adjusted and it does not have that yucky feel. My hair is nice and soft, but I think it's still a bit drying.  My hair is getting staticy when I brush it.  I might give the coconut a try, and if I have no luck there it back to Dove.

2007-08,5.0,"I have the shampoo. The smell, yes, is a little overpowerful, but seriously it is amazing! It is creamy and doesn't strip my hair of all the natural oils. Cleans very good. Lots of product (about 13 ounces) for about $7 at Target. I was in a grocery store in AZ and saw this stuff, wanted to get it, but 3 oz rule for airports. Finally went to Target and there it was! This + the Shea Butter cond.=great hair. I got about 10 compliments the day I first used it. mmm",Tahitian Vanilla
2007-08,5.0,"This stuff worked amazing on my hair! Incredible softness, yummylicios scent. My locks look and feel great and well moistured.

2007-08,3.0,"I'm quite happy with how this works for my color-treated, very dry hair, especially given the affordable price. Planning to try one of their conditioners. And I'm a sucker for vanilla scents.

edited -- this vanilla became overpowering for me -- almost like milk gone bad. After a few days I just couldn't take it anymore.",Tahitian Vanilla
2007-08,5.0,"&lt;b&gt;Me&lt;/b&gt;: 20 years old. Decided to give up a losing battle against hair down to my behind; cut it to a couple inches below the shoulder. What's left is much less damaged than what was cut but it still tends to dryness and is quite wavy, can be very unmanageable without the right products. Right now my scalp is the most important detail to take care of...it can get extremely oily and itchy if left to its own devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;The shampoo&lt;/b&gt;: Retails at $7 for 13 ounces. Can be hard to find, I found it at Kroger's, I have heard of people finding it at Target. The shampoo is creamy as opposed to a gel and it is absolutely the best smelling vanilla shampoo I've ever used...it is like a sweet butterscotch smoothie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;My experience&lt;/b&gt;: My mother loves to buy random shampoos and try them out, so there's always a whole repertoire of new ones I've never tried laying around. I always look at their ingredients and my stomach curdles at the sulfates and 'cones. I was pleasantly surprised to find this one had none of that stuff...it is sulfate-free and the one 'cone it contains is water soluble, it washes right off. This was the first one of her new shampoos I felt it was safe to try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I'm very glad I did because it absolutely felt wonderful both on my head and once it was rinsed off. I am shocked at how soft my hair feels when dry, and how nice it left my scalp feeling...there is no unbearably itchy feeling, no cloying oiliness that so many shampoos afflicted on my head as soon as a day after I washed my hair. Using this shampoo I can go several days without cleansing my hair before I feel I have to do it, and a shampoo that makes my scalp AND hair feel wonderful is a revolution, indeed. In fact having this was the catalyst that made me cut off 3/4 of my hair, I didn't want to do it til I had a great shampoo to back me up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have also used their Smoothing Shea Butter and Citrus Mango shampoos. The Shea Butter type seemed to be much the same as this one (and in fact they share almost every ingredient so can be considered pretty much the same) but the Citrus Mango I didn't like...it had a cheap smell, and it seemed less moisturizing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt; DI Water (Aqua), Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Glycol Distearate, Dimethicone Copolyol, Cetyl Alcohol, Cocamide DEA, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquaternium-11, Hydantoin, Silk Amino Complex, Panthenol (Vitamin B-5), Organic Vanilla Bean Oil, Shea Butter, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Fragrance&lt;/i&gt;",Tahitian Vanilla
2007-08,4.0,"(Since there isn't a separate space yet to review the shampoo and conditioner separately, I'm reviewing them together. I would give the conditioner 5 lippies and the shampoo 3 1/2 lippies).&lt;p&gt;

I tried the Tahitian Vanilla shampoo and conditioner. I love the conditioner. It's not my favorite vanilla scent--it's kind of a musky vanilla. It really does not last long, so whether you like /dislike it, it definitely won't last. I love the results. My hair is shiny, smooth, and so healthy looking whenever I use this conditioner. It feels very moisturized. It supposedly has silk amino proteins that seal the cuticle in order to make it silkier and shinier. Love!!&lt;p&gt;

The shampoo is just average. It is sulfate free so it does not really have a decent lather ( which is my preference). I like the results I get with the conditioner when I pair it with a different shampoo. I probably will not buy the shampoo again.&lt;p&gt;

The shampoo and conditioner retail for $6.99 each. I am definitely looking forward to trying their blow dry cream but so far none of the stores in my area have it yet.",Tahitian Vanilla
2007-08,1.0,"Should have known better than to purchase this shampoo (along with the conditioner). I'm not really sure what i expected. The shampoo made my hair feel very tangled. This is not usually the case with Pantene, or even Victoria's Secret shampoo. Moved on to the conditioner, which was worse. Sat in my hair an did nothing. And i used a lot of it. Had to wash it out and use my Pantene intensive hair mask (which as usual did a great job). Would NEVER recommend this to anyone but a bald headed man. And even then, the scent is too Vanilla for me. Not good if you don't like foodie scents in you hair/body products. ",Tahitian Vanilla

2011-08,5.0,"I purchased this after hearing basically a mix bag of reviews - I heard that Organix Shampoo is the best and I also heard it was horrid! I decided to go ahead and purchase this. 

Let's start out with information about my hair; I do not dye my hair, nor use lots of chemicals, nor use lots of heat appliances on it. 

My first purchase among the Organix line was the Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner, and Brazilian Keratin Therapy shampoo and conditioner.. and this Organix Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo (and the Conditioner) are my holy grail!

This stuff actually tames my minor frizz and makes it smell so wonderful. The shampoo one is a bit more drying than the other shampoos in the Organix line, but once you condition your hair it comes out silky and smooth. 

Overall, my verdict is to definitely try the Shea Butter Smoothing line of products, you won't be disapointed.",Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]
2011-08,5.0,"I also was surprised by the bad reviews on this product, although I get that the shampoo alone feels drying. I have thick but fine hair that tends to get puffy and very not-smooth. I was initially a little disappointed, too, but then I made sure to follow the directions on the bottle to keep the conditioner on for at least 3 minutes, make sure to apply the conditioner thoroughly to the parts of my hair that most need smoothing, and rinse thoroughly, unlike I would have previously with conditioners. After playing around with how I use it, I'm in love. My experience with this product honestly has erased my life-long skepticism about the potential benefits of any one product. I started using this shamp/cond 3 mos ago, and my hair has been much softer and smoother ever since. For best results, I use a very small dab of the Organix shea butter smoothing serum. Again, I thought it was worthless at first because it's essentially just oil, but if you figure out the right amount that works for your hair, it has great effects in smoothing and shining. I find it also makes my hair more likely to do what I want. These products aren't the cheapest, but I find they work better than some much more expensive hair care products that I've tried.

When I returned home and washed my hair with this, I was disappointed to see how this left my hair weighed down and tangled compared to what I was using away from home (the SUAVE Almond &amp; Shea Butter one in case you were wondering). So I'm tossing this and switching. Original review is below.

I actually don't think this product is all that terrible. My hair is thick and a bit below my shoulders in length. Texture wise, it is fine and I have a lot of static and flyaways no matter what the season. However, this does become worse in the winter when it is quite dry in my house. The shampoo makes my hair feel very clean, even giving my hair that &quot;squeak&quot; which I wouldn't expect from a shea butter shampoo. It doesn't make my hair smoother than normal (I have yet to find something that does) but it doesn't make it worse. I also have bangs too and it does not make my hair too greasy either (I wash at night). So not the best product ever, but not the spawn of Satan either. Bonus: the scent really lingers in my hair and it smells nice.",Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]
2010-08,1.0,Smoothing? Not so much. Flattening dull hair? Very. So disappointing. It seemed so great. SLS free. Great smell. Decent price. Just a big no. My hair was lifeless and I didn't even finish the bottle.,Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]
2010-08,2.0,"I've previously used the coconut Organix, and should have learned my lesson. While these products promise a lot and they do smell great and have cute packaging - they just don't deliver. The shea butter products seemed okay at first. After shampooing, my hair was extremely tangled and felt stripped - but after the conditioner, it felt silky and soft. I didn't notice any particular &quot;smoothing&quot; ability though. After about 2 weeks' use, my hair was dried out with frizz and I gave these to my husband to finish them up. My hair tends to be somewhat dry, and I only wash about twice a week. These might be okay if you have oily hair and only wash once a week, but if your hair is at all dry or has any damage - avoid. The shampoo strips your hair and the conditioner isn't hydrating enough to recover it. Won't repurchase.",Shea Butter Smoothing Shampoo [DISCONTINUED]
2010-08,4.0,"I actually like this BUT I DO NOT use the conditioner in the line. I rotate this with 2 of the other scents and always use a sulfate shampoo on Sunday to get any buildup out. I also only wash every other day. For conditioner when I use these, I use Dove's deep moisture conditioner.

As far as sulfate-free shampoo, I like it alot. It suds up and doesn't upset my scalp. I've tried both the Sally Beauty Hair One (Wen knock-off) sulfate free cleansing conditioner and the Loreal sulfate free (can't remember if it was EverPure or EverStrong) and both made my scalp sensitive, itchy, and sore after one use. This does not.


Of the 3 scents I have in this, this makes my hair...nicest? It does smooth it a bit, as indicated, but I still need heavy-duty conditioner. It also smells really good but so far, scent-wise, the Coconut is my favorite.

If you have slightly curly dry hair (naturally or because you abuse it) then you should give it a try. I paid 4 bucks for it cause I had a coupon but it is only about dollars so the price is very encouraging.

2012-08,1.0,"I was looking for a new shampoo/conditioner and brought this. It smells divine! I love the smell of mandarin oranges, since it reminds me of my childhood. But, my hair did not feel clean after using this. It did not lather well (probably because it has no sulfate). It smells great, but that's about it. It did not clean my hair and it did not make it any softer or healthier. Actually, I think it made my hair worse. I have curly hair, btw.

I bought this product because I liked the way it smelled and since my hair is fine and heat damaged I thought that this organix ""replenishing"" shampoo would help; however, I was very wrong. First of all, it lathers badly. Secondly, it left my hair feeling dry and strawlike and the smell does not stick. 

Organix products are fairly expensive but luckily I got this on sale at a local drugstore. I will never buy this product again. '>Never, never, never again.

I have no qualms with this product. In fact, I really like it! It leaves my long hair feeling squeaky clean and not overly dry or oily. The smell is citrusy, with a hint of an olive oil tang that does not bother me at all. 
I love Pantene and use it regularly, but I find this product is a nice break and change of pace for my hair. Does not tend to weigh my hair down as Pantene can do if I'm not careful in applying it with a light hand and not to my roots.
Worth a try. I got it buy one get one free at CVS and it's a keeper. Would repurchase again on sale.

Edit** I am loving this product!! It leaves my hair so weightless and yet shiny and smooth. Truly a great fit for me. Reaching for it now more and more frequently. I think in the warmer months, my hair can't tolerate the products that pile on the moisture it craves more in the winter. This stuff is great.",Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo

2008-08,4.0,"On the fence about this one, as I always seem to get weigh down on my hair whenever I use these shampoos. The scent of this is wonderful, kind of orangey and it supposed to &quot;heal&quot; split ends and frayed, damaged hair. I don't know about these claims, but it does seem to defrizz my hair and smoothes it to some extent. As with the Shea Butter Shampoo, my hair feels slightly coated and a bit oily, maybe it's the olive oil factor, don't know. Overall though, this seems to clean my hair pretty well, though I would like it to be shinier. Not a great shampoo in my opinion, but not bad either. Haven't decided whether I would buy this again, love the bottle though!",Mandarin Olive Oil Shampoo
2012-08,4.0,"Note:  This is a mostly natural shampoo/conditioner so you need to leave it in your hair longer.  I just got the conditioner and it says that you should leave it in 3 to 5 minutes.  If you don't leave it in long enough, it won't penetrate and it's like you're not using conditioner.

That being said...

Pros:  Smells amazing, makes my hair really soft and shiny

Cons:  Have to use a lot and a bit more &quot;high-maintenance&quot; than your average conditioner with the waiting times, you can probably buy better conditioner for less money

I was drawn to both of these factors when I picked up this shampoo and conditioner, but at $11.99 each I expected a bit more than the straw I was left with. I was really disappointed as the packaging emphasis the effect on your hair more than the fact it was a shampoo with organic ingredients in it. The conditioner is so thin I may as well have rubbed water in my hair. I'm really disappointed in this, will be returning to my regular set. Buyer beware!

I originally used Organix Coconut conditioner a few months ago but it was useless on my highlighted highlighted hair so i gave it away.

Today i was in RiteAid and was looking around for a product that smelled just like the conditioner and low and behold i almost fell over when i saw that this exists!

The smell is DIVINE!! Its like sweet honeyed coconut with some toasted almonds thrown in and a touch of vanilla. OMG! If i were making a dessert, this is what i'd like to make.

Very moisturizing also.

Only downside is that the top leaks ever so slightly.

If you're looking for coconut scent, this is it!",Coconut Milk & White Lotus Body Mist
2012-08,4.0,"I purchased this because I absolutely loved the scent of the Coconut Milk Shampoo (which is an amazing shampoo, by the way). Although this mist does have some white lotus in it, it seems like the same scent of Coconut Milk Shampoo to me. 
Basically the only ingredients in this mist that are contributing to the scent is coconut extract and white lotus extract. So, there aren't really any &quot;top notes,&quot; &quot;middle notes,&quot; or &quot;bottom notes,&quot; but meh. It still smells great! I just spritz two spritz in my hair so that whenever people ask me what scent it is, I just tell them that it's my new shampoo lol because the Coconut Milk shampoo scent doesn't linger in my hair. And, honestly, I'd rather my hair smell like coconut than my neck/wrist (I prefer actual perfume for my neck).
This is a REAL coconut scent, by the way. It's not that cheap/fake coconut scent in tanning lotions.
I rated this a 4 because of the poor packaging. The bottle it comes in is poorly made. It does spray an even, fine mist but it also leaks out of the bottom part of the spritzer.
But other than that, I love it! (: I'm so glad I managed to snatch the last bottle of this at Rite Aid! (: The price was $10; very reasonable!

2012-08,4.0,"I'm addicted the fragrance. It's just so delicious!! As a body spray, it isn't the best--the fragrance doesn't last long, it doesn't really 'moisturize' or do anything really.  Plus the spray bottle is kind of defective--when you spray, it leaks out of the screw-on part and drips all over.  Bottle--pretty but not functional.
I have been so in love with the fragrance and natural ingredients that I now use it in my hair.  It makes a fabu hair product!! I use it as a finishing spray so I have that delicious fragrance in my hair all day.  It adds some texture to my hair and enhances the curls and bounciness.  There is some kind of alcohol in it but I've found that it isn't drying at all.
I definitely will be buying this again!  I hope though, they'll fix the issue with the bottle--I don't get why it's so drippy and sloppy--Other than that, it's a great thing!  ",Coconut Milk & White Lotus Body Mist

It does have a lovely smell and does soften my skin a bit (although it gives a slight burning sensation when applied on freshly shaven legs), but the packaging makes it so inconvenient to use. It comes in a round spray bottle that gets smaller at the top (right where you want to grip it to spray) and if you grip it too hard you'll drop it. If you try to spray upside down or at an angle big drops drip out and run down your hand which I find very inconvenient especially for a body spray.

I was previously using Dove bars, but I like to try new things when I finish what I was currently using. I ordered this from Amazon for about 13 dollars, and when it finally came in the mail, I was so excited to try it.

The smell is slightly coconut, but it's overpowered by the smell of the sugarcane, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I really wanted a strong, sweet coconut smell for the summer. The body wash doesn't really lather, which I don't like, because I feel as though I have to use more of it to feel clean. I use exfoliating gloves, and they can create a lot of lather even if I don't use a lot of product.

In terms of the product itself, it cleans without drying out the skin, and leaves my whole body feeling and looking smooth, young and bright.

The lather is too... I had to use about 1 palm size for my shoulder length hair. I felt that it was not enough and I don't think I can get use to this kind of consistency whereby it is not thick. (sorry for poor explanation!!)

It was strange that the top felt dry and the middle felt ok-ok and the ends felt fab. I think it is too drying for me. (BTW, I have a dry scalp and oily hair.)

I'd never expect to NOT have to follow a shampoo with conditioner, so this isn't a negative in my mind.  

I have a really oily scalp, and I don't think this shampoo provides as much cleansing as I really need to avoid being oily on the 2nd day.

2010-08,4.0,"I have used a few bottles of this now. I really love the way it smells and how soft if makes your hair feel. It also helps with fly aways and frizz. Just a word of warning: you do need to be careful to avoid your roots.. this is greasy and a little goes a long way especially near the roots of your head! Otherwise you will look a little greasy.

The self heating is fun, but i'm not sure it is any different than the non self heating version. I've used both and might slightly prefer the non heating because it just seems odd that it heats up. Personal preference though. There really isn't much of a difference other than the heat factor.",Coconut Milk Self Heating coconut oil

It's so loose that its kinds hard to know that you evenly distributed it but I guess I did OK.  I shampooed then I used about 2 quater sized amounts on my thick mid-back lenght wavy hair.  Then I used conditioner.  This was the only thinged I changed in my hair care routine and I really noticed a difference.  Most products I'm like 'I dont really now, I thiiinnkk it's helping?'  But this one I noticed on the first application.  My hair just felt silker after the the shower and the next morning my hair retained it curls and didnt frizz up after I reapeatly ran my fingers through it (I dont use a hair brush, which by the way I havent had any split ends to speak of since I ditched the brush about 2 years ago and I really attribute that to my hair being so healthy and I use a microfiber towel) (I get my hair trimmed about 2x a year so you'd think I'd have a ton of split ends when I go for a trim but I have none and believe me a few years ago I had horrible hair and would sit and go through the ends myself and cut the split ends hair by hair.)

2009-08,5.0,"This is a miracle in a bottle for anyone who has dry hair that becomes ratty, stringy, frizzy, poufy, etc.  My hair's bipolar: incorruptably straight and blah on the underlayer, but the top goes past wavy into naturally curly (and messy, frizzy, and generally awful).  Trying to calm my fine, dry top layer into something silky, smooth, and shiny is usually a lost cause!  This coconut oil was a godsend the very first time I used it.  

You put the product in your hair before you shower, then shampoo + condition like usual.  After the shower, your hair is silky smooth, shiny, and soft.  I let mine air-dry and for the first time in my life my curls were beautiful: naturally soft to the touch (not crunchy, dry, or frizzy), almost completely frizz-free, and I could still run my hands through my hair without hitting tangles or turning into a pouf-head.  I showered last night and this morning my hair is still silky, glossy, smooth.  

I put it on when I get out of the gym, so it has ~15min on my head before I shower, and that seems to be enough.  I'm sure people with heavy hair would want to use it less frequently; others may want to leave it on longer.  It's probably YMMV in the way it's used.  However, this product is a miracle!  Don't overlook it, seriously.

I love the shampoo and I wanted to try this product and I am so glad I did. My hair is left super shiney, soft and silky and it has new life and sheen. What I like the most about this is that it doesn't feel heavy on my fine hair and that it doesn't make the hair feel crunchy as many hair oils do. Wow!

2008-08,5.0,"I believe this stuff has helped to save my hair.  I use the nourishing coconut milk anti-breakage serum on my hair (only a few drops) after I shower and I can't believe how healthy my hair has become.  I've been using it for about 4-5 weeks now, after I have gotten my haired dyed, then stripped, and my hair has never looked better.  I have extra body and my hair is starting to re-curl, which it never does in the cold, dry, Chicago winters.  The bottle may look small, but you only need to use a little bit, so I know my original bottle is going to last a LONG time.  It is a bit expensive for a drugstore product, but I was able to find it at CVS for a buy one Organix product get the second free, so it ended up being a pretty good deal.  

I also bought the Organix nourishing coconut milk self-heating coconut oil that is supposed to be applied to dry hair before showering.  II don't have much time before showers so I decided to try applying it at night before bed, then showering in the morning.  I don't recommend it.

It smells delicious and comes in a little pump, which is nice, you are supposed to briskly rub a few drops between your hands and then apply to hair before you shower, it doesn't say in the directions but I assume this is before shampooing as well.  My hair is long and slightly dry at the ends from highlighting, but I did not notice much of a difference after using this, and I tried a few times with varying amounts.  My last resort is to really slap it on and wrap a hot towel around my head for an hour.  I will update if that does any good, but for the most part I say save your money, get the real thing or just use olive oil.  (smells nice, though - but if you are washing it out, scent is pointless)

Well, I was having no luck with this using it in small amounts, so I put a ton of it in my hair before bed and slept with it in, washing it out at about 10am the next morning..It took about 2 latherings to get it all out, and my hair was very soft and smooth, but static-y as all heck afterwards.  Next time I will just slather it on the ends and leave it in all night.  BTW, my hair is fine but I have alot of it, and I highlight but am letting it grow so it is pretty damaged on the ends.

Now I use ALOT of conditioner and it does manage to condition my hair a little, but not enough to justify the price.

I will definitely compare the two in an updated post on both reviews when it is time.

THE REVIEW: This is very similar to a conditioner. It works well, but I didn't expect much anyway from this product. My hair is not damaged, dry, brittle, dyed... I have VERY healthy hair. I did notice a slight difference though.. My hair looks more shiny and healthier. Like I just got a hair cut type of look. I don't like the packaging, due to the fact I have to dig out the product with my hands.

Will I repurchase? Yes I would and I recommend this.

After a few days my hair would start to turn crunchy from all the protein in it. I decided what I really needed was a weekly treatment with coconut oil in it, so I decided to try the Instant Repair Treatment. I am really impressed with it. My hair came out soft, shiny, and with no sign of split ends. The results lasted a few days, which is pretty much what I was expecting. And of course it smells divine.

* PROS
- Really nice, sweet coconut smell. Unfortunately it doesn't last, which I expected it to.

* CONS
- Very thick pastey consistency. Hard to scoop out of the tub, and very hard to distribute through hair. Doesn't run through smoothly like a regular conditioner, and when I wash it off my hair feels coarse and I need to use my normal conditioner to untangle my hair.
- Didn't notice a significant difference in my hair.

I recommend getting the other products in this line though (not the shampoo/conditioner).

I was really lured by the scent, it is so delicious smelling but I rather condition my hair in something that smells worse and works great rather than the opposite. This product reminds me of those V05 conditioners that they used to sell, not sure if they still sell that brand somewhere but I remember seeing them on the shelves for like 80 cents or 99 cents a piece at walmart.
