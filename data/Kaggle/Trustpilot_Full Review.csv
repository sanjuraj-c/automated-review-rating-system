PetFlow ,George Romer," May 13, 2023",14 hours ago,Value added online retailer,"I shopped the product, Milk Bone Pill Pouches for several weeks.

PetFlow ,Janie," May 13, 2023",A day ago,In Stock at PetFlow !,PetFlow was able to ship an important dog food product that was not available from other on-line merchants.

PetFlow ,Nan R.," May 11, 2023",3 days ago,The company was very responsive to…,"The company was very responsive to problems I had manoeuvering their site. The shipping was well within reasonable expectations.
My only issue has to do with the site not being easy for me actually 'maze-like' in its degree of difficulty. I wish it would be more customer friendly for people like me who are not accustomed to not being able to 'just go to the page I need' without all the precision points having to be passed to get there.
The selection of goods for a smaller company is impressive and prices are very competitive with other larger companies."

PetFlow ,CATHERINE NOCELLA," May 10, 2023",4 days ago,Great Service,This was my first purchase from Petflow and I am impressed. First when I set up my my new account I had issues with logging in. I received the email with the 6 digit security code but when I used the link to use it I wasn’t sent to the page to enter. After multiple try’s I gave up. Monday morning Petflow contacted me about my problem with an apology and a solution. Great customer service. My order shipped quickly and received on time
PetFlow ,customer," May 07, 2023",7 days ago,First-time customer,"First-time customer, I ordered canned cat food because of the good price. Free shipping--good! Timely delivery--good.
However, the packaging was terrible both boxes split open and from one box 3 cans had popped open spilling liquid throughout. Three other cans were so badly dented that I couldn't trust that the product was not tainted. Thus one-fifth of the 32 cans were unusable and had to be discarded. So much for the good price!"
PetFlow ,M. K. MULLENBACH," May 10, 2023",3 days ago,Great value and fast delivery!,I've discovered PetFlow because I searched for the best value I could find for bully sticks for my dogs. I've been really happy with my purchases and will look to them for other pet supplies in the future.

However, it arrived fairly quickly giving the issues. One of the dry food bags had a puncture hole in it. When I spoke to a representative, she did not hesitate in telling me a replacement bag would be sent out. I spoke to her on Saturday. I received an email on Monday that the new bag was being sent. That was good customer service."

PetFlow ,Theresa Patzke Guiver," April 28, 2023","May 15, 2023",One of the best things I love besides…,"One of the best things I love besides the great pet product selection is how PetFlow ships orders. If something heavy is being shipped with something that can easily be crushed, there is a U shaped piece of cardboard inserted in the box to create a protective space for the easily crushed items. Way to go PetFlow. I highly recommend Petflow for the products and care of those products in shipping."

PetFlow ,Daniel Faflik," May 18, 2023","May 19, 2023",Horrible online ordering experience,"I have used pet flow in the past many years ago with success and don’t remember having the same issues I’ve had recently when I started using there company again. A dog food called Rockster which is produced in Europe and only sold via a couple store fronts and petflow where I live forces me to either drive about an hour to the closest store or using petflow.

Since starting back up using petflow I’ve run into many at least 5-6 issues finalizing orders. I’ve set up my profile entered my payment information and updated where needed.

I have had numerous orders canceled on me with 0 notifications being sent to my email on file so by the time 1 week 2 weeks go by I realize I didn’t receive my order.

This then prompts me to go into my petflow account just to realize the order was canceled even though the payment method is GOOD and my personal info all CORRECT.

I have no idea what the problem is now but years ago I don’t remember having a single issue ordering from this company."
PetFlow ,Eduardo," May 09, 2023",5 days ago,My first experience was terrible,"My first experience was terrible. I placed an order on May 8th, and on May 10th it was not even being processed. I cancelled it, placed an order in Chewy.com and got it at the same day.

Umm could have swore I just told you I don't get them even though I get the help replies. Shipped the autoship, didn’t have funds which was why I needed the autoship changed, caused havoc with the bank. Thank goodness I used paypal as I went and cancelled the autopay through them. Still no help getting into account. Im headed back to Chewy where I always get my food, they have great customer service and never have a problem accessing my account. Guess that is what I get for trying to save money."
PetFlow ,NANCY MADIGAN," May 10, 2023",Updated 16 hours ago,I placed an order on May 10th-updates…,"I placed an order on May 10th-updates and tracking with fedex did not occur past the second day and ultimately an agent ordered a replacement order on May 17...on May 24th the shipment was on a truck for delivery but did not arrive...the site still said it would be delivered by end of day ...(they never do deliver to Sahd's after about 3 pm) Your customer service agents generally try to be helpful with the amount of authority they have but do not seem to have any way of influencing fedex . They usually give you (the customer) the same read fedex is showing on the tracking update....Speaking to a supervisor takes ""24-48"" hours and really is unsatisfactory in view of the fact an order has taken two weeks (and two orders!) and still is not delivered. Most companies have more readily available access to a supervisor when needed or they change delivery options for a replacement order....this would certainly improve customer satisfaction ratings, one would think...I have been a customer with your company for a number of years and would like to see you succeed...I really think having a tighter rein on fedex or changing carrier options would solve a lot of issues. Just a note...the lower case fedex is because they aren't dependable.... I know fedex issues/problems have been before you consistently over time - but are you going to do anything about them - to support the customer ? Or continue the status quo...One fresh food pet company I recently spoke with told me they had a number of issues with fedex and no longer have a primary contract with them although they do offer fedex as a carrier if a customer requests it....These are signs a business is serious about customer satisfaction ( and are running with notable standards of operation)...This is an example of just one of many delayed shipment orders I have experienced... I give this experience 2 stars because the agents are really trying to get my order here...the third replacement has been ordered as the second one is in limbo(?)...Sincerely hoping for change...

I did order through PayPal, just to receive one case of food and not two as ordered. I was not notified until I made another query that the warehouse ran out of what I ordered and they have to get it from another. So, if customers don't ask, we are not informed but be left into limbo. Customers like me do no need apologies, what we need is for companies to act proactive and aware of what real marketing is."

You did replace it and for that I was grateful as I understood , hopefully this happened during shipping and not during shipment . Second I had an auto ship that was supposed to go out April 25 , I had time food to be available as I was running out … the shipment status said shipped , however the tracking number continued to show waiting for carrier . If I had not followed up with a call I wouldn’t have received my food , the shipment was resent May 1 … I had to go to Petco and buy dog food to cover gap . My suggestion is tighten up on your shipping process and accountability and internal tracking … you should have notified me of a shipping issue not vice versa . I still use your company and will unless this begins a trend .

PetFlow ,JANET GREY," May 03, 2023","May 15, 2023",everything was simple and fast delivery,"Lured in by low pricing, I ordered a case of a new dog food (canned) to try it out. I ended up converting my dog (over about 10 days) onto this new food. I then ordered 7 more cases with Petflow of the same food I had auditioned and transitioned my dog onto.

What a NIGHTMARE. They put all 7 cases (i.e .84 cans) in ONE BOX. There was a little bubble cushion on one side of the box, but the other 5 sides had no cushion. Guess what? ALL 84 cans were dented -- many of them crushed accordian style and unsafe to use. The majority were deemed unsafe (according to a government can dent guideline I consulted).

Working with Petflow was an exercise in frustration. I called on a Friday and was told that somebody would get back to me tomorrow – – which was Saturday. Nobody ever called me. So late Saturday I called and I was told ""oh no, it takes 24 to 48 hours for somebody to get back to you"". So I waited another 24 hours (IE 48 hours later) still no call. So I call them back on Sunday and say ""where is my return call"". The Petlow representative essentially said oh no what made you think somebody would call you back on the weekend? I was then told I had to wait until Monday, three days later. Meanwhile I had run out of food: the food I had just transitioned my dog onto. My dog has a sensitive stomach and I can't just switch foods on him or he will get severe diarrhea. Now, because of their false promises over the weekend that ""someone"" would call me back, I was totally out!

Finally on Monday a supervisor did call me back. She agreed that there should've been more cushioning in the box and she assured me that they would resend the entire order but instead of sending seven cases in one box they would split it into two boxes and they would include cushioning between the boxes and on the edges of the box.

Well… The replacement shipment arrived today. Indeed, the seven cases were in two boxes split between them. But to my incredible surprise there was zero – – ZERO cushioning in either box. In fact one of the boxes had a very large space of about 3 to 4 inches for the cases to slide back-and-forth inside the box.

What was the condition of these new cans? The 84 replacement cans for the 84 cans that got crushed and dented the first time? Can you guess? These too were crushed and dented. (OMG - I was upset beyond belief going through them. Such a waste of GOOD food... all having to be thrown away -- again.)

Meanwhile, I have spent already about 3 to 4 hours of my life on the phone with PetFlow, documenting the damage in videos, inventorying which cans are severe and which cans are dented but perhaps OK and creating 4 piles based on severity of the dents. I had already thrown out about 65 cans and donated the rest to neighbors who have a higher tolerance for risk than I do. But now… I am facing the same dilemma again because of their incompetence.

For a second time in a week I am finding myself inventorying 84 cans of damaged/crushed dog food cans that are shamelessly dented and ruined so that they can't be enjoyed and put to good use.

As the saying goes fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Shame on me for trusting anyone at PetFlow that they would actually keep their word or that they could actually deliver the $200 plus quantity of dog food in a way that it was not ruined and actually safe and edible.

Honestly, the customer service people are completely siloed away from their warehouse and you are taking your chances if you order any canned food from them. If they tell you they are going to do better next time or they're going to ""include cushioning"" next time… DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.

Run... it's not worth the extra $.50 per can you save. It's absolutely devastating to have to throw out over a hundred cans of dog food that would've been edible if their warehouse staff had half a brain or would take more care."

We've been ordering on a consistent basis since July 2018 (so just shy of 5 years). This final straw has been the last two months when we decided to order all our food for the month in one large order and we have been told we are ""fraudulent"". Then PetFlow tries to blame our credit card getting declined. When I call our bank they say no charges have come through to be declined. This month I have been calling PetFlow every day and dealing with this for 8 days trying to get food for our family. I have spoken with two supervisors, been told I need to wait 24 hours here or 24 hour there but each day I am still ""fraudulent"" for trying to place a large order for my family. All I am doing is instead of ordering small quantities every 5-6 days like I use to, I want to order one large order once a month to make my life easier, but apparently that makes a customer of 5 years a fraud. I'm done. I will take my money and order from a company who makes my life simpler and less insulting."

Whew!
April 6th, 2023
I ordered a few items from chewy and then couldn't find the dog food I always order and found it on this site and ordered it on here. I immediately got a email confirmation from Chewy but not from this site. I was nervous and saw a lot of bad reviews and tried to cancel my order, but could not figure out how to do it. But, I started getting emails, About a half hour after my order, confirming it and then text messages. I received other emails and text messages offering me coupons and special deals. Always keeping me informed. The next morning I got an email and a text message that my order was shipped and the next day my order arrived! I was excited to find this product because chewy does not have it anymore and on Amazon It was double the price. Maybe the bad reviews were for a product that was low stock or maybe the company was just starting out? I'm glad everything worked out. I was nervous at first!

I order things everyday online and have never gotten or heard of getting flagged for fraud. Even when I told customer service about the situation and how my dog now has no food because no one let me know there was a problem with my order, she never offered a discount or help to figure out the situation.

On 3/25/2023, PETFLOW informed me ""due to uncertain times, we're currently delayed on email"" - too busy to fulfill an order?

On 3/27/2023 I called 888-316-7297 to determine what was the delay in the shipment. I was told your FRAUD DEPARTMENT cancelled the order without informing me - why!

Let me remind you, THIS IS NO WAY TO RUN A SUCCESSFUL ORDER-ON-LINE DOG FOOD COMPANY! And needless to say, I will never use your company again!

Shame on you, PETFLOW, and your Fraud Department for neglecting to provide food for senior dogs!

I researched and it appeared that PetFlow is a legitimate company but has several BBB concerns. I called PetFlow initially and was on hold for quite a while, then gave up. Emails persisted. Called again a few days later and spoke to a human who was very nice and deduced that multiple fraudulent accounts had been opened, attached to my email. She reported to cancel them. It’s only been a few days and there are some persistent emails but less so. I think it’s too early to tell whether the problem is resolved. Hopefully it is.

When I asked for Site direction in order to view details the Rep was providing for clarity and assurance, he was unable to do so, 4) I do not even know at this point when or if I will get the PAID FOR Order, now past the initial represented date for delivery and with no Site Record of the transaction. I will pursue the reimbursement protection my Financial Institution offers me in these cases, but it is not worth the trouble to have to go that route for just a few dollars saved on the merchandise and hence becoming too low on supply for my Kitty with Special Needs for comfort.

The issue seems to be primarily with the NJ warehouse where they don't work night, weekends etc. There is a discconnect between product forecasting, order entry and supply chain. these operations are clearly not in sync. There is no back up plan for order surges. In addition, the customer is never notified of shipping delays until the customer calls. Petflow needs to ensure that the product demands are met complete and on time. Their efficieny and on time delivery metrics must be terrible. Nothing seems to be done about it."

I have complained on multiple occasions that my shipment of canned dog food arrives damaged. They pack too many flats of cans in the same box, and don't use any packing materials to prevent against damage. I have brought this to their attention each time, but nothing is ever done about it. Most recently, they packed 4 cases of cans- 48 cans!- in the same package. It arrived with dented cans and the box was totally opened. It was way too heavy for a senior citizen to lift without injury. On each occasion, PetFlow has made an accommodation for me, either a discount or a new shipment, which is very much appreciated. However, I would prefer that they ship it properly the first time. One time, the cans sent as a replacement were also dented.

As a result we had just enough food to mix/switch to another brand that was available in our area. In our opinion the Auto-Ship customers should have taken precedence and shipped on time and as scheduled because this order was in their system for many weeks.

My last order was a total nightmare dealing with your customer service reps. Rude, condescending, passive aggressive e-mails sent to me when all I asked was ""where's my dog food"". I ordered on Dec 31st fully aware that there would be a delay in shipping due to the Jan. 1st holiday. 12 days later still no dog food. First I was given every excuse short of climate change. Then I was just about accused of being a Christmas Grinch for expecting PetFlow employees to work through the holidays-Again I ordered on the 31st way past Christmas and expected a delay. By the 10th of Jan I had given up hope of receiving my dog food so I requested a refund. With that request I received another nasty e-mail with a link to print up a mailing label to send the dog food back before I could receive a refund. I live in a rural town where the nearest Fed EX is 60 miles away so 120 miles round trip to return a bag of dog food that I still never received! Petflow did offer me a $15 credit towards my next order to which I told them to donate it to feed homeless pets. Well your customer reps did not like that response. I finally did get my refund from Omnipet and then received the dog food following day. With that I received one last e-mail from a rep telling me my dog food arrived which it had and then telling me to take that bag of dog food and donate it it to a shelter! Wow just wow..I never expected something for nothing, again a final insult from a customer service rep.

The bag of food didn’t even come delivered in a box. I couldn’t believe they delivered of bag of opened dog food. At that point, I canceled my membership and went to my local pet store to pick up my monthly bag of food. After about 7 months, my Father In Law convinced me to give them another chance since I was saving $5 an order with PetFlow. Again, my first order was delivered on time with no issues. My second order was delayed by two weeks of my original delivery date. I contacted customer service multiple times and the only thing they could say was would you like to cancel your order. No apology or anything. I bought a smaller bag of food while I was waiting for my 30 pound bag of food and of course, my shipment was delayed further where I had to go back to my pet store to buy a 30 pound bag of food because I ran out of food again. I received a $5 coupon for inconvenience but in the end I spent $90 within two weeks because of my order constantly being delayed with no actual answer for expected delivery time.

I think you could probably find what you would get at any other pet-retailer, comparable prices, the website was easy enough to navigate and there were discount codes available.
Cons: the autoship that I set up did not get shipped until about 6 days after the chosen date. The packaging is not as environmentally friendly as I had hoped - lots of plastic “air pockets” that really can’t be recycled. Customer service interactions were odd. I sent an email asking when my shipment would be sent out and the auto-reply started with the line “During these difficult times…”. Difficult times for the company? For humanity? For me? It was just bizarre and I’m surprised that whoever came up with that got it approved. A few days later I received an email from an actual agent asking for my order number because they couldn’t find the info. How can you not find my info? What type of record-keeping system are you using that you can’t look up a client and see all of their purchases and the statuses?
Overall, the cons feel like growing pains. I work for a startup and I understand how those earlier days can be. I’ll continue purchasing from them. At the end of the day, I was able to purchase what I wanted at a discounted price and the items arrived in a reasonable time frame. So, overall a decent first impression."

PetFlow ,Jasmine Williams," November 07, 2022","Nov 8, 2022",Website Lists Items They Don't Have,"Main complaint - Damaged cans over and over again.

I have been told to call and requests additional packing, additional boxes, email notifications on auto ship status. I do all these things and still petflow comes up short.

If something is out of stock at the time of shipping not at the time of ordering. Zero communication even though petflow has charged your card.

Repeated damaged shipments regardless of my continuous phone calls to them requesting split shipments and additional packing as they themselves told me to do. Every time I call it is a different excuse.

I've had credits applied to my account and assured they will be applied to my next order. NO, I have to call and make sure they do it. Sometimes they can't find it, have to hunt for it, and blame someone else that works there for the error.

After repeatedly calling in and telling them about dented cans arriving here, and the external boxes showing no damage, calling in prior to shipping and requesting two boxes and additional packaging (as they told me to do) still damage. They don't listen and have a book full of excuses.

The last order just two days ago and the previous order had many dented cans and many orders before. Some actually crushed top to bottom. Not the manufacturers fault I checked. So who FedEx? I really don't care who's to blame. I want quality product delivered to my door step and proper treatment. You could learn a thing or two from Amazon.

This last order had 17 dented cans out of 48. That's bad.

Correct the problem both in your shipping department and your customer service department before you lose business."

This time around, I received a package BEFORE I received the shipping notification. Upon receiving my partial order (because one item was on backorder) there was 1 item missing (other than the backordered item). I was charge for all items, but only 2 of the 3 other items were in the package. I called and spoke to someone, they also thought it was very strange to receive the items before the notification and that one of the items was missing. After this conversation, i received the shipping notification for this shipment which did indicate that the missing item was supposed to be included. After about 2 days, i still hadn't received a communication or shipping info on the missing item. I then received a shipping notification for the backordered item, ,but still nothing on the missing item. Not even confirmation of our conversation... nothing to indicate that the missing item was being taken care of. I then emailed you again to ask about it, at that time the shipping notification had come in showing that the missing item had shipped and then a reply to the email to say the same. While there was no real tragedy here... there was a lot of unnecessary stress all due to not being more communicative. The rep had told me that the warehouse failed to input the shipping info which is why the notification wasn't triggered. What ever it was, it was unusual to say the least."

The card company was just as dumb-founded as I was. they told me there wasnt anything wrong with my card, my credit or anything. She couldnt figure out why they even said that.

They didn't even have the courtesy to tell me the order was canceled and I had to dispute the payment with my credit card company. And what fraud crime ring is running dog food scams?

You do not let customers know that an item is out of stock until they contact you. You just leave them hanging and wondering.

You also take too long to deliver your products. This is not acceptable. When you pet has special dietary needs and you cannot supply the food they need, it is very frustrating and we don't know what to do to be able to feed our precious pet.

The one area that needs to be addressed is the contradicting information the site provides during the prescription food order process. The site noted that food (non-medicine) prescriptions can be emailed to s specific inbox. However, once the order was submitted, the confirmation email noted that the hard copy prescription must be physically mailed to the pharmacy before the order is fully processed. This was confirmed by the support representative when I called. Therefore, scripts for prescription food or for medication must be physically mailed.

Luckily, I had asked my vet for a prescription in June, so I had an original to mail. I don’t like to mail this, because I have to get a new one anytime I find a better price somewhere else. I mailed it the very next day, and I immediately start getting emails telling me to mail the prescription. It had only been one day. So, after about 3 days, I get an email telling me that I could email a copy if I preferred. YES, I PREFERRED to go that at the time of ordering, but I was NOT given that option. Do I called to complain, and I asked for my original prescription back. I was told that they could not get the script back. I then asked to just cancel the order and was told that I could order that either. Then, about a week later, I get an order…….NOT my order…….someone else’s order. I called the customer service number and got a young man. When I tried to explain that the box had my name/address, but the box contained someone else’s order/receipt, he got belligerent and acted like I was nuts. He hung up on me.

A couple days later, on Saturday, a week after placing my order, I called the Petflow to check why my order wasn’t shipped and they told me that they cancelled my order due to stocking issues. Really? Why do you accept orders if you don’t have food in the stock? Why does it have to take a week to figure out that you don’t have food in the stock??

In this case I have a backup plan for my cat's new medical needs (this is a new diet after hospital admission), and so I'm not left hanging. Cat will be fine.

I’ve had no issues buying cases of the food from PetFlow. As a matter of fact, I decided to put it on auto ship because I know I can rely on getting what I need at basically the same price but delivered to my door. Thanks!"

It was in stock when I ordered it and I thought with my request once it was approved, I would get a case, believing a case was held for my order. I made 3 or 4 phones call to PetFlow regarding status and after receiving an email to have my vet approve their request, I call to let them know my vet would be approving shortly. The person said they would let the pharmacy know, but he never asked me for the order number, my name or any of my order information. The last call I made, PetFlow said it would ship that day or by Monday. The next day I saw the order was rejected and I called again. Apparently, it became out of stock right before my vet approved the prescription."

Items shipped from two warehouses which is okay, but took an extra few days for shipping. Didn't ship immediately. The first shipment they shorted me a bag of food. So since the chat feature wasn't working, e-mail stated they are behind on answering, so I called them. I was told the ""missing"" bag would arrive on Monday. This didn't sound right to me since it showed it had been shipped with the order. And I knew I was going to get the remaining part of my order by Wednesday. This was on a Friday. I then e-mailed for confirmation the missing bag would be here on Monday as stated. Instead the next representative who responded by e-mail let me know they had put in a replacement to ship the missing bag. So the shorted bag was simply a packing error, and instead of telling me they had messed up, they were stringing me along. Because the second rep. put the order in, I did finally receive the bag I had been shorted. Also, always check the fresh by dates. One item I received has a use by date of 8/22 which is only a month out. Luckily it is a treat, and I will be using it this coming week. So overall, not too thrilled with how they ship, some of their customer service, but the prices are goods. I will probably order from again, but I know to stay vigilant on when it's being shipped, once it's arrived to check it, then to verify the use by dates."

PetFlow never did fill the script so we're left without option except to just take the script to Petsmart to fill instead, as we can't just accept that PetsFlow won't fill it and therefore our cat has to go without the necessary diet after the ultrasound showed his sediments in his bladder/kidney.

The food doesn't flow as well as I'd like but all gravity feeders work about the same. The water spout could be lower. There's quite a bit of water left. The container must be tilted to use all the water. Simple fix would be to raise one side a little. Filling the water is a breeze; fill from the drinking cup. Laying it flat on the sink edge makes it super easy. My dogs took to it quickly. I placed it on a square furniture mover that has carpet and four wheels. Just the right height and it rolls. It's heavy when full. If the dogs move it, I know it's low on water and/or food. Overall, I'm happy with it. It's worth it for the footprint alone."

Did not receive the email so I called again, spoke to someone else and they said the order was canceled. When I asked why he said that I should have gotten an email explaining it to me. I repeated what the lady had told me yesterday and all he could say was I'm not sure why but you need to check your email. The email indicated the order was canceled because the item was not in stock from manufacturer. My feedback is this: First, don't say that an item is in stock when it clearly isn't. The site has tons of items that show in stock vs not. Second, it seems like the customer service people (both whom I talked to) have no idea what's going on, if one said everything is good and is shipping and the other couldn't tell me the order status/why it was canceled so I needed to reference my email.

I contacted the manufacturer of the food who confirmed there was no inventory. I contacted PetFlow to cancel the order since I knew there was no way it was going to be fulfilled and they said they could not.

When I finally got the shipping confirmation, I realized there had been a bait and switch and it was a different variety of the food (one we’d tried and hadn’t agreed w our dogs). I ended up with two bags of very expensive prescription dog food that I can’t feed our dogs. PetFlow will not allow a return since it was prescription.

I hadn’t ever been on your website or heard of the company. But my 4 year old fell in love with a puppy from a girl I know in Utah. After adopting the puppy we asked what food she was already on so we didn’t feed her something different and upset her tummy, she was only 5 lbs at 9 weeks, she was the runt. After searching all my local stores in Florida I couldn’t find the brand, so when I googled it, your website popped up. Before ordering my husband called the customer service number because we didn’t know if the food would get here in time and if not, we would order from another website that had cheaper pricing and free faster shipping. The representative assured us that the Florida warehouse had it in stock so it would actually come earlier than needed. I ordered a bag of the food and a chew toy. 2 days later I received an email that the toy was not coming, out of stock. After 3 days passed I called the number and I was told it was coming from New Jersey and hadn’t even shipped from that warehouse yet. So I was in a panic because I didn’t want to make this puppy sick and give her new food. The girl I spoke with didn’t even apologize for the misinformation or offer to speed up the shipping or anything. Luckily I was able to pay the breeder money to overnight me some food from her bag up in Utah. If I didn’t need to keep her on this food until we see the vet Friday to ask if I can switch her I would have sent this back. I will not be ordering from your site again. Very disappointed with the lack of customer service."

My elderly dogs were on wet dog food and they liked it till I took them to my friends house. She had the beef Fromm out for her dogs. My dogs decided they like that food better than theirs. It was a month of trying to get them to eat their food, I asked my vet what he thought of Fromm and he said he thought it was a good food. One of the reasons I went to wet food is 2 of them only has 4 teeth in the back and 4 in the front figuring they could not eat hard dog food again but they can and love it. Small bites."

If they are pretending items are in stock, but they really are out - that is misleading.

I called my vet and they said they had not received anything. And then call you guys back to let you know please send the authorization again because they have not received it. A week goes by and still nothing. By text and call, I am told they are unsure of what the problem is ( you have the RX and show the product in stock) and assure me that our dog food will be shipped out very shortly. This happens again so I cancel the order. I receive a voicemail another week later telling me they have found the problem, apologizing and offering me a 20% off. I called and ask many questions, like is the product in stock, do you already have my prescription, all of which the answer was yes. So I decide to re-order. Once again I am assured that my item will ship within two days and I Would get a email confirmation with shipping info. When three days go by and I have not gotten an email, I check on the order. I see that it says waiting on that approval… I of course call to find out why since I was told you have already received the prescription. And once again the person was not sure.

I really do think PetFlow is an awesome place to get a decent value on pet food but I don't like the forced atmosphere for checkout.

The prices are similar to the site I usually use. Some of the items were slightly cheaper some more expensive.
One huge con was that I spent an hour filling my basket got a phone call and when I came back the cart was empty. I called which took a bit of a wait to speak to someone to be told I had to start again. Bit frustrating.
The shipping was bit slower than what I was expecting too the other site is within 24-48 hours here it took close to a week and when it did arrive some of the order was missing. I called and the item was replaced and shipped within 3-4 days.
Overall the prices are good. customer service is slow to answer but good once you get them on the line, shipping is slow but if you are not in a rush its ok. The overall selection of items for what I usually buy was also low. Only half of what I wanted was actually listed.
I probably will shop here again but not if I need the items quickly."

Then I got an email that Pet Flow could not contact the vet. This was the first trouble.
I called my vet and told them the situation. The vet was so nice that they called the number in the email, but she was told THERE WASN'T MY ORDER UNDER MY ORDER NUMBER. She tried twice, but the same result. Second trouble.
I talked to the customer service twice, and explained what was happening, and she said she would get back to us on that day. I didn't get an email on that day but I got it on the next day. The email said, Pet Flow could not find the paient/vet relationship with the vet even though my vet tried to talk and authorize TWICE. Then my order was canceled in the end.

Excellent!
So I immediately purchased more food, one that I know would be ok for my cat.

The replacement got cancelled as they were out of stock. I had to call again to get the refund, the system didn't know it was a replacement.

A week later their site says In Stock, so I try ordering more vet prescription cat food. A week later, the order is canceled due to out of stock, but their website still says In Stock.

Two weeks later the site still says In Stock. Since I can't find this critical food anywhere, I desperately try again, but get the same results.

I called Customer Service to let them know the issue. Every Customer Service person I've spoken with has been lovely, hence the 3 stars. The CS rep said they know about the website but since another company sends out vet food they don't always know when they are out of stock. However, every other online pet store are able to update their site with this key information. It's stressful enough trying to find my sick cat's food, but to put in orders based on them saying ""in stock"" only to have them rejected in a week is infuriating. Please fix it."

The next week I received part of my order. Today, two weeks after I made the order, I texted to see when the other half of my order would be arriving. I was told that it had been canceled and would be refunded.

I have a cat suffering from sores and scabs over his body so I would have liked to be notified that the food wasn’t coming. Now everything is out of stock and I have to wait for my vet to be in the office to prescribe another food if there is one.

The only reason I didn’t give this fewer stars is because the person texting me got back to me quickly each time I texted with questions regarding the status of my order so that is a good feature."

The most frustrating part about this time was that when I called customer service they said they were going to send me a box out immediately and I then got an email notification saying they had run out so I would be given a refund. The first time this happened I chalked it up as a processing mistake, second time plus other shipping issues I’ve had made me realize there are definitely some order processing problems at the warehouses? It’s very frustrating because I like the prices in the speed in which orders are handled, but seems to be a lot of mistakes made with orders that shouldn’t happen. I doubt there are a lot of people that would pay $90 for one buffalo toothpick treat, but you would think that might catch someone’s eye when they’re filling the order?

I placed my order, immediately emailed the prescription, and almost a week late they still had not even sent me an email with any updates. I reached out to them twice, and while their chat reps are very nice, they provided no help. I tried to cancel the order, again after NO notification that the order had been processed, the rep told me she would send the request to cancel but that the foods were processed by another company. THREE days later they shipped the order. You can’t tell me they can’t cancel an order 3 days before it’s processed.
I only used Petflow because there was a nationwide shortage of my pet’s food… but in the time they took to process my order, my primary provider of the food was able to get it back in stock, and I was able to place and receive the order before Petflow even processed the order.
Horrible experience all around."

PetFlow ,LEO VIDES," March 18, 2022","Mar 18, 2022",MISLEADING advertisement,Shipping takes too long. But I can deal with that. What is unacceptable is when you have items listed “in stock” when you really don’t. Specially when it comes to items that need a veterinarian prescription. I DON’T CARE how big of a company you are. That’s why they have computers and programs that can take care of those logistics. If an item sells out. Which happens. It shouldn’t take more than a week to hear back. And only took a week because I WAS the one who called. NO ONE reached out me. I’m NEVER ordering from you guy’s again. I’ll stick to Chewy..

PetFlow ,Prefer to remain anonymous," March 16, 2022","Mar 17, 2022",Pet flow is guilty of false advertising,"In my last order for dog food to PetFlow the order was first just later than expected. When I called up customer service, I was told that orders were piling up at PetFlow, but that the order would be given an ""expedited"" designation by the customer service person. The day after that conversation, I discovered that my PayPal charge for the food was refunded. When I again talked with the same customer rep, I was told that a mistake had occurred and that I would still be getting the food in spite of the refund,

That all happened about two weeks ago (today is 3/16/2022). No food has been delivered to me from PetFlow.

So this was, from my perspective, a completely botched order. I subsequently ordered the food from a different supplier and got the bag of kibble two days after I placed that new order.

Even though I had ordered food successfully from PetFlow in the past I will never, ever deal with PetFlow again. I depend on a supplier for sending me the dog food my pet needs in a timely fashion. My experience with PetFlow indicates that they are, at best, unreliable."

PetFlow ,LARA ZINTSMASTER," March 03, 2022","Mar 4, 2022",Prompt when shipping items in stock,"Prompt when shipping items in stock. Not so prompt in communicating when items are back ordered. And the website shows them still in stock. I placed an order my vet approved February 15. I checked on it February 22 and was advised the WET food was cancelled because my vet turned it down, but that the dry food would be shipping soon. My vet had approved the whole order as I had called them before checking my order so that was incorrect information off the bat.

I then received a notice that my WET food was shipping but the DRY food was cancelled off my order on 3/1 because it was out of stock. 3/3, nearly 2 weeks after the order was approved my in stock wet food is only now shipping from New Jersey. Why didn’t it ship back on the 15th, or even the 22nd when I inquired and why was I provided incorrect info?

Nearly two weeks when you advise to allow 1-3 days from approval to ship is not acceptable. Over a week to advise me an item is out of stock is also unacceptable and your website still indicates it’s in stock, which is even more frustrating because I will now pay shipping on each item individually when I had actually ordered together to save on shipping. And I don’t have confidence you even have it in stock. Also why cancel an order as opposed to let it sit in backorder if it will replenish this fast? So… usually a happy customer hence the 3 stars instead of lower."

It was already shipped, so I ask can I return it , they said yes and sent me the shipping label. Then said I would get a refund minus the shipping. There would not have been a shipping fee at all if they had the product that I ordered, so I should not be charged a shipping fee at all since none of this was my fault.

My usual supplier (they advertise on TV a LOT) emailed me 24 hours before my scheduled shipment of the food telling me it was out of stock and my order was canceled! Like, tough luck for you and your kitty. The other pet suppliers who advertise on cable were out of stock as well. I searched online to find another source, and happily found PetFlow. Once they confirmed the prescription with my vet, the order was shipped, and I had it in 2 days -- well-packed and exactly what I ordered.

The price from pet flow was among the lowest I could find if not the exact same as competitors. The ordering process was easy and smooth. They had to contact the vet before fulfilling the order. I believe it was shipped out within 3-4 days of me placing the order. If I'm remembering correctly I received the food within 7 days of ordering. Not sure but it seemed very reasonable. Everything went well and I will continue to order from Pet Flow in the future.

UPDATE: I was triple charged for a prescription food order. Suppose to be $50 was charged for 3 orders so $150. Also they don't allow you to take your card off and stop autoship without a customer service agent doing it. They take the order then when its time to ship they say its out of stock.

What a difficult experience...

Called again on the 30th, was told that the Rx was verified, so package would be shipped and I would get it by February 2nd. When there still was neither package or a tracking number, called the customer service again for the 3d time, was told that no shipping info was available, so I asked to talk to the supervisor and was told that he'd call me within 24-48 hrs. Needless to say, no one called me or reached out to me via email.
I had no choice but cancel my purchase on February 4th and order the food on a more reliable site. Just hope the money would be promptly returned.

I need things to be correct the first time i place an order which is why i probably wont use this company again unless they have a really great deal going on.. also, they sent me an unsolicited annoying email asking for this rating.

I contacted Petfllow multiple times to cancel the two out of stock products. One cancelled correctly, but the other already shipped so I received a $20 off inconvenience discount on it. Then after all that, two of the same product was shipped and I was charged for the second of that same product. Appreciated the inconvenience discount, but then to receive two of the same product and charged I was very annoyed. The product was a case of wet canned dog food, which I purchased elsewhere because they originally told me it would be cancelled. On top of that ai now gave 3 cases for my dog that may pass before one case is used up. I told them I only wanted the one case after they had said it shipped because my dog is old and may not live.

Too bad government leaders don’t consider pet supplies as crucial for some. Backlog of undelivered products and delayed shipping is avoidable and flat wrong. It becomes the Hunger Games for our pets.

Even then the first notice I received said I would receive the delivery one the 26th. I received the puppy on the 25th. The breeder was kind enough to send some food to get the puppy through for a couple of days. I ran out of food Saturday morning, long after I should have received the food. I ended up buying a bag of dog food. Not the kinds the breeder had been using. I didn't not receive the food from petflow until January 31st.

Bottom line is I did not receive my order until the 23rd. As this was coming from the East coast I acknowledge part of the delay was the storm that occurred."

I believed this because my vet is very organized and always approves appropriate prescriptions in less than 24 hours. On the fourth phone call I was told the authorization had NOT come through.

These larger cans spoil before I can finish them as I have a small dog. I contacted the company, requesting an exchange but was told I could return the larger cans for an account credit, however, they could not tell me when the smaller cans would be back in stock. I believe I should have been offered a refund rather than a credit.

Seemed they ran out of my dog's food at the nearest Wearhouse and had to send it to me from Las Vegas. They had sent me an email, but our power had gone out so by the time I called I hadn't revived it yet. We did get the dog food a couple of days late but that was because of a major snowstorm moving up the East Coast. I love Pet Flow as there send time is normally 2 or 3 days at most. I can't get upset with them over running out at one warehouse and a snowstorm. It seems like they do more than humanely possible as fast as they get there items out.

Everything went fine for a year and a half. Our dog needs a prescription diet. Then for the last shipment, they said the order was submitted. Then a few days later, I got a email saying they were out of the product. They had a pending charge on my credit card for more than a week for over $100.00.
I called and the girl basically said oh well sorry, that's the way it goes.

At this point we were close to being out of food. Our vet didn't have any. So I got some OTC food to mix with what we had left.

Finally, I went to Chewy and they sent some within a few days.

I can understand that in this day and age, that they ran out of the food, but their service was very mundane.

PetFlow ,mary comer," January 16, 2022","Jan 16, 2022",Check your bank balances people,Check your bank balances people! If you’re on AutoShip even if you’re not. Check your bank balances. The food is great. My dog loves the food. No problems there. I bought 2 44 lb bags of this dog food for the first time on November 8 for $148.40. So then a week later on December 1 they had a 25% off sale. So I bought another two bags and ask them to put it on my AutoShip to be sent out January 10. So I’m going over my bank balances this morning and I noticed that they charged me the original $148.40 for 2 44 lb bags on November 8. Then I was charged $127.73 on December 1. My guess is that the bag I bought on sale on December 1.( The one I told them to put on the AutoShip.) Then again on December 3 I was charged another $127.73. Then on January 6 I was charged another $148.80. Then January 13 I was charged $159.66. I only received the original two that I bought on November 8 and I just received another two bags that I bought on sale that was in the auto ship. So they charged me an extra $450 for I have no idea what. So I called them to see why there charging me for dog food that I never authorized them to. I got a recording that said somebody will be with you immediately. I waited 20 minutes listening to stupid clown music. Then I got a recording saying please leave a message. I only made two legitimate purchases from them. So I’m just saying beware and check your bank accounts. Looks like they are looking for people who don’t check your bank balances and charging them extra hoping they won’t notice.

PetFlow ,al," January 16, 2022","Jan 16, 2022",Overall I love PetFlow,"Overall I love PetFlow, but in this particular case where my auto-ship was delayed due to out-of-stock conditions I feel I was not notified sufficiently quickly enough to react. As a result, the Hills Prescription cat food I had ran out and I needed to switch my girls temporarily to another food--not something I wanted to do.

Further, once I contact PetFlow to discuss this (and explaining this prescription food is somewhat important to their well being) I felt it still took a bit longer than it should have to receive the work-around order (two smaller bags of the same food). Oh, and perhaps when the original auto-ship encountered the out-of-stock condition it would have been better for PetFlow to offer the alternative bag size so I could receive the food on time?

All that said, I might be expecting too much from PetFlow as the bar has been set really high. You guys are really great, so take the above more as a suggestion rather than a criticism.

They also have a limited selection of foods for dogs and birds, but what they do have, is decently priced and a bit lower than other sites.

Was told it would ship Friday and maybe FedEx would deliver Saturday, but I would have it Monday. It's shipping from NJ to KY...not too far so this seemed likely.

Guess what???....my order STILL isnt here and my dogs are out of food because I couldn't rely on this company. PetFlow advertises order will typically be received in 2 business days. Not even close, so I've had to buy dogfood they've never eaten before from Walmart to get them by. Not happy about this because this disrupts their diet. My order wasn't even picked up by FedEx until Monday night because the label wasn't even created until Monday! Tracking says it won't get here until Thursday the 13th. That's a week later! This horribly slow system doesn't cut it."

PetFlow ,SUSAN S," December 23, 2021","Dec 23, 2021",Disappointed,"I purchased some hard to find puppy food because no stores in my area carry it. I found it in stock with PetFlow. I ordered it and they use FedEx as their shipping carrier. I have had numerous problems with getting my packages late via FedEx. I emailed PetFlow to give them some feedback about FedEx. I have not heard back from them. I am not faulting them for FedEx’s slowness, I only reached out to them so they would be aware that some customers experience slow shipping times with FedEx. Unfortunately I will not continue to order from websites that ship via FedEx. I will transition my dog to a food I can readily purchase in stores."

PetFlow ,freneticminde," December 22, 2021","Dec 22, 2021",Love PetFlow!,"I made an order from Petflow awhile back. Never received the order. When I checked the order, it had been canceled due to an error by the Veterinarian. Unfortunately, no one told me it was cancelled. I called the Veterinarian and their internal communications got confused and that is why they cancelled. So I called Petflow back, with the Veterinarians office on the other phone. They assured me they could get the order/reordered. And the Veterinarians office was signing the original Rx while all 3 of us were on the line. I let Petflow know that I needed this food ASAP, and I would pay whatever I needed to pay to get the order expedited. They assured me this would be done. The order was done on 12/17/2021. And as I said, with the Petflow employee and the Veterinarian that could hear each other. Here is is almost 5 days later and this order has not been filled and sent. I was not notified of the first cancellation, and not sure if this order was ever set up for an expedited delivery. I am hoping that someone will get back to me on this, as I am currently having to purchase a can at a time from the Veterinarian.
Thank you for your time with this matter.

It was a few days later than usual but that was to be expected at Christmas time. The problem was that a bottle of white dog. shampoo had opened up inside the box and covered a 15 pound bag of dog food and a raincoat with a whole bottle of blue shampoo. It was everywhere, slippery sticky and blue. I managed to get it off the bag and finally the raincoat. The shampoo bottle was essentially empty and the inside of the box was a big blue mess. I realize that these things happen. Perhaps having a plastic bag that zip locks closed instead of just an open plastic bag that the product can fall out of would be a good idea . Still out of shampoo."

PetFlow ,WK," November 10, 2021","Nov 11, 2021",Bait and Disappoint,"On Oct 29th after not being able to obtain the prescription canned dog food needed through normal online pet care provider for over 60 days, I found the PetFlow website which showed the food was ""in stock"". To be sure I called the same day & spoke to an Agent who confirmed their database did indicate the food was In stock. Consequently I placed an order that day and sent the Agent I'd spoken to the original (in-force) prescription. She confirmed via email she'd forward it to the appropriate area to expedite the order as we were running out of food. Received order confirmation that day; along with email form Agent saying she'd forwarded the prescription to complete the order.

After receiving no further information I contacted PetFlow via the text message system and was informed "" Hi there! It looks like we are still awaiting approval on this order. I've sent your prescription to our pharmacy team again and asked that they approve this order today. Once shipped, you'll be notified via email!"" And, that "" I just followed up with our pharmacy team"". Still having received no information I called the Customer Service Number on Nov 4th. Rep advised she'd look into it and give me a call back. The call never came.

Then, on Nov. 9th at 11:38AM I received an email which stated "" As you know, we've been monitoring the status of your order and anticipating a new shipment from the manufacturer. Regrettably, we still have not received raw product(s)."" ""As a result, we've had to cancel your order"".

Consequently one can only assume after showing the item ""in-stock"" on the PetFlow website and after calling to confirm that before placing the order and then having received nothing prior to the Nov. 9th notice that PetFlow ""Never"" had the item in-stock. The old Bait and Switch.

Therefore, after this experience I can not and will not recommend PetFlow to anyone."

They also send nondescript emails if one of the prescription diets are on backorder and won't be shipped so we never quite know if our monthly order will come until we are almost out of food. The other issue is they don't automatically ship when the backorder diet is back in stock, they wait till the next scheduled autoship order date unless you call to find out when the food will be shipped.

PetFlow ,PATRICIA CAMPBELL," October 21, 2021","Oct 21, 2021","Good job, PetFlow!","Love the products and ease of ordering. My problem is with the actual shipping/packaging of items being sent to my house. Often EVERYTHING (no matter what size or weight) is thrown into the same weakly sealed (one strip of packing tape), thin cardboard box. By the time it arrives at my house, the box is falling apart or in pieces. Further, the products inside are smashed or in some cases have holes in the bags. I have received many bags (over the years) of 28lb cat litter with rips or holes I've had to patch. My last order of 2 (28lb) bags of cat litter and 2 (5lb) bags of cat food were all in ONE weakly sealed, cheap cardboard box. The box was falling apart, so I couldn't even move it (not to mention it weighed 66 lbs!). I tried to wrestle it, but nothing would stay inside. Finally, I had to remove each product one by one and carry them from my front porch to my basement. One bag of litter had a rip in it, so I had to tape it shut (Again!! This is like the 3rd or 4th time this has happened.). I now know I cannot bring your delivered boxes into my house, as it more than likely has litter spilling out inside. The other smaller, miscellaneous products (cat treats, pumpkin puree, etc.) were smashed from the weight of the heavier items and/or in the case of the pumpkin, its box was falling apart, too. I wish more care was taken with the actual shipment of the products. I'm tired of repairing rips, removing loose cat litter from all the other products (and my house) and dealing with ripped shipping boxes. Maybe shipping the heavier items in their own, individual box would be a good idea. I keep ordering from you because I do like the products and they are basically usable. It would just be nice to not have to wrestle with the shipping packages every time."

With all the shortages and difficulties getting our cats Hill’s Science Diet, and with the price gouging at competitor sites, it was certainly gratifying to find what I was looking for at Petflow. Our cats are finicky and spoiled and they love their Hills. The pandemic has been hard on them too! Finding the food we were looking for at Petflow made our household very happy!"

It really felt like a bait and switch after it happened 3 times. Really bad business practices."

PetFlow ,D. PROF.," October 04, 2021","Oct 5, 2021",Ordered Rx cat/case cans/Blue W+U on…,"Ordered Rx cat/case cans/Blue W+U on 9/21/21. Vet contacted on 9/22, responded same day. ON 9/30 still no confirmation that order had shipped.

9/22 - Had made calls early-on to check to see if everything had been approved, processed and had specifically asked WHEN PLACING the order ""having any issues with inventory or getting the diets?"" their answer was ""no, not at all.""

9/24 - You can not be connected to any type of Supervisor; ""we don't have the ability to transfer a call, we can email them and they will call you.""
When might that be? ""Sometimes the same day most likely the next day, would you like me to send that request?"" Yes - spoke with a Supervisor on the 30th, cancelled my order.

In between those times I had spoken with CSR's , they were nice and tried to be helpful but, gave conflicting information. I was told on 2 occasions everything was fine and (the Customer Service Rep(s)) didn't know why things weren't moving along but assured me 'it should be any time', another said he would 'look into it' and call or email me back - nope - On another call I was told there was (now) difficulty from the manufacturer's with their ability to make and ship the product.
Sadly, the first (taught) rule of thumb is to shift or pass the responsibility/blame of an issue onto something or someone else, especially if you don't have an adequate answer or explanation and it is or was (most likely), your mistake.

I'm pretty sure Blue didn't call PetFlow just that very day and say 'oop's no shipments'. Also, no capabilities for transfer to a Supervisor? These days...com'on

On the 30th I did have Amy pick up my call, she recognized my # (or name) and identified herself as the Supervisor that was supposed to have called me. She explained she tried to call and ""my phone number would not let her go through"". Okay...I'm not really sure what that means, but...:o}
I asked her about the production issues with Blue, she told me there weren't any, I gave her the information I was given and she said ""no, no problems that she'd been informed of or aware of"", that's when I decided it'd be easier to just cancel the order.

After I hung-up I called a company on the West coast. A family owned business and excellent communicators. Their annex that their Rx food orders go to are also closed on Sat. & Sun., JUST LIKE PetFlows.

I ordered on 9/30, approved 10/1, shipped today 10/4 - now that's how to do it! Will receive by 10/6 - 7. BEA - U - TI - FUL!"

When I called customer service to clarify, the rep did a search of warehouse inventory and at first found the product was out of stock and it was unknown when it would be available. Ten minutes later, he called back to tell me he had found half of the amount I needed and had it shipped right away. Great service!"
PetFlow ,Bryan Kortis," October 03, 2021","Oct 4, 2021",Great customer service!,Products are good. Just shipping a heavy bag of aquarium gravel with a plastic container of cat food in the same package is asking for disaster.

I ordered 2 cases and had my Vet send a prescription to your company. After not receiving my food after 10 days I called your customer service dept. who told be you do not stock this food and it gets shipped from the manufacturer. The manufacturer has not had the food in stock since July. Why would you advertise the product knowing very well you could not supply it. I feel your company can't be trusted and advertises a product that is out of stock.
