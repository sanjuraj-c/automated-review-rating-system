0,4.0,its been a great entry point for our family into echo we are learning how to use it but the entire family has had fun trying it out
1,3.0,it is great to be able to connect to my larger echo and having the alexa functionality is awesome the volume is not very loud and playback could be a lot clearer if i were to do it all over again i would purchase another full size echo not the echo dot
2,5.0,there is nothing to complain about this product
3,1.0,i bought two of the gb sandisk ultra microsdhc cards and both of them were unusablethe first one stopped accepting new data when i had put a bit less than one gig of data onto the card i couldnt add more files and i couldnt reformat the card if i tried to write a new file onto the card the write operation seemed as if it worked but the new data couldnt be read back successfully the files already on the card were still readable though so basically the card had become a gb rom fortunately there was no sensitive personal information on the card so i returned it to amazonthe second one didnt fail the same way but it was still unusable if i transferred a bunch of files and then read them back most of the transferred files had data errors for example a minute music file might only be able to have its first minute of music played back then the bad data would stop the music player i ran a writereadback test and confirmed that there were data errors on nearly every block tested i used flashdrivetestervexe which is a free downloadi ended up buying the equivalent transcend producttranscend information tsgusdc gb micro sdhc flash memory no box or adapterwhich has been performing flawlessly i have over half of the capacity in use and ive never seen any sign of data loss or corruption for usb plug in flash drives ive had good luck with sandisk products but my experience with the sandisk microsdhc cards has been terrible
4,2.0,terrible sound quality i dont have much idea about songs from the edm pop genre but if you are one whos into rockmetal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible the sound clarity is terribly lows can be lived with the mids would make you hate your decision to buy the highs would make you kill yourself noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery build quality is good however its only been a week in terms of comfort never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous hours once buds are soft and fit in snugly bluetooth connectivity is strong however there are times when the connection stutters and yes it cannot be refundedonly replaced so purchase wisely
5,3.0,maybe i wouldve kept this top i love the print colors and design however i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it since my bust and torso seemed too large for it the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good
6,2.0,though sound quality is good fm radio is not working i am very disappointed
7,2.0,i bought this top in the store which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do i loved the flowy fit of it the washing instructions say machine wash cold tumble dry low i washed it on cold and hung it to dry it shrank to the point of being unwearable the dreaded button gap and lost its softness i hope the store lets me return it
8,2.0,i was excited to see this top ordered it and was disappointed it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom i tried this on times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments no luck
9,1.0,i dont normally review my purchases but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made i couldnt help myself but to post a review the neck line isnt even hemmed down so it flaps up the material is thin and feel cheap this dress isnt even worth in my opinion i was expecting a well made good quality dress for the high price tag
10,1.0,the only and the biggest problem im facing with this mobile is heating issue i afraid to attend long calls ie less than minutes on this set really im afraid of blast
11,2.0,this looks so gorgeous on the model on the site so i ordered it online it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on looks like i took a floor rug cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head the sweater itself is so pretty its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me i normally wear a small so i ordered the xss and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs its kind of itchy too will be returning this asap
12,5.0,not really much to comment on as i have had good experiences with sandisk ultra in the past they are a little more pricey than some of the other brands but only by a couple bucks what you get is no surprises they pop into your phone camera tablet and basically work forever i dont run speed tests so cant comment on whether they are plus minus milliseconds faster than another brand a millisecond here or there really is not a big deal to me ive never had a failure with a sandisk product or kingston another good valuei used it for awhile in my asus tablet but currently it has been moved over to my droid works as advertised a was an excellent value
13,3.0,fingerscan doesnt work sometimes apps crash and few other hitches
14,3.0,worked good for months and now the vibration stopped working and then the network keeps fluctuatingso always have to use airplane mode and then come back to normal in order to get the data working on the phonealthough it still works but not all of itmore of a jugaad workingnot expected from this phone
15,3.0,worth for to k good for basic users
16,3.0,direct video call facility not available
17,4.0,it is a good device but the ai and search parameters sometimes lack compared to siri
18,5.0,i saw the neutral motif in the theres only one left hanger in the store and tried it on its very pretty cute and sweet i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a babydoll look but thats just my preference i tried on size and its a bit tight in the chest area im b waist hips so i think size would fit very well despite the pretty flower design in my personal opinion i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric
19,2.0,slippery quality back covers are not available the way camera has been placed at backside is prone to scratches seems apple deliberately have designed so that customer is forced to go service center for repair or handset replacement product is over priced in terms of battery life poor battery lofe
20,1.0,battery life sucks works only for hours after full charge update even after full charge works for only mins send product for exchange and it has been more than days but didnt get any reply from boats team worst service they dont reply to emails or phone calls this is my ticket no hate it never buying boat products
21,3.0,quite a few bugs stop playing regularly i wasnt expecting better sound than the echo but i was expecting more than that sound quality is badapart from that works well
22,1.0,no proper guidance to install very poor product support by amazon
23,3.0,this suit itself is adorable i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big it says light padding but there is no padding just a giant empty cup im going to order the size medium
24,1.0,i brought it months back and it stopped working completely
25,1.0,im facing some speaker related issues and had given my handset xr gb in service center they denied to repair the same stating that the handset is fake and not valid for any warrenty
26,2.0,new phone i face problem no return option im getting today exchange
27,3.0,price is too high in this price range you can get much better than this not worth money
28,3.0,sound quality isnt the greatest when comparing it to the echo the echo is great
29,4.0,i bought onepluse first time and i am very happy with its performance camara quality and other things the only problem is battery life it drains very fast if i am playing games or watching the video its it gose to in just hrs if i am using it only music and chating it gose to in abut hrs with out any heavy use i compared battery like with onepluse t at t was giving hrs of life and my onepluse t was giving hrs of life about face unlock system i thik there is some problem with it even by brother can open my phone and we are not twins other then that its the one of the best phone i ever used
30,1.0,crashed lost everything thanks sandisk used in gsnot a solid product couple years worth of stuff gone in an instant
31,1.0,the phone is hanging video quality is not very good i would like to exchange the product with i phone xs if possible kindly help regards thank you
32,2.0,i usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me sadly this dress is a definite exception which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress as other reviewers stated the dress does run small but even if you size up if you have any breasts at all the dress will pull at the buttons causing them to gape im only a b cup so not on the large side im pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture i love
33,3.0,im not sure if it was my undergarments or not but the top clung to me in a strange way the colors are rich but in addition to the odd fabric the sleeves did not flatter my upper arms
34,4.0,product was good
35,3.0,the battery back up is worst after it reduces to within mins of video playback
36,1.0,not happy with the sound quality jbl speakers same size gives more loud sound and crsip one
37,1.0,so after a year of using it unfortunately the smc chip and memory synchronisation is at fault there is no manual resetting that works and the only option is to get the chips replaced which costs around k so much for long lasting though i must say it worked like a pro for year and now its time to bury it
38,5.0,superb story it teaches you to follow your destiny an amazing story by paulo coelho he is a superb author
39,2.0,not compatible mic receiving is not good
40,4.0,if provide headset cover tempered glass it will be better
41,2.0,was very disappointed with this product as its quite expensive in australia a bottle at first it started great made my hair nice smooth and smelt great i have super long hair so after a while it dried my hair out and then it began to make it knot in massive clumps ive never had knots so bad as soon as i stopped using this it fixed itself would not buy again
42,4.0,good buy solved my requirement
43,2.0,this is a beautiful vest i love the colorblocking the modern and structured style and its versatility i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash they spotcleaned it and it did bleed although the tag says to dry clean this baby the black dye will bleed to the white fabric ill be taking it back into the store today for a ref
44,5.0,i remember when i built computers that had x gb hard drives and by now most have googled to learn of the room sized computers with basketball sized transistorsmicro computer how long before our entire life will fit on something smaller than the point of a needle this sdxc disk has worked well with my nokia lumia windows phone my wife has one in her android phone and with kids taking pictures and making movies gb is starting to look like to little an amount of storage
45,5.0,its awesome iphone loaded with a pack of features face id and memoji is super thanks amazon and also to apple
46,1.0,face id is very very slow there seems to be a problem with the microphone there is an issue with the sensors microphone issues touch issues ive been trying to raise a complaint but the amazon support team is always redirecting me to the apple website ive been unable to return this item since ive discovered the problems i really need assistance on this matter
47,4.0,excellent phone so far bought it for more secure access fortunately amazon delivery this time was good my past delivery experience have been bad on downside this phone is heavy as brick compared to similarly sized s this is too heavy single hand use easily tired fingers and hand pictures are great but the wide angle is not good on people as it distorts edges in pictures speaker sound is also slightly mutted face id fails occasionally i can live with most of the issues but the weight of phone is dissapointing
48,1.0,installation partner not proper didnt come for installation
49,2.0,i agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that its a much lovelier color in person but thats about it for me thoughts below pros tts i ordered the medium for my c frame and found it sufficient the color is much nicer in person as the other reviewer mentioned its a richer brown think mocha latte in terms of color the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it
50,5.0,i use this because my office use all window os and im the only one with a mac os so file transfers between computers are easy with this little thing
51,1.0,worst phone i ever seen
52,1.0,mobile bill missing in the packet i need my mobile bill
53,5.0,great phone with great features delivered on time
54,4.0,nice mobile average quality
55,1.0,i had my eye on this dress for months i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures it was very bright which disappointed me its also made for more busty women at a d i could in no way fill this dress out the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering i felt like an old lady in a bag
56,4.0,finally got good product
57,4.0,i ordered this in the darker color i was excited to try it on when it arrived the fabric was really nice good quality and the design is so cute sadly it did not work for me there is a lot of volume especially in the back which does not work for my curvy shape i can see this top working well on a straighter figure but the volume and length really just did not flatter my hips and thighs i will be sending this back
58,5.0,super cute on i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable the slip is a tad tight but it doesnt bother me its stretchy so its not uncomfortable i bought size xsi usually wear a in dresses i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didnt need the petite i am lbs i loved the soft fabricfine for year round in southern cal
59,5.0,amazing im using it from last months and it charge my phone more than twice phone battery is mah still no other powerbank can beat this mi product

62,5.0,very nice product with all the features
63,4.0,everything about it was great except for the adapter it was to tight i had to use a tool to take it back out of the adapter causing me to chip it so my fault i guess but i also bought a gb version and the adapter for that one was fine
64,3.0,this is a very comfortable shirt great basic to have in the wardrobe it runs a little high on the sides
65,1.0,i wore these pants to work and they fit and looked great however the first time i put them through the wash they became all discolored and are completely stained and now are unwearable very disappointing did not spend that much money to wear a pair of pants once
66,3.0,no doubt this book has a very good content but the latest edition has lot of printing mistakesdifferent is the word which is misprinted everywhereyou have to take a guess on words while readingotherwise a nice book
67,2.0,this blouse has a very cute style the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami it also felt slightly on the small size almost too tight for my normal size
68,3.0,getting heat while charging
69,4.0,this is a classic pencil dress that would be becoming on most straight figures i always wear a or medium in hd and this dress is a little large everywhere i love it so much i paid full price and i will probably have it taken in on the sides if possible the lacework is gorgeous and sturdy it doesnt catch on stuff there is a lot of give to sit and move in unlike most pencil dresses and i cannot say enough about the color wow heads turn when you walk into a room in this gorgeous de

71,3.0,buy it
72,4.0,it is a good item just not what i was looking for if you want a medium waist and straight at the bottom it is great i am more of a high waist skinny bottom
73,4.0,i love it but i dont at the same time sheer so sheer you can probably get away with a nude bra but not sure i tried on both colors and love them both love the shimmer i ordered btoh xxs p and xxs regulari think i would go with regular the petite seemed cropped on me so if i lift my arms hello belly so overall i would probably get this if it goes on sale color is either way but since i dont have an immediate need i passed nice turtleneck though reference
74,5.0,pros affordable long life goos charging speed great metal feel cons not very impact resistant bad durability charging cable provided average packaging summary very good product and all the products can be taken care of by just handling well i would suggest buying this for anyone looking for affordable power banks
75,3.0,bells out to much i had to send it back
76,2.0,everything seemed fine the first day i had the echo i played with the settings changed the accent to british american alexa is too nasal sounding and linked to pandora iheartradio and tune in i was surprised at how often alexa didnt know the answer to simple questions she is definitely no apple suri i did find that i could not use the voice training feature clicking on it did nothingthe next morning alexa had changed when i asked about the weather she gave me the info in celsius she would also no longer link to pandora or iheartradio instead she would say that is not available in your region i checked everything includind address and all looked fine i did a factory reset but to no avail i then called amazon i was on the phone with them for over hours they could not find the problem they passed the ticket onto their web developer and said someone would call me back it was late so i was done for the nightthe next morning i reset everything again now pandora would work but not iheartradio still no voice training available i then changed alexas accent back to uk suddenly my apps were once again not available in your region and temps were again in celsius this is an obvious flaw in alexas software i returned the echo to best buy i will wait for a software upgrade before getting another onethe amazon serve rep calked me two days later to say that the ticket wss still open unsolved i told her that id returned the unit and why she said that their web developers were going to keep the ticket open i dont think this is much of a resolution also id like to change alexas voice to that of a male deeper and less nasal any chance of that happening

85,4.0,i was drawn to the shampooconditioner line after sampling the scent the scent is exactly like lipsmackers in vanillayum unfortunately it doesnt linger after the shower it contains no harsh ingredients that are often found in drugstore shampoosconditioners makes my hair really soft doesnt weigh it down and is really shiny overall performs well as far as drugstore shampoos are concerned

91,3.0,very delicate no manual and keys no one guided to install it
92,5.0,this is comfy and casual and fun to wear moss ombr is darker and less ombr than pictured so i wish i had gotten the other color way instead i can see myself wearing this for running errands grabbing takeout and other important things like hanging out on my couch definitely size down or this will look too wide boxy
93,3.0,some pages have bad prints its readable though
94,2.0,i loved this dress when i saw it online perfect for a summer wedding but when i tried it on i was very disappointed the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely it made me look very large i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail sadly it will have to go back it may look good on a very thin frame but didnt complement my average one
95,4.0,good phone at reasonable price

99,2.0,i was so excited about this top as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way unfortunately this top feels like an old grandmas polyester suit the sides are much shorter than the front back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way due to the layered fabric sadly going back
100,4.0,im happy i bought this top its very cute and almost a little immaturechildish but with the right bottoms it looks classy i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up it washes beautifully will probably not work on large chested women

116,2.0,this shirt was just really missing something for me i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection however the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking in addition the bow seemed to be too t

130,1.0,product stopped working in just days useless even the day return policy is over now no refund waste of my hard earned money
131,3.0,the picture of this top is misleading its more like a tent super short dress i ordered my usual size l and could easily get away with a small in this top if the arm holes were not too tight i def need to go down to a medium and maybe even a petite medium since im the top is cotton but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric it looks like a tent on plus the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le
132,3.0,lacks a bit of power and crispiness meant only for silent rooms and light listening driver produces good bass but could use a lil extra highs size is small so lack of power can be expected being a music producer these are my views its still good for music but cant perform well on movies until n unless u have a silent room not tried yet but i think it would be hard put to use it as the source of sound for more than a person or two as sometimes if the room has noise just the usual ambient noise of nearby roads ac fan etc you really have to put it close to your person in order to listen clearly
133,1.0,this is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesnt look anything like that in reality it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive

142,2.0,no no noi dont know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging or what but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down im about c usually wear a or in dresses this thing barely buttoned over my bust and then flares out to a tentlike triangular shape at the bottom i dont think it would come out by washing and ironing it im afraid it was just cut poorly i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes unfortunately i bought three different dresses in the

144,2.0,wanted to love this i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite not keeping this the side zipper a complaint by many really made it uncomfortable also the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd loved the material and definitely the green print but i knew i would never wear it just looked blah
145,1.0,sounds quality is not good
146,5.0,love this tank it is so soft and comfortable the length hits just right on the hip it hugs the body nicely not too tight just loose enough on a hot summer day i have this in black and white i wish they would offer more colors
147,1.0,after delivery it does not work
148,5.0,picture quality is pretty good and sound quality also nice phone in this price category
149,2.0,i love jumpsuits for their style and comfort i loved the look of this blue silky piece and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house i agree that it is like lounge wear but for me there were a few challenges first the fit was small i am usually anywhere between a and a depending on style cut and brand i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th
150,5.0,purchased this months before with afp vr after many random clicks i felt like i wanna buy a full frame bodyfinally i realized that photography is not about the camera its just a tool the creativity and imagination of the photographer is important than camera and expensive glassesso took some effort still learning and experimenting with my beloved girl d she can do more
151,3.0,this sweater was unflattering me very boxy and did not fall on me like the model soft fabric and looks nice off however this one went back
152,1.0,cons smells too sickly sweet amp fruity doesnt do its job at allnot moisturizing gives my hair an icky texture i ended up using it as a shaving cream
153,5.0,superbbb really very good phone in m series m superb battery life ohhgod full charge mobile also on date coming to hours superbbb fantastic thank you samsung team
154,1.0,i am purchased only for look this brand but camera quality is very bad plz dont waste your money for this mobile
155,3.0,i was surprised at the high quality of fabric however the dress looked like a muumuu on maybe with a belt it would be cuter
156,4.0,there is nothing to dislike about the product makes nice sound looks nice and price is low very nice product in this range
157,3.0,i can say value for money i got this rs screen resolution is not good sound quality is not good a bit heavy day light photographs are good but low light or night photographs are very poor battery is outstanding wide angle is good ringtones are low
158,4.0,our family really enjoys alexa overall i think the one hangup and its a major one imo is that she didnt come as a rechargeable unit the echo as is must be connected to power at all times other than that she is a helpful and entertaining addition to our household
159,4.0,phones look is elegant camera is also awesome battery life obviously is also unimaginable also fingerprint sensor works good face unlock also works in low light signifies it is also phenomenal but i am not happy with its performance its somewhat slow if you wanna buy a phone for gaming then choose another but if you are heading for looks camera battery life and no heating issues then i think this can be your choice
160,3.0,with jio sim this phone not comfort and some calling issues raised with jio number without internet the jio sim not working with redmi y
161,4.0,i bought this on th of october everything is good with this phone inches super amoled display gives awesome picture quality its mah battery with watt fast charger inside the box has drastic backup upto one and a half day once it gets full charged i have been using this phone for around or days and found no issues like hanging problem updated with androids pie version with samsung one ui its user interface is very good gb with gb storage optimising well to if there are lots of apps running in background but i wanna add here a wrong things about this phone first of all its camera isnt so good as it should have been within this price rs it dosent have slow motion feature and thats the one thing to regret the biggest problem with this phone is that it is heating up too much if you use its camera to capture any photos or shoot any videos
162,1.0,is not good phon
163,1.0,it is unfortunate that this kind of product is being sold on amazon innocent customers like me are trapped by lucrative offers only to discover later that it lacks basic features to run it in a different country like us india should ban this product and so should amazon i would request full refund on this product as it does not meet basic requirement of a mobile device nowhere in the sales document did they mention in clear visible font that honor x doesnt work in some countries like usa amazon should also look into such spurious products being sold on its platform we customers trust amazonbut in case of any breach this can lead to negative feedback about amazon
164,5.0,alexia is amazing
165,5.0,the pictures online do not do this jacket justice i saw it hanging in the store and had to have it even before i tried it on its extremely versatile worn as shown as a layered look or the zipped liner is can be removed and this can be worn as a simple blazer its the perfect weight for springfall its fitted and so cute this jacket runs true to size not large i usually wear a and the small fit perfectly
166,1.0,dear sir we are facing sim slot is not working properly i need help to service where i visited to service
167,1.0,bettery bear he
168,5.0,really very fast access to face recognition
169,1.0,worst product ever i use
170,2.0,not a big fan of alexa she doesnt know as much as other apps
171,4.0,it is a very best mobil
172,3.0,i think everything about this brand is bogus organix does not even use organic ingredients it just plays on the name to confuse people and convince them to pay more for inferior products and nonorganic ingredients this shampoo does not work as well as other cheaper shampoos and actually left my roots greasy and my ends frizzy i would not repurchase this product
173,4.0,vert good but i preferred the rotary volume dial on the original
174,3.0,when we tell one to play music it plays it on the other dot where we cant hear it cant figure out how to solve the problem making it useless to us also didnt realize you have to enable a bunch of random apps on it just to ask different questions i thought you could just ask it all sorts of questions and it would answer meh
175,5.0,this is maybe my th personal power bank i have used anker adata plantronics ambrane intex generic ones iwalk and more most of them promise too much but by keeping the price tag low you end up losing on genuine quality and assured performance with the mi power bank you get what is promised this is one difference that i noticed the power bank was mostly charged when i needed it to be charged and after having used it for days i can safely say it has a great capacity of holding the charge what phones devices does this charge for me s plus iphone fitbit blaze once a week and my amazon fire tv when i dont have a power plug to plug it does it fast charge yes it fast charges the s plus this means it saves me the time and hassle of connecting with the wall charger yes the wall charger is still little faster as wall charger uses a charging and this uses a charging i think but this is a major positive can it be used to charge two devices the good news is that the times i have used this with both devices i have not seen any reduction in performance quality it keeps the power going and seems to be able to support it if its fast charging in one then it is giving consistent charge to the other slot too how often do i charge it maybe once a week not more than a maximum of twice a week can it charge a macbook i tried to use this and in one hour it only adds to my macbook pro touchbar so it is not worth it how long does it last lets say it will charge both my phones maybe times in total before giving up who should get this if you have one phone and it dies easily you should get this as this will keep it charged i suggest you charge only till and then disconnect if you have two phones this is a good device how long does it take to charge i have never measured it but with the accompanied cable and my samsung fast charger adapter it charges in hours to this is not bad for me as i plug it in overnight drawback mi is a chinese company and i feel a little bad for using it but the product is good if you forgive the political inferences thanks
176,1.0,saw this on line and decided to splurge for the holidays arrived today and is going right back runs very small especially in the waist trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture appears cheap and very itchy sooooo disappointed
177,4.0,great quality producthave a good experience using itits a money worthplease go n purchase it immediatelyplease recommend to others also
178,1.0,i suggest please dont buy this productas machine is okbut have network issue as i am not able to excess g in this phonei bought phone in both phone i am not able to excess geven though when i use same sim in another phone thats working very finewhen i approach to the amazon they just up their handsso suggest please dont go with this worst phone
179,2.0,after a month of usageit got slipped from handand whole dispaly got brokenno corilla glass is therei invested to samsung service center for displaywhile paying there was no option of insurance was there or for extended guarantee
180,2.0,this phone doesnt qualify for k price segment and feels more like k price segment on specs sheet they have mentioned all the hifi tech but the fact is some components are at the lowest quality to start with the futuristic indisplay fingerprint reader is the worst i have ever used and seen and it doesnt work of times and you will literally get irritated and depressed more from this one feature i would suggest xiaomi to keep fingerprint sensor at the back like their other flagships the display is amoled and brightness and feel is good but when it comes to resolution in viewing videos or playing gamespubg i feel the worst display ever build quality is good camera quality is another gimmick the photo clarity is good in main lens but in wide angle camera and depth sensor camera are just worst part of the camera segment you will loose clarity as you switch between lenses andriod ui is really great performance wise the phone is good for normal call text and internet usage and not good for hardcore games fast charging is really good and the battery life is also good i will not suggest this phone to anyone as you can get better phones at lower price than this
181,5.0,i saw this blouse referenced online a few times and have a weakness for white blouses so off i went to my local retailer this blouse turned out to be delightful my thoughts i would say it fits true to size as a fits me perfectly in the shoulders it is a flowy tunic blouse that has a high skit so its not possible to wear this as a dress it is very sheer too i do think this blouse is designed for the line to hit below the bust so my incredibly flat chest works in this if you have even
182,5.0,love it when i cant sleep i just ask alexa to put on a meditation station and i go right back to sleep
183,1.0,battery backup is quite poorneeds two times charging in a daynot good enoughits nd time within months screen got damagedbeing it a gorilla glasswaste of moneyi am not able to understand what kind of gorilla glass it iswhich cant tolerate a jerk just from my bed to ground i am quite disappointed with the quality of the productand even disappointed with amazon that it is entertaining such cheap productswithin months i had to change my battery because of poor performance and after that screen damagenow again within months its nd time the screen got damaged
184,3.0,charging issue just after one month of use
185,3.0,i bought this a little under a year ago to use with my laptop worked just as advertised for much of that time until it stopped letting me write or delete stuff from it could read just fine i couldnt even format it so it kinda just sat there for a while after trying to format it a number of different ways i finally contacted sandisk and they said they will send me a replacement free of charge i would have maybe given this a lower rating but the customer service from sandisk made up for the faulty card i am just glad it fell under a warranty period i think had the card not failed i would have given five stars if sandisk wouldnt replace it would have given one star hopefully the latter doesnt happen to you
186,2.0,i have been looking for an offwhite vest and thought this one would be perfect except it is going back i am lbs medium is my normal top size but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture no buttons so no way to close it unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo not worth the price
187,5.0,fouwnd good result
188,4.0,got it in inr only bad thing is amazons packing for this product sound quality is just awesome perfect match of treble n bass colour is also soothing recommendable to everyone
189,4.0,i have purchased this product several times now and overall been pretty pleased i use it on damp hair before i blow dry and on dry hair after i have straightened it argan oil is good for heat protection so this will be a nice product to use in your hair care routine i dont think this product is a miracle worker by itself but it does give a nice glisten and shine to hair while calming frizz and flyaways very affordable price as well and can be found at most drugstores target walmart and ulta for those of you with hair that can easily get oily however beware i have dry hair and if i apply this too close to my hair or use too much my hair can get oily after all this is a concentrated oil spray so what i do to get best results is spray about quot away from my hair in a circular motion and let the spray mist down that way it is not too slick but still provides sheen
190,2.0,display quality is the worst too slow for serious work
191,3.0,body is made of plastic which makes it quality inferior and does not give it a premium look like other samsung phones nfc is no future technology and missing it in a latest phone does make it lack at some point face unlock is not faster and effective speed proceesor exynos wont give more effective speed when you are using multiple apps opened in parallel in that way you always need to go with snapdragon camera is just okay
192,4.0,best mobile within this price range original xiaomi product
193,3.0,guys dont buy white colour it looks cheapgo for some other colour advantages sound quality is great disadvantages doest built to lastcrap cheap material is used here
194,2.0,really really wanted to love this device but have ended up hating it its like a petulant defiant five year old doing whatever it pleases and nothing i ask of it for the most part i have had no issues with amazon per se but i feel so duped by alexa i read all the time about the new things added that alexa can do but for some reason i cant and i just dont get it it could be user error but im not that stupid the most infuriating problem is the fact that i bought three of the echo dots and three bluetooth speakers to pair in three different locations of my house this was one of the new features delivered about a month ago cant be done thinking it was the speakers i made a call to cambridge soundworks where i was told it was the echo and after a call to amazon cust serv they affirmed my desire was to avoid as many wires as possible as i feel overrun by them at times had to buy three mini cables to hook them up to the speakers to run music throughout house and of course the speakers have to be plugged into wall bc all three cant be run off bluetooth at the same time another example when i ask alexa to play a particular song by a particular artist alexa plays it one day and when asked the next day i get sorry i couldnt find this happens constantly ive also noticed when i ask to just play some damn music she selects the absolute worst songs for that artist or genre and ive noticed some of the music being streamed on my amazon music account is not by the original artists they actually stream cover groups these are but a few of my complaintswondering if anyone else might be experiencing similar problems
195,4.0,i straighten my hair quite often this oily helps me leave my hair shiny after i mercilessly hurting it with the heat i probably should fix my hair routine first but anyway this is a great stuff it doesnt make my hair greasy excellent product a tiny bit goes a long way
196,2.0,i had high hopes for this shampoo since i have fine thin hair this shampoo make my hair dry and heavy the next day it was matted to my head it felt coated and i got no volume whatsoever the only positive is the smell
197,4.0,good product totally satisfied in this price pros almost everything cons gb internal storage
198,4.0,this dress is adorable i plan on wearing it as maid of honor in my sisters wedding next year i am in between a size and usually go with because im a bit busty and have some hips but since i got it after it was put on clearance only a size was availableit turned out to be a perfect fit literally i tried it on braless if i had any sort of padded bra then i would have trouble fitting in the top section which worked out perfectly since the arm holes are a bit low i think it
199,3.0,so this is just the most lovely romper beautifully made flowey very comfortable until you have to take it off this is the review i posted on facebook so no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror or maybe has not shared with me that moment when you cannot get out of because it has turned into a straight jacket that otherwise cute romper and again maybe a man invented it
200,1.0,cant play music when another echo is playing anymore september i bought multiple devices and my kids could listen to lullabies while kitchen or living room devices were playing other music not anymore amazon introduced multiroom music but disabled multistreams i feel cheated imagine listening to a song and somebody else stops it all the time i listen to maybe minutes of music a day and now i have to wait for my turn
201,4.0,only complaint is that the music goes in and out alexa cant tell me why it is happening

209,2.0,price too high
210,2.0,product quality is very low totally cheap plastic use for making this i am very disappointed by samsung i gifted to my low
211,3.0,any possible to return this product as its irritating the eyes and creating head ache if using for hour continuously
212,2.0,this dried my hair out and tangled it up so bad it smells great and i was excited to use it because actual argan oil was nice on my hair and skin but for some reason this just mummified my hair
213,1.0,had a similar issue with a mackbook pro wrote to tim cook and returned it after months to amazon as they were not be able to solve the heating issues and starting up issues
214,4.0,great top but it runs smaller than other tops in this brand the chest and arm area is small otherwise this top is great just plan to size up one or two sizes length was nice hit right at the waist
215,2.0,video quality gets screwed in super steady mode it adds lot of dots in video and clarity becomes pathetic also it takes hrs for charging and so is not fast charging as mentioned by samsung
216,2.0,the mobile charging pin got damaged just after a month of buying this product voice quality is very bad
217,1.0,not impressed with alexa at all it is on a wrong time zone dont know how to change it is not connected anyway with the tv and the gentleman that hooked up our dish did not explain anything about it i am not happy with that at all its a worthless piece of equipment
218,2.0,used product recieved with a broken seal delivery was fast but product had quality issues
219,4.0,product works as advertised no issues with install or general use in my mobile phone it doesnt seem particularly snappy but that may be more the phone than anything else
220,2.0,i am giving two star because one speaker is not working and camera is not good as i aspect
221,2.0,the color design and fabric of this top got it in the red were just as i expected but as the owner of several deletta brand tops i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes and the top just hangs on me it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style will try an xs
222,1.0,i bought the samsung ms on th sept but i am highly disappointed with this phone due to the following reasons camera quality is pathetic i dont think its mp the phone didnt read my simi used multiple sims
223,4.0,things i like about product the overall build quality the display the battery the value for money i bought opal balck for including cashback what i dont like i expected a better camerabecause its samsung but camera quality is average video stabilization is worst in daylight you get good photos but they doesnt look as good as other mp cameras hope a software update may change things
224,2.0,dear friends features of phone are power packedbut these are not actually when u start usingprocessor is slowbattery life is not good mh last for a single day dispite very limited useonly pros is camera quality n displayface unlock is also faster snapdragon is always better than exynos this is second time i m disappointed with exynos
225,2.0,not a fan of amazon having the ability of spying on us
226,5.0,i upgraded a generic small micro sd card i had on hand and was using in my gs this card is very fast making for seamless read and write of pictures video and playback of music stored on the sd card it works great which is exactly what i have come to expect from all sandisk products
227,4.0,good processing speed documents load faster laptop boot within second and shut down within second one star less for average look
228,5.0,the best k tv superb picture quality sound value for money thos who checking this reviews just go for it note this tv will be a game changer if you add any android tv box friends who ever purchased this tv or going to purchase please buy screen guard for your tv why iam telling you this coz i lost my tv panel at home some reason it is very painful so take care thos who are planning to buy just go for it shinco tv is excellent in all the way i will buy this tv again soon
229,3.0,battery charger got defective within months and no response from nikon
230,4.0,nice jacket good quality flattering design im lbs bought a size s and fits well love the hood a little snug in the arms if you want to wear a long sleeve underneath overall a good buy
231,4.0,good for beginners
232,2.0,after i had layers added to my bob i started styling my hair to take advantage of some natural curl that i suddenly discovered my stylist said a heavy hairspray would weigh down the waves so i bought this finishing spray on the plus side it keeps my hair soft not crunchy the minus my hair is fine and needs a stronger hold if i want the curl to be exactly as it was immediately after styling i will use up the product especially on days when i go overboard im still experimenting and dont mind if the curls relax also my husband compliments me on how good my hair smells when i use this i think it reminds him of coconut cake
233,4.0,okay hai but jyda khas nhi h selfie or back camera okaydisplay hd m mja nhi h ok
234,2.0,based on the other reviews i sized down from my usual p to a p but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldnt work i cant imagine this would flatter very many people the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive very disappointedthis will be going back for sure
235,1.0,very bakwas product it stopped working after months and service centre said there are scretch so will not be given or repair gye pani mein very chalo policy do not buy no warranttee at all worst than local product no warranty only assurance
236,4.0,i really wanted to love this dress the pattern is so much prettier in person i typically wear a medium sometimes a large in tops the medium in this dress was too tight in my chest the large fit my chest but was ridiculously large in other areas the front of the dress goes up pretty high for someone with a large chest and flows down there is a tie in the back but it doesnt do much to help with the shape in the front
237,1.0,the heart rate monitor in this band is fake i placed this band on a cloth and was shocked to see the readings
238,1.0,i thaught it is a physical book not a pdf or online as nothing about delivery is written
239,1.0,poor camera
240,1.0,got a refurbished broken product when replaced which is currently not working when the emi for the product is yet to be paid fully
241,2.0,i really want to like this item voice recognition is excellent but speaker quality is horrible my iphone s speaks sound way better for my is not an option and external speaker
242,5.0,this top looks even better in person the green is a little brighter than the photo this beautiful blouse is silk with a sold underlining it is very full and has great flow and movement super trendy with the open shoulders and a nice long sleeve for fall its really beautiful and perfect for any festive occasion
243,5.0,top is blouse and long enough to stay tucked in if you want like the laser cut detail front and back sleeveless is great for summer months here can wear to work or dress down with jeans fit is true to size i am slim and small busted so anything fits me i would think it youre busty it would be fine as its a blousy fit the color is more of a salmon pink which works for me however if your looking for a true pink it may not work
244,2.0,phone was ok but bettery life is not ok i have truble with bettery life is very low hours on normal uses
245,5.0,i love this product i have wavy hair that gets dry at the ends and this stuff makes it super soft it feels light and makes my hair very shiny its a very fine mist that goes on dry not wet oily when i first used it i thought my hair might have looked the tiniest bit piecey like when it starts to get oily but i brushed it through first with a detangling brush and again with a boar brush and my hair completely soaked it up i use this a couple of times a day now and havent had the same issue since i put in a few spritzes while my hair is damp and a bunch more when its dry concentrating most of the sprays at the ends but then one or two overtop of my whole head then finger comb it through followed by a light brushing if needed i love the smell too i know a few people werent too happy with the scent but i think its very pleasant my partner told me quotoh wow your hair smells amazing what is that you smell like a mermaidquot the price isnt terrible but its up there cad in my area but i think its worth it just days after i bought it along with the shampoo and conditioner which i highly recommend as well i found out that all ogx products are on sale at my pharmacy for less than the usual price so im going back to stock up while theyre on sale
246,5.0,this was an inexpensive way to get my galaxy note ii from gb to gb of memory its plenty fast and can hold lots of photos music etc
247,2.0,its beautiful lovely quality gorgeous bird but the fit just doesnt work for me im usually a medium which is what i got its just too tight in the chest for ref d as is it already flares out some in the bottom so im not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately
248,4.0,im glad the previous reviews had mentioned the dolman sleeves so i was better prepared for how it would fit you do have to do some rearranging of the fabric but it generally stays put and isnt bothersome the neckline is a bit more structured than shown in the pictures but it only adds to a more sophisticated look great fabric and color as well
249,5.0,features r nice n sound system is nice easy to understand all features n all facilities is given what required for smart tv in cheaper rate
250,3.0,product is as good as described but delivery took place in days
251,4.0,i had higher hopes for this top and thought it would be fanicer but as a previous reviewer mentioned the quality of the material and elastic waistband makes the top look a little cheaper in person im glad i got it on sale with the extra off i was hoping to exchange it for a small but its sold out by now the top runs a little large normally im between a small and a medium but i think a small might even be too big i put it on this morning in the dark and by the time i got to work
252,1.0,was a defective piece had to return because they had no replacement
253,3.0,i used this product twiseit couldnot control the frizz but my hair fall became lessmy hair a silky and soft and it remained like it was but the smell would vanish i dont know if to use it again or not
254,4.0,good mobile
255,2.0,battery life is very bad poor quality camera also
256,1.0,sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was
257,1.0,so worst camera front and backsound quality is also not gudbetter check with another mobiles for this why people are giving and stars dont know those are fake are genuine i get doubt abt these product
258,1.0,i was not knowing that this product is that much cheap very worst productplease do not buy this productbetter to by any hp r dell instead of this worst product within one year i got a problem on logic motherboard how come in a year that was not resolved seriously hell plz dont buy waste of money
259,4.0,it made my hair feel slightly softer and shinier but if i accidentally apply too much it would make my hair very greasy and flat overall this product is nice but you just have to be careful of how much of the product you use
260,4.0,now i have used this phone for about weeks it performance daily uses is good battery is the best part of it however i am not satisfied with finger print performance and camera quality hope in future they can be improved with software update as i am sure its hardware is capable of doing wonders in budget range its a good buy with brand assurance of samsung
261,3.0,it doesnt support as regards the matter of changing system fonts users like me wish to change the fonts of our device and this device falls short of it if possible the company must give any solution for this problem through any special update good picture quality some other features but the phone doesnt have inbuilt fm radio automatic call recorder while these features are the need of time this model falls short of it
262,3.0,i am using it from year and it is not working properly it shows me fully charged but when we charge my mobile two times then it goes dead after charging my mobile when i bought itthen it working properly it was easily charge the mobile three to four times when it was fully charge nowaday we cant charge even two times that is not good
263,4.0,i am using this phone since last month and its very good phone in budget i am not a big fan of samsung mobiles till now but this mobile changed my mind camera is good low light photography is below average battery champ after a heavy use for the day still not craving for charging just after purchasing got android pie and one ui very user friendly and intuitive good ram management no performance lag faced till now cool dude no heating problem faced despite of playing games and heavy usage of social media overall verdicts should buy if you are planning
264,5.0,awsome watch with lotsz of features
265,5.0,fine with it
266,2.0,thank goodness i bought only a couple of the trave sized bottles it felt very drying on my hair and made my hair tangled it doesnt lather that well either so im surprised it would be so stripping it does have a nice scent and left my hair shiny but that is pretty much it i am very disappointed as i have had luck with other organix shampoos in the past my favorite is the macadamia one in the brown bottle i will probable reserve the remaining bottles for when i need to clarify or pass them on to family members back to the drawing board
267,1.0,i dont receive the echo dot nd generation
268,2.0,in only month heating problem occuringand in year almost every part is not working
269,4.0,the phone is quite slim and smooth and gives a nice feel to the hands the rear camera requires a little more of work but still gets the picture clicked in a decent way the only thing this phone lacks is the absence of a mp front camera which would have just made the whole experience great battery backup is really a monster and has no comparison in its cost segment samsung had developed an amloed display so they give the best in class display experience overall the phone is packed with features and is more than what anyone can bargain in the cost
270,5.0,absolutely love everything about this dress unlike many other dresses ive ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest c its very flattering love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen cant wait to wear it i got the s regular if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right like it was made for me
271,4.0,i didnt really pay this dress much attention online or even in store an associate suggested i try it on its so much cuter on than it appears online the button detail is great and i love the pockets it does bunch up a little but not too bad i tried on my normal size or and the fit me perfectly it was a tad long and maybe the petite will be better i have fairly sensitive skin and the wool pieces were a bit itchy so i had to take it back but if you arent sensitive then this is for
272,5.0,this phone is amazing if you want a phone with amazing battery life then go for it and camera is also very good very happy to buy this
273,2.0,poor camera quality
274,2.0,i have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar i checked the instructions and it says cold water wash so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled looks like the popsicles are melting im so sad because this dress is adorable im buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one should be dry clean only
275,4.0,it is a very good product my budget is tight then after a lot of resach i purchased this phonedecent phone for young generation everything is good but camera is ok
276,2.0,this looks cute on the model but was way too big loose and sloppy for me i probably needed a petite size i ordered a regular xs but returned it it is an okay black top nothing great
277,5.0,awsum phone but have a doubt about what accessories come with phone
278,2.0,the first time i wore it felt wonderful had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling very disappointed with the price and quality wish i could return for my money back sad
279,3.0,absolutely stinning dress statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipperone if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky i am on the fence about whether or not its a keeper definitely perfect for the smaller chested i usually wear xs size the zipped the nearly did but wouldve smashed neverth
280,1.0,phone is not getting on not expected i received defective phone
281,5.0,the product is very good very fast delivery by amazon phn has very descent camera and screen u guys go for it

283,5.0,nice mobile as expected quality and color is good picture quality is niceno hang better for this cost
284,4.0,i am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall as mentioned in another review it runs large in the armholes and across the bust which is why im counting off one star the armholes are also cut in quite a bit so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely however i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look that said the detailing i

287,5.0,amazing product grab it people its brilliant at this price
288,1.0,i have received a faulty phone
289,2.0,i agree with the other reviewer the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea but bad in execution they look and feel odd when on these fit tts and they are soft with decent stretch but the rise is much lower on me than other rise jeans i have as a yearold woman they seemed inappropriately lowhanging on me as an aside these will def color transfer there is a whole lotta rinse on these and they have a strange chemical smell to them not sure if that will diss
290,4.0,i really love the look and style of these i am not a fan of thong underwear definitely prefer these bikini or hipster styles but sometimes its hard to find them in attractive design this pair is definitely attractive and i like how they fit and look a lot ive only worn them once and they held up well for the day i often find lace can rip on the first wear so i was wary they did okay but i do worry that they seem delicate enough i could accidentally stuck a thumb through it and rip
291,2.0,i had hoped to link it so it could make a phone call in case of emergency to my cellphone or to my sons phone but find i cannot find instructions to do that and perhaps the device cannot do that
292,2.0,android one is not user friendly as miui call recording not available others like touch camera and battery life is upto the mark my suggestion to others to purchase note pro or note pro rather mia
293,1.0,this concerns that since the day i have started the phone from the day i received have faced apple product authentication issue really bad that cant trust ecomm for purchase of phone so i had to go to a apple repair center to get a new phone swapped thanks amazon for a bad experience
294,3.0,the pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous overall not my favorite
295,2.0,i ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large i liked the color the sleeves but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage overall it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me im sending this one back
296,4.0,phone battry mh is good no tension once fully recharge at travelling face recognition and fingerprint is smooth my friend suggest me too buy mi xomi inplace of this mega pixel option availble wherebut i want non china compny phone bycott chinaso i prefer this n camera quality is not bad also time fast charging option i am satisfy with the product in mi phone lot of permission access option given also when not necessary hacking plb

310,1.0,i expected better volume and base sound totally disappointed with this philips bt speaker i wanted to return this product but there is no return option for this speaker thats too bad waste of money think twise before you buy this product

312,2.0,im upset i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper the picture of the grey does not have a zipper i prefer no zipper so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper i was disappointed its going back why have a model where an item that youre not offering
313,2.0,phone is having a overheat issue when i connect to wifi or connect device to tv phone is getting too much heat even seeing little heat when i keep phone in pocket and go out is this problem with all devices or specific issue only with my device
314,1.0,this stuff does the opposite of what it says i was looking for a replacement for the garnier and nuance versions that the stores around me stopped carrying those gave me volume and texture and seemed to absorb a bit of oil this spray instead comes out very wet it instantly makes hair go limp i used it twice after curling my hair and both times it ruined the curl it is more like a shine spray but too heavy and wet to even recommend for that this brand always suckers me in with the scents and packaging but i think im giving up on it
315,4.0,good phone fingerprint good workcamera quality is average battery life is average and the bad part is very bad display
316,3.0,the reason behind giving stars is it has too much heating issue even though its on charge for minutes otherwise its a good quality of phone kindly tell me how can i solve this heating issue
317,4.0,there is no auto call recording and sound recording feature which is very basic thing now a days very disappoint to purchase this product
318,5.0,excellent features within medium budget strongly recommend i bought phones battery excellent display sound operating outstanding camera is little disappointment against one plus phones of same mp yet worth to buy
319,3.0,overall its good camera quality is good it depends on which product you are comparing hardware information is missing do not know whether samsung hide purposely or not all kind of application works fine the screen is really good sound quality fair call quality good no less highfrequency noise observed during callin open area samsung automatically uninstalls few necessary applications gpay quick ride and many more which i used as a daily bases unzip didnt worked
320,1.0,dont buy for sonos control i was lured by a coupon and quickly realized that its functions in sonos are stop volume up volume down it cannot add or delete zones distinguish that a zone is part of a group or play your sources attached to sonos other than itself it is a portal for amazon music which it jumps to all the time asking you if you want to move from music prime to music unlimited it inexplicably turned the volume all the way up on a zone i was listening too in the dead silence of the kitchen this morning it piped up with a verbal ad for something i was so shocked i did not even understand what i pulled the plug at that and set up the return its bad enough to be bombarded with ads through all types of media without it coming at you from a dot on your kitchen counter

326,2.0,the product i received has a manufacturing defat one edge of the laptop is making a weird popping noise getting it exchanged is a tedious process disappointed
327,1.0,i also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it the fabric is made of cheap poly thats shiny thin and clingy it shows every lump and bump you have the zipper at the back wont lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump the sewing and hemline is uneven there wasnt a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline
328,1.0,i would say the skirt runs two sizes too small i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews i purchased a large i could barely get the skirt over my hips even if it fit in the waist it was much too short on me and im its a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween
329,1.0,got damaged product

337,5.0,i love this blazer so much i bought it in both colors im pounds and bought the size which is perfect initially when i tried it on in the store i thought i needed the because it was a little tight in the arms and shoulders the was too boxy on me and im so glad i went with the it stretched especially the arms and fits perfect i love how i can dress this down with a graphic tee and jeans or dress up with a blouse and cropped black pants

340,4.0,this sweater is very nice i bought it online recently with a discount on the discount and felt i got an amazing bargain it is not larger than expected but is not exactly the fit the models picture implies it is a roomier design nonetheless it is wellmade and all wool instead of that mystery mix of fibers that sometimes is the case with things described as wool the one thing that might be more discouraging to online buyers is that the color is not the lovely blue the picture depicts
341,3.0,uncertain about sizing i got both the the both made me look like a noasser neither fit quite right in the leg both hit at a weird point in my calf not cuteshort just off im and to quote my husband nope not feeling these that said they feel great on seem to be made well but are heading back to an retailer near you sigh the quest continues
342,4.0,this dress is easy to wear lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple i love that its so colorful but for some reason the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin im sure on someone else this will be beautiful i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust although to be fair i am smallchested
343,1.0,it is only ghz to ghz
344,3.0,no
345,4.0,phone is good in this budget but the performance is average only as it slow down many times cannot handle multiple tasks at a time camera is good battery life is very good
346,5.0,fingerprint scanner is little annoying as it takes a bit more time than usual to read but overall the camera and battery life are just magnificent

355,5.0,memory card works fine no problems i have a number of sandisk memory cards and ive never had any problems with them
356,3.0,loved this dress and ordered it based on glowing reviews ordered size large because i weigh pounds and have a large g bust the dress skimmed nicely over my body but the baby doll style fit loosely and made me look really wide from the side i probably could have sized down for a better fit but it might have just emphasized my bust the fabric has a substantial weight and its lined best as a fall winter dress the embroidery is beautiful i disliked the intense black color around my f
357,3.0,the dress is precious and looks good on all body types however the bust is extremely tight i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area

364,5.0,i love these bottoms great colors i also love the feel of the bottoms very soft high quality
365,2.0,not satisfied with the battery life of the product even after judicious use it doesnt last for day and after ios update its draining even faster the new control centre doesnt work properly wifi and bluetooth doesnt close completely even after closing it
366,3.0,need something more
367,5.0,card works fine with no hiccups or issues speed of card is fine with the dash camera and download to laptop
368,2.0,not good after months there is issue that power bank was not charge some times or takes days to charge full customer service is also bad if we dont have service center near us wear we can go waste of money and battery backup is also around mah but on product there is mah mentioned
369,3.0,overall its a beautiful dress and i really wanted it to work but the material feels cheap at least not what youd expect for the price and as other reviewers have mentioned its just a tad too short for reference im lbs and the fit well but hung well above my knees theres no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people sadly this dress will be returned
370,3.0,i do not love these pants while the fabric is nice they make me look rather dumpy i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender these pants make me look like ive put on pounds and they also make me look rather squat perhaps they would look good on someone tall but at these are a miss for me
371,3.0,the phone sometime is slow and doesnt show when the phone is coming you can only hear the ring but can not see who is calling also the speaker option in whats app doesnt work properly
372,2.0,i did not like this it smelled great i put on when my hair was wet and it felt like i had shampoo in that needed to be rinsed out i guess because of the lathering ingredient in it when my hair dried it was flat and limp i have fine hair i ended up trying to use it to shave so i wouldnt waste it and it was no good at that either threw it away
373,3.0,im alittle disappointed with the echo dot very underwhelming great for making shopping lists though and looking up recipes
374,2.0,very poor quality by mi battery very poor results camera also not good very poor quality in pictures
375,4.0,the price is reasonable with the sound quality and battery life
376,4.0,i like this dress because its the perfect shape on me and i think the design is modern and cute i got the red and i really like the pattern and the subtle tulle edging the material is a little stretchy and substantial and theres also a lining i wore it with little booties like the model and tights and a cropped moto jacket and loved the outfit i am short small chest but somewhat broad shouldered the empire waist would not work on larger chested women with hourglass figures
377,3.0,like the idea of this shirt so much but the neckline was still way too low the top of my bra was visible wishing the under layer really covered as no way im going to another layer to an already layered shirt might just be my body type so might work for someone else but sending back
378,2.0,its been just days for me to observe this tv however i hv noticed that redpinkgreen etccolour are too deep and feels too much on flourocent side it doesnt give actual color that it should look already raised this issue with amazon they asked me to observe for couple of days more
379,2.0,its more of a brand value music quality is decent but no wow factor there very regular call quality looks very delicate it does noise cancellation by snug fit but same thing makes it uncomfortable to wear more than a hour
380,5.0,its really greatconverted my dumb tv to smart one
381,2.0,cant live up to my expectations
382,1.0,defect product
383,2.0,loved it online for its modern cut and print however when i received the item i was disappointed i ordered my usual size and i was swimming in it i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way however this was not flattering i would say i would have needed to size down to a and perhaps it would work but i didnt want to take another chance the material seemed almost crepey which i wasnt neccissarily expecting either bummer that it didnt work out
384,1.0,echo is totally worthless wont stay connected and is very limited dont buy
385,5.0,its a light material so it flows the shine is just enough to dress up when i need im a and usually buy xl of any tshirt looking style but the large fit perfectly i am however not large breasted
386,5.0,one month used i am satisfied
387,5.0,the product is reasonable price containing all features and delivery given by seller is at appropriate time
388,2.0,where is app download option frustrating and what old model remote is given even the three year warranty given on facebook tv looks wrong amazon representative dont have any clue of that i recommend not to buy this tv instead buy any normal non smart tv and use fire stick anyways we have to use fire stick upset with this product
389,4.0,i have received the phone in good condition today but the box does not contain guarantee card user manual and soft case as published by amazon what to do
390,5.0,its a good price and have never had any issues with the card deciding to stop recording i have used it in a hero and always recording in p at fps
391,4.0,quick little puppy sandisk makes nice quality stuff with one exceptionthe adapter that came with it to let it work in the bigger slot failed horribly after daysadapters pshbut my transformer likes it treats it like a child and it fits very snugly into the latching system a recent store bought one wiggles
392,2.0,i wanted to like this sporty dress too i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go go go being on every secondthe armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared i didnt like the middle ridge either as it was unflattering it was returned

398,5.0,i have long fine straight easy to frizz asian hair and i wash my hair daily i dont like to put a lot of products in my hair since most of them dont really work or just weight my hair down this really solves the frizzy hair problem even my husband notices and knows about the quotmagic blue bottlequot original package was blue that really works it tames the frizz adds shine strengthens and makes my hair healthier and it smells great best product great price i like everything about it i use it everyday and cant live without please never discontinue this
399,3.0,battery and camera average slow motion video option not available there is no pulse notification lightseven for battery charging not good for heavy users except gb rom there are so many additional features in other brand mobiles of same price range
400,5.0,very easy to setup connected to the internet quickly excellent quality
401,5.0,a must buy
402,4.0,suprb camera
403,3.0,i loved this top when i saw it online i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly it is not the top for me if you have a large chest then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly if i were an a or b this probably would have worked i should have known to stay away from a pleated top
404,1.0,the apps from play store is not getting dowmloaded and installed
405,5.0,the product is very goodsmalleasily portable and the sound is too good to be expected
406,5.0,i dont really know what to say accept that it does the job i use it with my sony action cam and so far so good
407,3.0,i was a little disappointed since it came without a box so where do i leave the adapter while the card is in the camera
408,5.0,mi mah power bank fully hard metal body due to metal body it will become more heat if you are charging phones in usb cable which is available in product my first phone was charge after that my second phone charge only my both phones have mah battery so i think if you chreg two phones continously its will become more heat the power bank take hours with w charger backup is average you can trust mi
409,2.0,very bulky and strap results in skin irritation
410,4.0,love this dress sadly it ran so large that it was literally falling off of me because i bought it on sale the option wasnt there to buy a smaller one the quality is excellent and its perfect for a spring or summer day in miami sorry to have had to return it due to the sizing issue

413,2.0,no comments
414,1.0,very bad experience with this iphone xr phone back camera found defective and non functional amazon is very careless i havent got any response on confirmation for replacing i am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than rupees
415,5.0,lovable product very use friendly
416,3.0,this product picture qailitynot bestbecause resulation power very worst
417,3.0,good quality but camera quality is not to good it takes pictures reddish and different from reality
418,1.0,terrible product one lippie for smelling great however i broke out all over my neck and behind my ears im talking big painful pimples i thought i was imagining this so i stopped using this for one month i used it again last week and bam broke out again needless to say it went in the garbage besides this did not provide anymore moisture to my hair than other brands
419,1.0,actually i bought iphone recently past days using my phone is getting over heated i dont understand this problem and cal volume too low sometimes not working
420,5.0,good product i liked very much thanks a lot
421,3.0,product is fine but service of transporter was very bad
422,5.0,tried this on in the store and fell in love its such a simple shirt but the details are special runs tts will get a lot of use out of this
423,3.0,i suggest just getting the standard echo or the larger ones they are louder pick up voices better and seem to function best overall
424,5.0,i picked this top hoping that it would go with the dipped horizon skirt and the color was a perfect match i love the irregularities in the dye and the woven back the cut is boxy but the fabric is soft and drapes well so very flattering looks great with white jeans
425,3.0,i really wanted to like this dress and was encouraged by the positive reviews the dress itself was very comfortable but was very unflattering the top fabric hit my ribs funny and made me look really wide
426,4.0,i loved the swimsuit when i saw it online and it looks just a cool in person however i had to return it because the size large top was very very small i wear a d bra this top seemed like it would only work for an a or b cup size even in the size large cute suit for the right body though
427,3.0,writing this review after days of usage cons bad battery only go for it if u are ready to charge times a day very less on screen timse that too without gaming and adaptive britghness on gestures not very effective should have been more camera average did not find it any better that one plus no adapter provided for mm jack off market one not comfortable to insert and remove gb already consumed by os pro screen feels rich to eyes and touch nice speed charges in one hour sound is exceptional dolby atmos conclusion not worth investing rs looks like one plus are milking thier brand now with less value to money for users
428,4.0,this sweater dress is so soft and great qualityyou can dress it up or down i will get a lot of use out of it
429,4.0,this phone is really super its camera quality is too good battery is awesome fingerprint screen quality face recognition is also good i will recommend others also to try this once
430,3.0,i bought this because i asked a friend of mine who always has such nice and shiny hair what she uses and this was it this stuff smells amazing and makes my hair super shiny and moisturized the only reason i dont love it is because this stuff gives me bacne if it touches my back and when i have it in my hair and then go to bed i get pimples on my cheeks and i never ever break out on my cheeks i still use it occasionally because i love what it does for my hair but i hate how i have to be so careful about not letting it touch my face or back i would probably rate this stars if it didnt break me out
431,5.0,bettery good camra very good
432,3.0,it has no battery backup so power should be given always thats is the bad thing good product
433,5.0,having a smart phone at such a reasonable price with such great features is like finding a ginnie with face unlock to fingers sensors to awesome camera quality great battery life and yes the speed of processor is not to be forgotten and the sleek look of the phone is the ice on the cake a smart buywithin such a great range one should consider buying it if you want to have your ginnie
434,3.0,good books for reader
435,1.0,i thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on it is so big on the bottom it looks like a tent i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big sad
436,4.0,review after one week of usage since i was always using ios since so shift was a bit trickywas a bit apprehensive about android and yes took a while getting used to this but phone on a whole is not giving me any reasons for regretting my discussion pros face unlock is superfast same is with fingerprint sensor built quality looks awesome it gives a feel while holding it comes with transparent back cover best part wasp charger is awesome very very good response in games like pubg nd finally i can also see people lying in grass which was a bit difficult in my iphone cons miss the stocks app of iphone camera is not that good means its ok types oneplus ringtone is nothing infront of default apple ringtone overall at this price its far better updrade then going for iphone it wins from iphone maybe loses from pro but its a value for money product go for it
437,3.0,it is great thats what i supposed to do like it a lot
438,4.0,the design of the power bank is very stylish but the battery life is not so good
439,5.0,when you first start using alexa shes a bit aggravating it gets better the dot has a weak speaker it is great for answering questions timers alarms and that kind of thing but it is not going to be your music or podcast center unless you add a speaker a speaker can be added by bluetooth but it is better to add the speaker using an auxiliary cable get multiple dots and put them in each room no matter where you are at you can listen to the morning news with just a voice command the drop in feature allows you to use it as a household intercom
440,4.0,overall is good but if you want a good battery life i will suggest please dont go for it
441,3.0,over all a good product but unable to use the option of voice search seems like system cannot catch our words please work on it
442,5.0,no chance for disliking this finest book
443,5.0,one of the best retailer pieces i have ever purchased high quality and fits true to size i have a large chest and this minimizes and creates a really nice silhouette i highly recommend got so many compliments i bought both colors
444,3.0,this works great my biggest complaint is that it ties to my sons kindle and we have been unable to remove it he is constantly running his battery down because of this also when alexa plays a song and you stay stop alexa it pauses and then resumes you have to ask it to stop or times before it stops
445,3.0,i loved the dog on this sweater and i rushed into the store to buy it once i tried it on like others i did find it to be itchy but that i could deal with using a tank or something what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut my arms looked much bigger than they are so sadly i left it at the store it really is a cute sweater though
446,3.0,glass broken bed to floor feet destancedevice too slowlike as gb ram my realme c is more faster than m
447,5.0,great phone in this pricedont worry about few bad commentsgo for it
448,3.0,the main reason i decided to use this shampoo was because it is sulfate free also because my hair is on the split ends side i decided quotwhy notquot lets see if it works well so far i like it but i do not love it it is a good shampoo and it will leave the hair very soft just after shampooing alone however i see that it does give me a lot of hair fall out every time i do use it that is why i felt like it did not deserve a rating of since this could be a big problem for some of us it is something about this organix products and i know is the products because i just started using this line and that is all ive been using still the shampoo does leave my hair very shiny and healthy looking plus it smells real good
449,3.0,i brought this phone days before st time review writing on online purchased product cause ive losses because no one write like my type issue really good mobile since awesome camera capture and battery life still ive losses my display from drop of feet from coffee table to floor even cloth matt floor not direct concrete ive feel bad that display crack and not working confirmed with customer care that this not cover under warranty price may cause around k plus to replace combo of touch and display really if you smooth user without drop time you can or elce wear some type of protectors to avoid losses this is from my heart to no let other to looses there hard earn money
450,3.0,i bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic but it was really huge on me i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large it was very long as well and i am tall i am normally a size to give you an idea i would recommend it but it is going back for me
451,5.0,i am so glad i tried this on last minute in my store it was on a tbale and saw it no hte stylist picks so decided why not try it on i thought i would need a petite but hte elngth of the regualr hit me almsot one inch above my knee which is a sweet spot for me petite may hit me too high to be able to pull ths casual style at work and i wear character shirts with jeans or joggers on the weekends so i ordered the for me the store had a stain on it i am lbs for referenc
452,2.0,well made dress but too much fabric for my taste it lays a little heavy on the body does not give a slimming affect the colors are vibrant pretty but the dress is too long as well as other reviewers have said the front is too low cut but turn it around and it looks feels better didnt work for me sadly ill be returning it
453,1.0,unfortunately this was not the least bit hydrating in fact it did quite the opposite after every wash my hair felt unusually dry and brittle i even tried prepooing with a hot oil treatment consisting of coconut and olive oil still dryim talking sahara desert dry it also made my scalp itch which is extremely rare for me the smell was its only redeeming quality boo
454,2.0,these run at least sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand mother such a bummer because the quality is totally on point im going to exchange them for a huge size i guess whatever i dont mind having a size thats so much larger than all my other jeans i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control its not retailers fault so annoyed
455,3.0,too much bass but treble and mids lost if yo want to listen all drum beats go for it if you want to listen little loader bass with all blues dont go for that
456,5.0,nice mobile in this price
457,4.0,its a decent phone but with sd its slightly laggy and not very fluid and the screen resolution is p so you wont get to view full hd quality content overall a decent phone at this price range
458,4.0,fingerprint reader is goodcamera is good but colors are bit reddish but nice some time i feel touch is but off or not responding as fast as i want may be i am wrong and everything is fine over all phone is good and best phone to buy at this price range game mode it good games are smooth
459,2.0,i loved the name of the product sounds so exotic as its beautiful smell however the product was too much like liquid for its packaging quality and so there was some excessive wastage firstly i have waste length hair that everyone comments on how beautiful and smooth it is because i am obsessed with its condition to the point i always wear a hat to protect it from the sun the product is good at protecting the hair shaft making it smooth and detangle however the oil in the product is hard to remove so i had to shampoo it quite a bit read damaging to remove it making my hair dry as you should not scrub the long lengths with a shampoo the worst in summer it make my hair so itchy and i started breaking out in dermatitis and flies love that coconut smell in summer as the heat starts making smell like vomit after a while so sad
460,1.0,on the rd day of using new laptop i noticed a vertical line on left side of the laptop screen this i noticed on changing the background picture to a blue coloured wallpaper from the default black coloured wallpaper which comes with the new laptop i tried replacing the laptop within the days return window but it has been now over days and i am yet to receive a written confirmation about replacement leave aside getting a replaced product i hope that the laptop is replaced soon and then i comment on the performance of the laptop
461,5.0,im tall lbs and and the size s fit me perfectly the hyphen chino is my favorite pant just stretchy enough just casual enough without being sloppy just nice enough to wear to work i bought both pinks and the moss the turquoise were too big in the waist for some reason but the color while gorgeous didnt work with the rest of my wardrobe
462,2.0,i am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered but i still dont think it would have worked the fabric is very soft but thats where its qualities for me ended the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips for reference im and hourglass dd the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it
463,3.0,touch is not good other wise good
464,5.0,compact handy lightweight performance good
465,5.0,i am using this phone from last months it is very good mid range phone from honor i like this phone but camera quality is average may be they fix it from software updates
466,1.0,bad clarity didnt thought mi does for us no screen mirroring many more
467,2.0,worst camera leave about mp after looking at the picsin mobile not pclaptop you will feel like pictures were taken from some kind of mp or ageold mp camera the battery is good but not up to the mark for mah you would expect it to last for minimum days at least with basic usageno moviesgamesheavy browsing etc like calls and checking notifications messaging etc it lasted for just hours for me with basic usage charging time was around hrs wifi coverage is also limited it doesnt connect if i am in different room which was not the case with real me and one plus phone the only best thing is the display i think this mobile has got the best display under k range if your only priority is display then nothing can beat this mobile under k and the worst part is that there is no replacement for this mobile only refund i believe replacement was not given considering the additional cashback which will be credited to the seller if they refund the amount not sure though seller stpl exclusive online
468,3.0,im lbs and bought a size i loved this dress but didnt expect to have to go braless or wear a tube top under the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely i ordered a size

471,4.0,this has really reduced the number of split ends i have after washing my hair i pump the product into my hands rub my hands together then smooth it down the lower half of my hair its inexpensive too
472,4.0,overall a super comfy dress that you can wear anywhere short petite ladies beware though the dress does not hang at your natural waist like it shows in the models photos in order for me to have it sit at my waist the dress was folded over and did not flatter
473,5.0,i got my wife a samsung galaxy tab for christmas and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do once she did that led of course to her wanting to watch movies on it that was my signal to spring into action that is if i wanted to prevent her from running wild buying digital copies of every movie we already have in dvd or bluray you cant play dvd or bluray movies on this device but you can use your computers dvd or bluray drive and commonplace thirdparty software to convert movies in this format into mp andor several other types of video files that can be played on this tabletsince this particular tablet is capable of playing highdefinition video screen resolution is x pixels and we want to use all of that highdef capability my conversion files tend to be pretty large average to gb per movie way too big to be stored on the tablets limited internal memory thats where the tablets microsd slot and this sandisk flash memory comes in i make huge mps store them separately on a terabyte drive and then load as many of them as i can on this chip which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card and hit play you can use the devices standard video player or get an app with more controlswatching highdef video on a tablet thats streaming the data from a memory card rather than the tablets internal memory requires a memory card with very high read speed and this sandisk cards class rating fills that bill thats the difference between cheaper microsd thats primarily designed for simple data storage and microsd thats designed for higher active transferread speeds the class designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a minimum rate of mb per second this sandisk ultra card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to mb per second depending on the speed of the device youre using it in and other particulars of the way youre using the devicefrustration free packaging means the chip sd adapter and plastic case comes in a little sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener this card comes preformatted for android and my use of it in the galaxy tab for watching highdef mp movies has thus far been flawlessfinally dont let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck while pricing on memory tends to fluctuate amazons current pricing on this card is very competitive with anyall vendors out there selling genuine sandisk ultra memory buy from amazon or other trustworthy vendor because i just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers that is the counterfeiters are placing sandisk labelingpackaging on inferior generic microsd and selling the bogus chips on ebay and anywhere else they can i bought three from amazon after i got burned by a chinese seller on ebay the counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me until i actually tried one of the chips in the galaxy tab the write speed that is the amount of time it takes to transfer files onto the microsd card was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine sandisk ultra card and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the galaxy tab i may never have figured it out at all if i didnt already have one other genuine sandisk ultra with which to compare the fakesif you want the best most reliable memory for the microsd slot on your shiny new android device look no further this is it

484,4.0,very useful technically powerful handset
485,3.0,the main problem with alexa is that unlike a human companion alexa does not seem to understand that humans are creatures with habits thus every morning at am i have to say alexa play wamu from tunein if i forget the from tunein she plays a random pop station from iheart radio and i never listen to pop radio and of course i can just forget saying alexa wamu i am so sick of saying thisi especially dislike the routine i have to go through to get her to play the book i am currently listening to on audible if i just say alexa play swanns way from audible she will claim i do not have the book even though looking at what she puts on the app regarding what she heard she clearly correctly transcribed what i said so to get her to play my book i have to first ask her what books i have on audible then ask her if i have swanns way on audible then if i ask her to play swanns way on audible she plays it now swanns way is a very long book so we have been going through this routine every time i want to listen for many months now she seems to have no idea that the book i am currently reading on audible is swanns way this would be a very easy thing to code i do not know why the alexa authors have not done thisif you send a mail to customer help about this you will get a long obsequious response like the one eric idle does when playing a waiter who has received a complaint about a dirty spoon in monte python and then a pointer to a completely irrelevant long document i dont think they even read what you write before doing this
486,2.0,i was so disappointed with the quality of this dress especially because it looks so beautiful on the model the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash its already developing a tiny hole and pilling also it is definitely not a day dressi wore it as a swim coverup but it is much too thin and pajamalike to be worn as an actual dress the color is much different in personthe blue is brighter and for lack of a better way to describe it cheap looking the white banding around the t

496,4.0,good phone battery very good
497,3.0,just a status symbol some features are good but not satisfied not worth
498,2.0,the reason i bought this is i had its big brother mah version you can read my review of it on the product and it was not working well but the smaller version is facing similar problems but i cannot return it now as i have crossed the return date pros lighter and easier to carry than the mah version good premium finish charges devices pretty fast cons it will discharge heavily on its own without you using it to charge any of your device i can understand that the power bank loses its charge if not used for long but i am talking about daily charging and recharging sometimes you have to plug and unplug equivalent of turning your computer onoff for it to start recharging your device its advertised as mah but it doesnt really do charging cycles of a mah device it does maybe i will not recommend this power bank unless you have no other reliable option in this price point
499,1.0,fake produvt
500,2.0,love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric for the first few wearings i was in love then it began to pill horribly would not recommend my mother said thats going to pill up and i ignored her and she was right
501,3.0,took another reviewers advice and sized up to an xl unfortunately it grabbed around my midsection and wasnt attractive love the color and its dreamy soft the sleeves are attractive on less than toned arms my problem was with the side view which emphasized my tummy it clings and you could see a lot of my bra because in the larger size the armholes are large sadly returned

512,3.0,a battery hog i didnt get a lot of battery life after doing what all you would be doing with your high end device true battery life depends on a persons screen time but just imagine after paying so much and all this ios app optimization still device gets heated and battery gets drained very quickly while playing cod fps oneplus a different league android and oxygen os offers a lot better performance battery drain also happens whole running youtube app even on safari watch hd videos and you will see drop per minute if not more putting this all into perspective this isnt an ergonomic device for someone who has a lot of expectations from a budget iphone lol i m using the term budget seems ironic secondly the viewing experience in a k worth device matters the most whats good if you have so nice hardware but the display is not so nice here i wud like to say that this devices display was a bummer coming from iphone x i was totally disappointed that you are paying k but not getting a proper oled display its all but lcd retina they call it totally crap the contrast is too poor to call it a premium display coz even midrange displays give you a better experience a sucks sds are topping the charts lastly should you buy it ffs no xr depreciated k first time in history of iphones a device has seen so much depreciation in the first year itself so think twice the display and overall performance seemed at par with most budget mid range devices but if you are only cared about the notch and apple logo go for it blindly and maybe regret later
513,4.0,my stylist didnt love them they are well made the waist line is comfortable and the embroidery is very pretty the hem is loosefitting perhaps that is what she thought was not as flattering the material is airy nice for summer i think you should give these a try for me perhaps it is my muscular legs that made her hesitate
514,3.0,the echo dot arrived and i got to work setting it up the dot connected to my wifi and downloaded an update this unit was destined for the samsung bedroom tv to work along with a harmony remote hub that i have had for a while all software was up to date since the harmony was already set up and working perfectly all i had to do is to download the alexa app to my iphone and install the harmony skill set with the blue logo assign some friendly names and finally tell alexa to discover devices it all went very smoothlynow for the test i told alexa to turn on the tv and she said ok nothing happened after checking that i did all the setup steps correctly i used the remote to turn the tv on and off then i told alexa to turn the tv on she said ok and this time it worked i then told her to change the channel and she said ok and then the channel changed i told her to turn off tv and she did it seems to me that the harmony hub must be awakened before it can execute alexas commandsafter a few hours i tried again and the same problem alexa said ok but the tv did not turn on etc maybe a future update from harmony or amazon will solve the problem when it works its much easier to have alexa execute commands instead of using the remote if i discover a solution or there is an update that corrects the problem i will update my reviewps using the dot in the bedroom means having the light on all the time there should be a way to turn it off
515,4.0,i was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine appeal while the material was not v

535,2.0,i am a big fan of the organix ever straight brazilian keratin therapy conditioner so when i began hunting for the perfect shampoo this caught my interest it is sulfate free after all and has several beneficial ingredients for damaged hair howeverthis shampoo feels harsh on my hair its very stripping i went days without washing my naturally oily scalp and it left my hair very very dry at the roots i even followed up with a deep conditioning mask tonight thinking the outcome would be different nope my hair is very frizzy and dry at the moment the search for a moisturizing shampoo goes on

541,4.0,this is a beautiful dress the color is really great and i love the cut flattering around the neckline and loose and flowy the one downside is that it is pretty long i am and usually somewhere between and xs and s for dresses so went with the xs the size is great but its just a tad long for wearing with flats i actually think if i was bustier the length would be fine but since im pretty flat theres nothing to fill the dress i wish i had been able to snag a petite but they w

543,1.0,camara qualitybbad
544,1.0,it was very terrible order
545,3.0,all aspects of the phone are mostly good especially the camera however i had a lot of issues with the call quality with signal strength on sims i still had issues with calls from within my home as the person at the other end could not hear me at all i always had to go out of my house to have a conversation as much as i liked the phone i had to return it due to the persistent issue with the most basic and important feature of the phone
546,2.0,very slow mobil
547,5.0,really wonderful product and very much liked it i would strongly advise to buy a zoook rokcet m product as bluetooth speaker comes with in features like bt sd card usb fm aux pros stylish look sound is loud and clear without any noise very great coverage bt mode fm is working properly excellent in features extremely affordable pricing nice on off controls and other options accessories like charging cable aux cable shoulder strapsd card adapter comes with this unit at a free cost nice onoff volume controls and etc i personal say no cons on this product at extremely affordable pricing
548,4.0,the power bank worked fine for the first charging considering my phone is k mah it should get charged fully at least twice but it doesnt the power bank drains way too quickly and its only been a week since i bought it
549,1.0,phone is getting hang in just using days phone is completely defective
550,5.0,it slips on easily is soft flattering it will definitely be my go to dress
551,4.0,phone is good but battery draining too fast heating issue is major drawback but after days of use i think it is the best phone in this range heating issues are almost in control
552,3.0,i ordered the red versionit is incredibly cute soft vibrant and a flattering aline however this dress is sized oddly running at least one or two sizes too small particularly at the waistband i ordered my usual size and one size up and even the larger size was too snug in the waist yet at the same time i had some gaping at the straps and i have a full bust even worse is the impossible sidezipper that is a workout to get past the seam at the waistband trying to wrestle the zip
553,2.0,like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short im only xs and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model also the quality isnt great as its very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front its a shame bc the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique sadly its going back
554,3.0,bought it for my dad it works pretty decent considering the fact that its a xiaomi product im usually pretty skeptical about such brands but it gets the job done i guess
555,3.0,bought this tv from sony showroom while looking at the display it seemed fine amazing hdr color display everything seem pitch perfect after delivery while watching movies in a dark room tv seemed very disbalanced with backlight black seem grey and washed especially in those hdr scene display looks poor in light display looks awesome if youre more of a dark room person strictly avoid this tv for ps quality is average again not a tv for gamers android seem laggy very laggy at times better to use firestick or other connectivity movies without hdr still looks fine in a dark room better go for series if youve money or look elsewhere
556,1.0,dont buy i have buy on february after one month problem coming like soundssecurity locks also bad
557,2.0,i used this with the coordinating shampoo and i liked the shampoo but not this conditioner while i liked the smell and the thicker consistency of the shampoo i disliked the smell and the thin consistency of this conditioner the smell was fake and i usually need a bit of a thicker conditioner if i want to have any hope to reduce the static and frizz that comes with my fine hair and dry climate i will continue to use up this shampoo and conditioner but once i finish it i will not repurchase
558,3.0,camera quality of the phone is poor and its fingerprint sensor doesnt work well it unlocks phone on any finger not so good phone its a poor quality phone as per my experience mi phones are way betterits screen attracts a lot of dust
559,1.0,bought a week back so difficult to install very poor manual doesnt turn on who can we reach out to help
560,3.0,it has a hardware failure after a month of use luckily was in warranty and apple replaced the phone
561,5.0,any dislikes
562,3.0,good for watching movies and series but bass is not that great for music listening as compared to wired boat earphones so for music lovers and bass lover go for other brand because this one is just ok
563,2.0,i purchased this top in the black and tan color loved the fit style and fabric however it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front which could not be repaired it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden i was very disappointed in the quality of this top i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once i just didnt have the time to return it to the store
564,2.0,contacted shinko customer care denied replacement only offered repair only option left for me is return the product to amazon happy to give another try if either amazon or shinko replaces the product with a new one
565,5.0,go for it best in class camera and bttry and super amoled display wil take u the nxt level
566,4.0,working well so far looks good and has all latest features available nothing exceptional

572,5.0,sound quality is not that great use it with my blue tooth speaker most the time the range on the blue tooth is very impressive we took it to mexico and it worked great with our smaller blue tooth speaker
573,2.0,didnt work on this curvy gal sizing up would have helped with the button gaps but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size major pass
574,5.0,title think and grow rich author napoleon hill publisher amazing reads genre selfhelp nonfiction my rating my review i dont think this book needs a review because its a bestseller for over years with millions of copies sold but still i wanna talk about this book because i feel many people are still unaware of this beauty guys if you are a dreamer and you want to be successful in your life i know you always need a push or motivation to continue on that path with the same dedication strength and not giving up attitude this book can help you a lot because it has great examples motivational stories principlessecrets to success and also many practical ideas which if followed properly you can do wonders as i always say a book wont work unless you do if you want this book to help you then you have to apply all those principles
575,3.0,this top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it also the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt still the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans
576,3.0,the book is a nice read
577,2.0,i really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality but the shape is impossible to work with it doesnt just run big it just hangs there really disappointing itll have to go back
578,5.0,excellent camera quality selfie pics are excellent
579,2.0,dislike
580,5.0,i was little bit confused before buying this tv but decided to try new brand this smart tv is excellent in this range for picture quality and other functions fully satisfied with this product
581,5.0,worth the i spent here then buying it at the store for use it for the galaxy note and the galaxy note
582,3.0,this was too big in the arms i didnt like how there was only one button toward the top so that it made your body look hippy little too itchy too best thing about it was the look of the slouchy collar
583,2.0,sound is not what was expected
584,1.0,dear folks all those who purchased this mobile will definitely regret in future it doesnt up to what you think that would be best mobile in this price range and moreover a baby of samsung i purchased this mobile one week back amazon great indin festival after three days screen was blank i cant see anything till now but phone is working i do feel that im blind whenever i seen at my mobile screen patheticrip samsung
585,1.0,poor quality its take days for mobile charging while other small cable is taking max hours total waste of money
586,1.0,worst apple phone hanging like samsung phone
587,4.0,its a cool product it has a gorgeous display let me get the cons out of the way first i have been a motorola user and never liked softened photos on other phones this ms is notorious for softening out the details when using the front cam i didnt find any option to remove this and stuff so i would be waiting for a gcam mod to arrive apart from the camera the phone feels nice in hand somehow its camera adjusts every time i close it giving off a sound somewhat similar to the s i have to get it checked once whether the sound is expected or not the phone does feel good in hand apart from a slight creak that i hear because of some plastics not getting together properly charging speed is not so great but it will suffice as it does have a good battery games are good and i had to replace the stock launcher coz i wanted to customize and samsung store was expecting me to pay money for icon packs and themes not cool samsung dark theme is good there is a screen recording feature but that just works for games thats bad i installed nova launcher and used the lines free icon pack and its been simply awesome waiting for a case as the back can get easily scratched up please use a matt finish while making polycarbonate backsplease samsung also all other mobile companies i would like to feel confident while carrying it without worrying of scratches bluetooth range is good mobile data reception is good the display panel makes you feel that your phone is no less than a premium phone while using in amazon prime i always had the issue of the video not going till the edgesnotch part samsung got a nice fix for it in the settings you can actually force an app to use the screen till the edges thats a nice tweak i wish samsung offered free customization options in their store or at least allow downloaded fonts to be used that would let so many users not download third party launchers just like myself it doesnt feel heavy in hand though touted mah it does ensure a minimum of mah it has the device optimizer and some stuff inbuilt a very good thing is that you can actually uninstall most of the preloaded apps except a couple of apps including netflix and galaxy store please change the camera algorithm samsung it feels so touched up and thats all folks i believe its worth it
588,4.0,it takes long time and has issue with detecting finger print
589,5.0,to tell abt honor band i must really appreciate the accuracybut the only thing i was not satisfied was the battery lifeother than that every other options are very good
590,5.0,book is great and amazon service is good as well
591,4.0,i love the look of this tee casual but with some interesting details that make it more flattering and wearable than a plain tee i tried on my regular size xs and it was large and frumpy so i was initial disappointed however when it was on promo i decided to try the xxs and it made a huge difference if you size down it is great and looks like it does on the model i ordered the coral and it is a beautiful color the dye seems to be uneven as it is darker in some parts for this reason i
592,5.0,seriuosly why didnt i get this before i love it use it every morning for weather updates and play music happy with my buy
593,3.0,yes this top is not of the best quality but i bought it on sale with an additional off it has a very cute design on the back and will be cute on while running errands on a hot day its true to size im lbs and m fit well
594,4.0,i really like this pullover the design is beautiful and i love the asymmetrical hem my own complaint is that the fit is a bit boxy on me because im largechested its more drapey than tailored but its not overwhelming and doesnt cancel out how much i like it overall
595,1.0,does not say ribbed did not want ribbed would not have bought ribbed
596,1.0,only battery are best fail processor fail camera dont buy plastic design lo quality dust leak in camera side because of low quality plz dont buy
597,4.0,its a great device from samsung overall it offers great performance let me write the pros and cons pros really long battery lifemah so it ensures nonstop gaming and entertainment amazing display since it comes with the samoled display its gives those nice viewing angles punchy colors in a video the processor being powered by exynos soc it ensures high end gaming for exampleit supports extreme frame rate on pubg mobile and it truly works on those settings without any major lags fingerprint scanner its decent the good thing is that it works even if you have slight moisture on your fingers camera pretty decent camera i really liked the wide angle lens and it works even in video mode but i feel the primary camera sensor needs some improvement i hope samsung improves its quality via ota updates cons heats up quickly while gaming however reducing the graphics and frame rate helps solving the issue no notification led lack of customizations in the ui however the notification panel has some amazing quick toggles which i found to be really usefull primary camera sensor needs improvement face unlock is little slow
598,3.0,when we call some one so bluetooth is stable connected but whenever we recevd call from another person the connectivity is auto setup over phone bluetooth is disable automaticlly so we had to setup manually fucntion not good for bikers and car drivers
599,1.0,display brightness is very poor in day light you cannot see the timing its not at all visible
600,2.0,unfortunately my dot has died after only six months and will no longer power on the warranty is only days so it isnt covered when it was used it was primarily as a timer or to play music there are far too many junk apps to wade through to find much useful i dont anticipate replacing it at this time
601,2.0,andrid one is veri difical to understanding
602,5.0,i bought this once at the time i was going through a quotcoconutquot phase lol it smells amazing and fresh it has great foaming texture feels clean and the bottle looks nice i would definitely buy it again butthe prices for this brand are pricey not bad but most of them have great scents guess i cant complain
603,1.0,pls dont buy this phone totally waste of money i bought this on oct amazn delivered a defective phone wifi nd bluthooth not turning on phone hangs fingerprint se slow like hell and amazon service for returning is pathatic pls dont waste ur money
604,4.0,i purchased the mobile on th september i think samsung finally listen to their customers and brought very competetive mobile in its class i have been using the mobile gb gb for almost days now here are the things i observed one ui seems lighter and simpler than other uis like mi ui coloros i observed no lags so far i really like one ui good things super amoled screen colors are punchy viewing angles are great back camera mp takes really good pictures turn on scene optimizer for even better pictures one ui simple light and fast battery it is huge and samsung sw optimization make it even better i am getting sot of hrs to hrs form factor it is great in hand and didnt feel heavy sound qualitydolby atmos via headphones not so good things build quality it is average i can hear tiny sound when i touch side of the phone front mp camera is very average and takes soft pics like mp signal reception is also average you will get bar less signal compared to other phones in competition back wide angle camera mp taking images when fish eye effect hope it can be fixed techy and gaming things gaming i m not a hard core gamer pubg and wwc ran fine better than redmi note pro gcam cameraapi support is limited only the current gcam ports are not fully working hope samsung enables it to make us tinker around with gcam ports in future my opinion if you watch lot of online content like youtube amazon prime etc and doesnt bother about issues i mentioned above go for it
605,4.0,battery life low not to good as compared to asus no facility of quick charging available in huawei y

608,2.0,purchased on th september but the phone automatically lost the network on both my sim on the th day got it repaired at the samsung service center at mumbai cst which was a harrowing experience but they didnt replace my phone as it got defective on the th day of my purchase and they have replacement policy only upto days from the date of purchase i have lost trust on the brand and i feel it has the worst service centers in the mobile industry

611,4.0,i love the weight and drape of this vest it adds a finished touch to even the simplest t shirts i plan on wearing it into the cooler months of fall however it runs a week bit small across the bust i normally wear a medium at retailer but large would have been a better fit sadly the large vest in the dark blue was sold out
612,3.0,bill quality super mobil luck super battery life good photos and video s average
613,1.0,the processor of the phone is not prefer the lite applications and battery is not removeable so i am waiting for battery discharge then after my phone is restart so the phone is unlucky for me

633,3.0,oh wow no as the previous reviewer said much lighter than the picture rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this something maybe for a younger audience who like the s retro vibe the fit is true to size i tried the and it was a nice snug fit around the bum waist hips usually a or in jeans sometimes even a if theyre super skinny
634,2.0,i found this laptop after a lot of researching all i have wanted a decent laptop for day to day ms office work and light in weight for my sister in terms of specification it was so cool but the laptop does not work as per the given specs the booting time is near min which is super annoying i am not a computer pro but how can a core i processor takes min for booting after booting it takes another min to work properly recently the battery drainage problem is significant i dont know what should i do know
635,5.0,this will be a season dress for me its well made comfy and flattering the suede skirt is risky i know but ill be sure to put the napkin in my lap
636,2.0,i just got this in the mail the other day i was really excited and then crushed one buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling it looked old and i wore it about hours i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back too bad but not what i bought and then not

640,5.0,absolutely love this jacketinitially wanted to buy the melita draped jacket which looks similar to this one and tried them both on in store the latter just didnt drape properly and looked more like a bathrobe on me but this piece is amazing it falls nicely and the pockets jut out a bit giving it a unique look the fabric is fluid and soft and it has a tie waist with another tie in the back of the jacketmiddle bottom which is a bit of an added but subtle flair the color is a bit more t
641,1.0,band stopped working after days
642,2.0,dislike because quality is not good i tried to return nokia plus mobile phone but amazon saying the electronic items are not returnable please purchase through other online shopping like flipkart snapdeal etc dont purchase through amazon if you are interested to purchasebuy any electronic items like mobile phone laptop etc please go for other shopping site like flipkart not purchase through amazon i am unappy because i selected the amazon online shopping and purchase a mobile phone of nokia plus gb ram but i dont like this mobile phone be cause it is small in size front camera photo quality is not good in night time or in low light time the rear camera is also like same one more things when you are taking picture in room the photo quality is not coming good as per mentioned mega pixel camera when you take the photo outside the picture quality is really good the mobile is hitting to much when you compare with other mobiles like samsung vivo oppo
643,3.0,no option of using other accounts like google for contact details is a drawback not seen in other mobiles like note note etc only mi cloud is the option to store our contacts within a limited no
644,1.0,im normally a small in retailer tops i ordered a small and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper more fitted part it all went horribly wrong from there the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent instantly adding a good pounds to my frame this was such a disappointment as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality
645,4.0,love the draping on this top covers the stomach area and looks great on curvy girls i am between sizes and ended up purchasing the m fits well i chose the mauve which is more of a light graypurple
646,4.0,i purchased this top in both colors while on sale it fits true to size the material is heavier than i expected but that just means it should hold up for a long time recommend

648,5.0,low budget excellent refrigerator
649,4.0,good laptop though a bit too large to carrythe topmost keys on the keyboard are small and given the fact that the keyboard has lots of space they could have easily put larger size keys the cover of the laptop tends to show the fingerprint marks and smudges ms office is the student version and doesnt have all features except these negatives i found the laptop fairly good for routine work purpose
650,3.0,its been just a month i have bought this phone there is dust inside the camera lens kindly look into the matter get it corrected

658,2.0,pretty shirt on the hanger but theres a goof in the design when i tried it on my d self there became this weird ruffle right besidebelow the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo now that i know its there the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and its not flattering and im just a b
659,1.0,i do not receive headphones
660,4.0,this dress is absolutely beautiful and had it been just a little longer or a little shorter i would have kept it but the hem hit me at just the wrong spot alas i had to send it back
661,2.0,this shampoo made my scalp itchy and break out after a couple uses i didnt notice too much of a difference in my hair either just that it now smelled like pink sugar i dont recommend it
662,2.0,battery life is really low without too much of applications software is hanging terribly too much was not expected but the basic requirements were not met
663,5.0,it is a fantastic product using continous without any hazard hardy easy to carry charging backup satisfactory recommend to buy

667,4.0,it vary good refrigerator
668,4.0,i still havent cover of the book but one of my befriend told me this is a good one so ill say definitely buy it if it is under rupees charges included
669,4.0,i purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip it is very pretty without being overly frilly a marled heather grey color soft and warm without being too bulky light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress it is a roomy fit without being sloppy i like things a bit loose and comfy not too tight and am happy with the medium
670,2.0,only within a month of purchase tv is geting hanged frequently got shut down with a cracking voice twice now my running around the customer care will start hope the oderal stops in only one visti of technician else it will be night mare for the warranty period and will have to again spen for another tv very disappointed
671,4.0,here is my review after getting ms the design surprise me i thought its gonna be bulky but looks premium set up all the apps and update as well super amoled full hd is the best display under one ui is top notch battery is good enought but expect more from mah performance meets expectations rear camera is good but not monster phone automatically heats up while i was sleeping and drains battery dear samsung please fix this photo attached is night mode shot
672,3.0,doesnt answer simple questions and when i manually try to turn the volume up she turns off i think my expectations were to high
673,1.0,i received defective item the phone will be auto offwhen display light off then the ph was totaly off every timei used only one day
674,1.0,i recieved the defective product twice for the same
675,4.0,for the price you pay it is very good software is super buggy and very user unfriendly the remote too is not very good and wifi reciever too does not support ghz band but add in an amazon firetv stick and suddenly this tv becomes a real vfm product this tv is not dumb but cant call it smart either someone just put together some sw kind of smart tv many places you feel like just giving up on its smartness i did and thankfully had a spare firetv stick since my other tv is actually smart and didnt need it
676,5.0,i bought this to add storage to my gb gs which only ended up having around gb on arrival the transfer speeds are great i was able to copy my entire music library over in minutes

678,5.0,ms builted with strong ergonomic design and body shape attractively catches everyone eyescoming to phone performance camera fired with impeccable features like wide angle photography and short angle pleasant picturesto make it work all the applications with smoother use ability ms synergied with high speed processing chips it is worth taking to the edge for the quality hand on experimence im overwhelmed to get all the features at very economic price
679,1.0,i purchase samsung m after open box and no mobile in this box demo phone in given by amazaon
680,3.0,first of all this top runs big im and there was still plenty of room to spare in an extra small this is a cute top but i returned it because it was too stiff and boxy for me the fabric is thicker than your average tee and theres not much give so it may not hang well on all body types i might revisit it if it goes on sale because i like the design with the small details at the sides but this was an easy pass for me at the regular price
681,3.0,there are just too many things alexa doesnt know
682,4.0,once i saw this trench coat i thought it was so cute im usually a small in retailer tops but can be a little broad so i decided to go with the medium based on other reviews when i received the coat it was a little tight in the shoulders but still doable i was surprised how thin it was just a single sheet of cloth and how full the skirt bottom was however there is a cute light blue seem lining inside overall this trench coat is not really a warm coat but more of a fun piece to dress u
683,5.0,its an awesome buy but dont know why getting less battery life than the one that my friend is using
684,1.0,this is so thin and poor quality especially for the price it felt like a thin pajama top the buttons are terrible little shell buttons this could not have been returned faster
685,3.0,after usage of days overall it is an ok phonebut there are lots of issues with the fingerprint sensor not working sometimessometimes the phone response is very slowoverall i feel that at this price samsung should have provided a more stable phonesoftware but other than those issues the positives are the display battery backup is pretty good camera is pretty good
686,1.0,data network fluctuations throughout daytime when data connection switch off for hr during daytime or at night later again switch on but g connection or data is not getting connected unless it is restarted this issue i faced with different mi a mobile when i purchased in first week of nov i faced this issue so i replaced it new mia received in rd week of nov but same issues i faced this time amazon return my money so dont go with mia specially jio user

693,4.0,overall good
694,1.0,sounf quality not gud
695,1.0,not a good one if i have to say it one line there are technical issues which the company has ignored it will be foolish to gift
696,4.0,i have been using iphone samsung galaxy s s galaxy note and honor i using ms for last days i just want to put my experience here to help others for a better buying decision not to create bias pros screen honestly only one thing is good in this phone as is in other samsung phones as well its screen really good even though screen size is the screen to body ratio is perfect and doesnt feel odd while holding it with good weight distribution battery is ok but please dont think with mah it can last for full days before next charging is required only to days max with moderate to low use respectively other phones with similar specs are giving same backup with even mah battery but i have not faced any heating issue so far while chargingplaying games connectivity i have not found any issue in network wifi bluetooth fingerprint scanner i am not using jio network fingerprint scanner position is little difficult to find in the starting and with phone cover it is easy to use cons camera both back and front are the worst i have seen in any of the phones i have used or seen with my friends even a mi phone with mp camera produces better and sharp photos there is no sharpness no depth slow focus in the ms camera photos results are bad in low light if your priority is camera please do not purchase this phone better go for honormi for the same range you will get much much better camera results software one ui is ok but is feels slow even with gb ram which is strange as honor i is faster even with gb ram stock phone message camera file manager apps are really basic which you use on daily basis samsung should improve these app at least as these are the one to be used on day to day basis honor apps are much batter eg stock message app in i filters out personal and promotional messages in different tabs hence it is easy to find important messages multitasking etc is difficult in ms due to strange recent apps window feature which is not similar to other samsung phones like s etc also out of gb ram around gb ram is available which is by the way enough for playing any game multitasking etc but still its less compare to other phones also not sure why they have not included ultrapower save option in this phone which is readily available in all mi honor phones speaker again mediocre quality dolby atoms is again gimmicks honor i produced better sound with earphone fiio fh sony xbap sony xm samsung you should at least improve the quality of these basic things even a phone sounds better than yours over all build quality of phone is just ok you have better build quality phone in same range samsung could have tried for a little better quality sim tray side buttons fingerprint scanner and at least sweat resistant body also they should include the tempered glass and basic back cover to start with samsung you should not copy the gimmicks of other phone companies to provide the specs of mp camera gb ram mah battery etc just for the sake of it please provide a mp or even mp camera with better results better software management so gb ram and mah is optimized with less memory leak or battery drainage at the end of the day your sales will be good in first days of launch and once the reviews come out it will crash so no point of gimmicks only the early buyers may feel cheated who will anyway buy from other brands next time people are not looking for a phone just for a good screen but in this range they expect at least average quality speaker sound camera as well please focus on the overall quality instead of putting so much amount in marketing
697,4.0,nice book for competitive exams
698,4.0,this is such an ethereal flowing dressmore gray than light blue as it appears in pixlove the flowy bell sleevesits a modest length just above the kneequality a bit lower than is the retailer norm but still good
699,3.0,its a pretty cheap card and has a good amount of storage but it has fairly slow write performance some competitors microsd cards offer much faster performance for similar prices
700,2.0,weird fit and the tie just add to the problems i think id like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie the tie seems like an after thought its flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house no matter there size i ordered a medium black and its already in the mail
701,1.0,i am not happy with the product as i am facing issue didnt get any good response from amazon

704,3.0,i was very excited when i received it but i was needing it to play music throughout the day when i wasnt home for my dog so it wouldnt feel so lonely in the morning before i leave i ask alexa to play amazon music which she does but when i get home in the evening its offnothing playing so i am disappointed with that its great to ask her questions as the weather time etc but what i really wanted was for her to play music while i was gone

707,2.0,i had wanted to try organix and the bright pink packaging of this shampoo caught my eye i have used acai products before for my skin for example but never for my hair the shampoo is a very pulpy texture nearly translucent but does not feel terribly moisturous when applied all in all when paired with the conditioner i was not really very impressed
708,5.0,must read for everyone
709,4.0,lovely crochet lace tunic also very comfortable doesnt wrinkle and the cotton has a lovely feel
710,5.0,if you are looking for a good sd card look no further i use this in my samsung player and it works great you can pop it in and out of multiple players if you want to give you flexibility also priced very good compared to other places
711,4.0,im a sucker for anything in rich velvet tones and fabric the retailer i visited only had the dark blue top it is tts and hangs nicely on the body even for gals with longer backs there was no issue of seethrough with the blue hopefully the pink is the same due to the dark color and thicker material the sides are a tad seethrough but only at the cap sleeves the rest is well lined my only complaint is the vcut at the chest its entirely too low for my liking every t
712,3.0,its little average and some bugs about network i used red mi and mi max so its not reched that bench mark main issue is network i am getting less signals even my idea sim is notworking it works few seconds then it became mute but not cut from call and which works in other mobiles have to clear low network signal because which reached in other mobiles
713,2.0,my hair usually responds really well to vitamin e which is why i spent a bit of time deciding whether i should give this a go as i find organix products a bit hit and miss i had seen good reviews on the internet for this so i thought it would probably be okay well it was just kind of weird i didnt really get any moisture from it and it just made my hair feel stiff like id lightly sprayed my hair with hair spray like my fingers would get stuck when i ran them through my hair so it didnt really do anything terrible to my hair but im not someone who uses hair spray so i didnt like the feel and was looking forward to washing it out kind of wish i didnt waste my money
714,4.0,battery backup is bad and its take more time to get charged
715,5.0,handsdown one of the more comfortable shirts ive purchased from retailer
716,4.0,very good product for price if you want to switch to good smartphone them this is best choice
717,1.0,this product is totally wasteful the quality of sound and pictures totally unacceptable whatever they show in app is not matchale showing one product and sending one productand the way the mi and amazon customers service is totally unfriendly and the customer executives are arrogant my opinion is dont purchase products from mi and amazon
718,3.0,i wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes not worth the price poorly made you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin the shirt looks better int he picture i like it but it wears terribly

726,4.0,okgoodproductdont compare with high budget televisions
727,4.0,its a nice product though the battery life is not up to the mark and the camera is deteriorated after years from its release the processor is super fast till date a very good device for normal user but not for media consumption and gamers for poor battery life small screen low resolution screen will degrade the experience
728,3.0,purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on when i got home i retried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right i took them back and tried them in the next size they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online
729,5.0,service from amazon and sanyo was super promptloved my productpicture quality and sound isnt that great but its the best in this price rangeyou tube works like a miracle
730,1.0,pls dont buy this phone if you are going to buy this then pls go to the shop and chek the camera quality of this phone and then choose very poor quality of this camera i have been cheated by samsung in favour of camera i have used oppo a it was my big mistake exchange this phone with samsung
731,4.0,when it comes to motivational books its always among the top alchemist comes with an easy language and straightforward description i know people who hate reading long descriptions about each and every scene and if you are one of them then you are going to love this book it is a story about a shepherd young boy who chose a different path for his life irrespective of his parents interferencethe story surrounds around this boy who followed his intuitions and walked the path of his dreams it will lead you to a journey of dreams where there is love lots of teachings and offcourse the alchemist i am not going to describe its full summary here as something should be left for the audienceoverall its a must have for your books collection
732,5.0,very quick deliver by amazon as i accepted and the quality of on screen finger print is too good camara quality also nice battery is mah so its good but there are one thing that all buyers well know that the scree is only hd not fhd so if you want too much pixel density than think before but there are amoled design for screen so the color are bright otherwise everything is good and priceing is fair for gb verient
733,3.0,this blazer is a nice weight for summer it is more terracotta than rose but is still a nice color the fit is tts and flattering however the buttons were almost falling off the one i received i didnt take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it

738,3.0,good mobile in this price
739,3.0,the smallest size xs was big on me i was overwhelmed by the sweater it is a bit of swing shape doesnt hug the body sleeves are interesting though but not flattering on a petite frame color is a pretty green made me think of wintergreens fabric may be itchy to some just ok for me for reference xs bog on lbs dd in waist
740,5.0,the softest cotton gauze but not see through relaxed but the sleeves neckline make it flattering a gorgeous blue in person so in love with this dress going back for it in white
741,5.0,best smartphone at this price i am fall in love with super amoled screen my usuage is low to medium and gets day battery life its too wounderfull at this price range camera quality is justify price of product low weight big screen i am fully in love with this product at this price range
742,2.0,after using more than days am writing the review and my feedback about this phone is negativemost negative point is this phone too much slownot a good purchase i must go with other brand samsung is as usual too slow and purchase this phone is horrible decision net is not working good even a normal working on this phone sometime take too much time
743,1.0,as the phone is an upgrade version but it does not support the features of its old mi phones like note note note the features it have are very basics and even doesnt included security for app locks
744,5.0,so far so goodits only my second day with the phone im very happy with amazon delivery the battery seems to be really good as ive charged it only once and its still running after hours with about percent left i used the phone quite a bit as well no games just videos and social media however i have noticed that the network reception is not as good as my previously owned redmi note
745,4.0,the phone quality is good but not so good about camera is a budgeted phone with gb ram
746,2.0,i really love the idea behind this however the fit doesnt work for me im usually a s or xs in retailer tops and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops this one runs small though the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width the neckline was very high higher than it looks in the model photo and the armholes were too big so i dont think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue the other criticism is that the front is not lined
747,5.0,this review is for both the shampoo and conditioner because i use them together i am always willing to try new products once i run out of whatever ive been using so when i looked up reviews for organix and saw that this particular line got good reviews i decided to give it a go im so glad i did its unlike anything else ive tried in that the shampoo lathers very well for a sulfateparaben free product at least compared to others ive tried and the conditioner really feels more like a creamy oil it smells yummy and left my hair feeling very pampered silky and shiny even though it doesnt leave my hair feeling weighed down i will still use a clarifying shampoocond once a week to keep it from getting any buildup
748,4.0,recently i bought boat aux cable then i know able its durability and good quality then i bought this cable and this is the best qaulity cable available online with years warranty its worth the price
749,1.0,ordered a l and xl the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt both sizes had to be returned
750,2.0,steps counting is very very worst even it couts only for hand movements while driving car it counts stpes for five stpes movement it show steps battery drains very fastly in hours almost drains
751,3.0,fingerprint sensor few times not respond another negative is when call completes the screen doesnot respond only blank for few seconds and battery life is not much to hold the phone for a day camera quality nice builtup looks of phone is nice
752,5.0,what else to say about this sandisk ultra gb micro sd xc just perfect as all sandisk cards
753,4.0,it looks very premium and comfortableits camera performance is very good very loud sound i ever hear but there is not enough good indisplay fingerprint sensor as usually other phone workits slow but only good
754,4.0,ive used a lot of different brands of argan oil in the last two years and this one is definitely my favorite when used with a light hand it really penetrates hair nicely and doesnt leave it oily it smells great i like to braid my hair right out of the shower and once its dried about halfway i put a bit of the argan oil over the braids it does wonders and leaves my hair soft packaging is good a little goes a long ways i just wish there was a cleaner way of getting the product out rather than glopping it on your fingers however ill definitely buy this again
755,2.0,i have purchased two of these mobile for me and for brother the main issue is very bad hardware display is very brittle both the phones display has broken within months i have used redmis and the hardware was very good its display didnot break even after falling down many times redmi hardware quality is very bad even the signal reception in of the redmi has gone very weak mi has gone down in providing the promised quality in this phone
756,2.0,in one month the card is not working properly whaste of money
757,2.0,phone is getting hanged the moment camera is on and without loading anything memory is is saying full phone needs to be restarted regularly not up to marknot expected atleast from samsung such a disappointment

761,3.0,first i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to mens tie it is a thick weight silky feel next i was surprised by the cut i wear a petite and the waist of the large is at least a size if not smaller finally the length was really long i realize i am and buying nonpetite sizes but the cut was high ankle on me i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric both are unusual and good for fallwinter but i did not like the rest
762,5.0,love this tunic its super comfy cute i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint looks great with jeans and boots
763,5.0,kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable great fit good colors and doesnt wrinkle easily
764,3.0,not great response on touch and okay ui experience
765,3.0,i wanted to love this dress but sadly i will be returning the color looked fairly different in person than on the model i thought it was a brownerneutral hue but the dress is almost like a yellow seersuckerish with brownish moth printing was cuter than expected the sweetheart neckline is darling but that is where it fit me poorly i have a c bust and the cups of the size were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes the straps were also way too long and falling off my
766,4.0,i usually wear a medium in tops from deletta so i would say this top is true to size i personally loved the fit in the front the seam goes up slightly to follow the bust line there are some gathers in that area as well so that any little bulges in the tummy area are hidden the fabric falls nicely there the seam at the waist on the side and back hit exactly at my waist i love both of the prints the tops seem to be well made time will tell
767,2.0,hardware corrupted processor is slower than pentium you cannot even watch movies without refreshing after minutes worst product ever
768,1.0,mic is so worst that it catchs all background noise while traveling its difficult to talk on mobile bcoz opposite person will not able to hear you bcoz of background noise
769,5.0,camera quality is best overall performance is good amazing experience in using
770,3.0,fingerprint reader is not that fast didnt used face recognition was never interested in it so not gonna talk about it battery is awesome lasted for around days with above average use camera is not that good i expected a much better experience especially when competitors like redmi note pro provides a real good camera selfi cam is more pathetic i dont know if it can be improved by a software updation if its then i would like to have it soon very disappointed with selfie cam dont want to talk about gameing experience because i dont play games that much mobile looks good it gives a premium feel oh i forgot about amoled experience its really nice display is unbeatable in its segment overall i think im just okay with the money i spend
771,5.0,its great product using from year nice material good sound quality you should invest in this product
772,2.0,sorry to say but i have to pull down rating from to the card went bad in just couple of months no option to return as its beyond policythe card came on time good packaging and works so what else to add for this gb sd card
773,3.0,nice weight and loved the design but the inside was what i loved the most it doesnt show in the photos but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is doublesided so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background cute detail the only drawback was the length of the sleeves they were about too longand i have long arms there wasnt enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up the only other option i came up with was to fold
774,2.0,very poor battery and fast draining not enough capacity too much heating its a failure product which released by mi pl dont buy it by vijayakumar
775,2.0,unlock problem occured
776,5.0,all the features of the phone are awesome the camera is worth the price along with the rest of the features no lagging sensors and face recognition are fast it only has two minor issues call gets on hold while talking maybe because it doesnt have the conventional sensors it lacks samsung apps like knox secure folder or mini pay
777,5.0,the data transfer speed is better than class microsd card as expected
778,2.0,based on the strength of the other reviews i thought this sweater would be amazing but i was disappointed the knit is very thin cheap looking and weak that it wont last a season undamaged it reminds me of a duster i bought years ago at a discount fastfashion retailer when i was a student sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare the drape is not structured enougheverything about this screams over priced bath
779,3.0,i bought gb this week performance is good but this phone does not give very royal look specially cheap plastic back cover brings this phone in to oppo vivo level ear peice is not very good overall ok product i always recommend samsung due to its after sales and services
780,1.0,sound quality is very poor
781,4.0,beautiful dress but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist it runs huge im and a ml but the small petite is what looks and fits the best there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist i received a lot of compliments on this dress glad i kept trying on smaller sizes
782,2.0,bluetooth disconnects automatically after about minutes of non usage everytime you take a break when you come back you have to reconnect thats really stupid battery backup is poor few hours at best sound quality is so so for the quality and features its overpriced
783,5.0,great product at this price range bass is pretty great and youd be amazed how loud it sounds like at full volume
784,3.0,this sweater is beautiful and well made but i found the cut strange and unflattering i ordered it in my usual size small and it was too big in the shoulders and arms with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms but it just fit me in the chest and would be too tight if i sized down this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual
785,4.0,i was happy to see this top come back after being sold out the cream is a pretty colornot too warm toned the cut is true to size although very fitted in the arm hole area the sleeves rather fitted the fabric of the sleeves is fairly fragile but should be doable if not overly worn the chest fitted with an aline cut rather loser in the back it is also somewhat see through although not as bad as some i have tried overall its a really great top but would need to be worn with care gr
786,1.0,i have received apple iphone in damage condition outer and inner box both were opened and iphone was not in original company shrink packing home button was not working
787,1.0,not louder dont buy this
788,2.0,cons pathetic camera quality didnt even feel mp with the mp camerathe camera of the lower variant m is superb and here they couldnt deliver that quality let alone better it late responsive fingerprint scanner the ui is just not right small things can make or break things for user making a user friendly ui isnt something samsung has done here eg the app search bar doesnt open with the keyboard automatically whats the use of it then the multiple wallpaper option is for lock screen but not the phone wallpaper lol you cant setup dps for apps like fb whatsapp from the photo gallery you can do it through the app only even way smaller brands like mi and honor have this maybe oppo and vivo eid have this etc etc the gradient blue phone color is yuck disgusting blue to seagreen gradient could have been better neutrals the phone is thicker and heavier than m considering the kmah battery im fine with it premium feel of the phone design and bezel less screen pros honestly nothing special other than this being a samsung phone
789,1.0,this phone is dead after months and as always amazon do not have any role to get serviced or replaced you have to make rounds of service center where they will make excuses even when phone is in warranty period avoid this chinese product
790,2.0,i waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away i am disappointed the lace fabric is very stiff i should have listened to the previous reviewer i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress had the fabric been different i think it would be a great dress
791,4.0,likes look and feel mobile functions like touch sensitivity status bar enhancement speed in terms mobile reacts when you choose something on screen dislikes mobile camera is not upto the mark it is not samoled screen as mentioned on the box status bar notifications like time mobile signals and wifi status is not completely showing top portion is covered with black end points which is why i am disappointed and not sure whether this is the case with others as well it that is the case then samsung has to rectify this glitz with patch updates
792,1.0,this shirt has absolutely no shape look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxyness of this shirt the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt i even ordered the xs at and lbs but found it too baggy returned
793,4.0,i bought this dress on clearance and think it will be cute next summer on a superhot day with ballet flats i have no idea what its doing in the fall collection am looking forward to wearing it months from now
794,5.0,the product is betterbt battry not so satisfactory
795,3.0,i said i wouldnt buy it again but thats mostly because of my tendency to not repurchase anything unless it becomes a hg product im also looking more for uv and heat protection now that im actually starting to heat style my hair sometimes again i havent really even used a hair dryer very often for like years so i was mostly using this on my hair as it air dried until about a month ago i havent really looked into the ingredients to see if this actually does anything more than put a bandaid on the issue of dryness and the like but i definitely notice a difference in my hair when i use this versus when i dont and i do like it for the most part is it really doing anything for my hair beyond making it look better maybe not my guess is the silicone makes my hair look nicer at the time but that could be it however i think that this has helped prevent breakage because my hair tangles way less when i use it again probably because of the silicones making my hair smoother so i think it helps my hair a bit but i really havent done enough research into siliconecontaining products to form an opinion beyond that i think more research in general is needed i have very fine totally straight hair but i also have a lot of hair and i usually keep it kind of long to around midback give or take a couple of inches my hair gets dry very easily and can start to break and it just looks awful so i try to almost exclusively use moisturizing products the problem with that is how heavy some of those products can be which isnt great when you have hair that refuses to hold volume but this stuff as long as i dont go overboard it doesnt weigh my hair down and i notice an immediate improvement in the way my hair looks and feels i absolutely love the scent of this stuff and i think even my husband has commented on how pleasant it is its not quite the same coconuty scent you find in some tanning products and the like but its also not quite real coconut or coconut oil its kind of in between a little sweeter than real coconut but not overpowering ive also only ever used this on color treated hair and ive never noticed any problems with my color fading faster whether it was permanent dyes or something like manic panic pros smells nice and not too strong makes my hair look and feel smoother fewer tangleseasier time brushing my hair adds a little shine doesnt feel heavyweigh my hair down although it might with curls but its hard to tell because my hair doesnt easily hold a curl anyway doesnt feel greasy or weird hasnt faded my dyed hair doesnt seem to build up in my hairwashes out easily cons i think this might sometimes cause me to break out where my hair touches my face while i sleep
796,2.0,i am reasonably petite but i like sweaters very oversized and large so i ordered this sweater in a large i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size the sweater ended up looking very awkward with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short waistlength stomach i do
797,4.0,the product is perfect for budget camera was good battery life ok ok

799,3.0,i found both colors and jumped on this shirt then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it it is too hot to wear in the summer putting a tee under ruins the look i am very flat chested so it hung well but there is lots of shirt both went back in exchange for two wearable items
800,1.0,i should have listened to the previous review online before ordering unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off i love uniquely shaped wraps like this but this one didnt make the cut for me
801,2.0,the peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage not at my natural waist so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up i am busty so its possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem i was disappointed to return it the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one
802,2.0,the hdmi extension doesnt work at all black screen on boot firestick works fine without the attachment
803,2.0,very limited

805,3.0,i wanted to love this top but couldnt i am curvy dd and this accentuated my hips which is not needed and made my chestwhole shape seem boxy i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build the bottom would help give some shape pleating on front would help chest seem larger i did love the color and construction lace details sleeves
806,3.0,i ordered this online and i love the style but didnt like the print as much as i thought i would
807,2.0,i am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with my recent preference has been for highrise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash when i tried these on in my normal size they were so cute that i bought them fullpriced i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy which is what makes them soft and comfortable but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours by th
808,5.0,price worthy good product
809,2.0,this dress is great if youre very skinny and have no chest otherwise it makes you look dowdy the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion this one is going back
810,2.0,camera quality is not good if it has mpl camera it must show i compared it with vivo camera vivo is far better shows real colors in pictures but not thi samsung phone i want to buy vivo rsk phone but dont see any replacement option on amazon i faced the same replacement issue with flipkart and i stopped purchasing from there but i think amazon is doing same thing here like flipkart amazon at least have option to replace mobile phones
811,1.0,worst experience
812,4.0,beautiful print agree with other reviewers that the small snap at the bust is inadequate for anyone with a d or greater bust size the dress was a perfect length on me with heels even after i kicked off my heels i didnt find it too long like other reviewers wind does open op the front so i may get it altered so its no longer a true wrap dress
813,2.0,i paired this with the shampoo and ive written a more lengthy review on that but overall the only thing i like about it is the smell both products made my hair too greasy
814,4.0,maybe im hanging out with my grandson too much because this appealed to the kid in me looks great under a jean jacket and under a leather jacket oh and cool under a silk bomber jacket as well

817,5.0,i walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on i am so glad she did this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets after assessing it further i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down i bought a small i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist i am ft lbs b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure for
818,2.0,doesnt understand lots of questions
819,1.0,worst product after using this for one month it stopped workingi am unable to process through warranty
820,2.0,first of all this is not pullover styling there is a side zipper i wouldnt have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath not at all what is looks like or is described as sadly will be returning but im sure i will find something to exchange it for
821,3.0,i coveted this dress for so long but this was a case of the photo giving me a different visual impression than seeing it in real life the gold patterns on top arent shiny and delicate in person as i had imagined and they actually make a very strong impression up close and are painted on it seems the mesh they lay on is also more coarse than i had hoped the coolest part about this dress though is the shiny sequined black underlay the photo doesnt do that component justice i was s
822,3.0,good product but some time heating problem in long time charging and loose in some mobiles
823,1.0,product is looking good but power bank charging level is too bad because its take half day to charge and battery life is good after three month of usage its doesnt charge anything but when i connected with device power light is blinking but not chargingsad news is there is no return policy
824,1.0,i just received this mobile when i checked back panel theres uneven color near camera i complained it to customer care they asked me to wait for days a technician will visit and suggest the next course of action this is pathetic
825,2.0,what a pity this blouse has a beautiful design however it doesnt fit well on the body its not really a size problem its just not a well fitted blouse the color is very deceptive it looks white on the picture but its actually pink im probably going to return it
826,1.0,would not recommend this phone to anyone because there are so many on screen advertisement that sometimes it becomes difficult to even unlock the phone or use the phone properly tried turning off the ads using tutorial but still its not working and as soon as i open my phone there are ads waiting to be shown it is very frustrating and makes the phone literally slow and useless
827,3.0,looks great on the model but if youre curvy it looks very frumpy
828,4.0,i somehow missed that there was a slit in the front of this tunic below the buttons it looks fine on im just wondering if i can still pull it off with only leggings underneath why i got it otherwise just as pictured im lbs and got an xs
829,4.0,when i placed this in my galaxy s phone it read it right away at gb which is expected to loose a few gb i transferred file from my old card and it was done fast although i didnt have large files to start with i had been looking for a large card and this one fits the bill the other reviews helped sway my choice i would recommend this card so far no issues
830,4.0,the first and the middle part is superb i get glued to the book but disappointed at the ending parts so i will put four stars only
831,4.0,camera quality could be better build quality is also good good for light to medium usage and not for gamers if compared to other smartphones in the same price range then better to go fo m
832,2.0,i hate to be so negative but i cant believe this shirt has so many positive reviews it is stiff silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse looks cheap
833,4.0,i was looking for a good navy top for the springsummer to wear with white denim for a nautical look this top is perfect and i especially like the neck for when its cooler in the evenings
834,3.0,i returned it only because the volume is lower than i expected its best for smaller rooms not a livingfamily room
835,1.0,got one of the worst product throgh amazon worst packing i have ever seen half of the packet was wet no air bobble wrapper water droplets were on the screen of mobile and touch screen is showing erratic behavior not able to connect wifi cant enter any alphabets requested for replacement but agent didnt give new phone and didnt take defective one talked to amazon customer care several times but no one solve the proble the bad piece is still with me and not able to return it never expected such a nonresponsive support from amazon i just want to return the product and want my money back
836,5.0,i fell in love with these trousers as soon as i saw them online i am a big fan of essentiel antwerp their designs are unique and bold these trousers definitely fit their aesthetic the print is darker compared to the picture making the green more of a dark olive and the blue almost looks black they have an elastic waist so that helps for some of us who have a wider bottom they cinch back in once they are buttoned at the waist so it doesnt make your hips look wide the fabric is soft and
837,2.0,photo quality is worst as an user of dslr ps cameras smart phones with good photography capability i understand this samsung phone camera hardware may be good but the image processing software algorithm etc are not good at all hence the final output is very very bad samsung must look into this and release updated camera software otherwise its going to be a strictly no go zone people should not buy this phone second bad thing is battery back up and battery management they advertise with arjun bajpai i thought it will have good backup however it is disappointing every alternate day i have to charge i dont use any games or download many things its general phonecalls and net surfing and couple of photographs however the phone charge do not last more than a day and the charger is incapable because the battery size is huge and charger charging power is less hence it takes about hours to charge full every night i am leaving this on charge and morning it is ready to use but by night battery drains out is there any option to return this device since i am not satisfied with the performance of the phone
838,4.0,this top runs large for sure and reminds me more of a tunic due to the length nice detailing around neck and sleeves and the paisley print on the side hems is super cute size down
839,3.0,not as per expectationscan charge your phone only twicewhat is the point of having a power bank if you will have to charge it every day

842,1.0,please dont buy this mobile its just a month and camera has conked off since it wasnt within replacement period i need to go to external vendor for replacementservice i had oneplus t and got this in exchange thinking to upgrade but never thought i would be cheated with this pathetic quality how can such costly and oneplus phone can blank out with camera and other in built apps as mentioned in oneplus community i checked for alternatives was told to erase and go back to factory reset mode did it twice but no use with blacked out apps i seriously doubt the quality of oneplus now lost faith in this brand
843,2.0,oh what a disappointment i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam so back it goes and i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost for this top
844,3.0,i was so excited to receive this romper its a great material but its actually a bit drab the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang its not flattering as it is very roomy
845,4.0,having some issues during installation but customer service rectified the issue
846,4.0,ill use this review to mostly say what im not a fan of in this particular iphone model but first whats good battery life is excellent so far charged to hours ago and im at currently though i have not used the phone much in that period sound quality is a touch better than on the s i think portrait mode on the camera is great everything else is more or less the same the chip is faster but my old phone wasnt slow in the least so theres no palpable difference really the screen resolution is the same as far as im aware i havent had occasion to test the water resistance but its definitely good to have whats not so good the weight this is supposed to be grams which is more than greater than the weight of the iphone s my old phone it certainly feels like it add about odd grams for even the lightest case and you do need a case this is a superslippery phone on the plus side youre pretty much always conscious of it being in your pocket and youll probably notice if it fell out the size feels somewhat monstrous at least for now inches is massive coming from the of the s combine the extra size with the extra weight and i feel less secure and comfortable holding this phone in one hand than i did my old phone it generally feels less manoeuvrable than a smaller phone and my hands are reasonably large that translates to a somewhat poorer experience overall anyway i cant complain i knew about the size before making the purchase but just a note for people who are thinking of upsizing the good thing about that is that ill probably use the phone less which is something we all need to do in general face id has been a bit of a pain for me so far doesnt work when you have sunglasses on or in lowlight conditions though it is supposed to learn your face and get better as you go along three weeks in i cant say there has been much of a change would have loved to have an option to immediately evoke the passcode input which now takes more than two seconds to come up after face id fails the only thing i like about face id at the moment is that it lowers the volume of alerts if youre looking at the phone when im out walking with this phone in my hand i usually take care to have the screen angled towards the ground so that the sensor does not see my face somehow and bring the screen to life but it does do this off and on worse when the screen comes alive like this if a song is playing my thumb or fingers end up skipping or replaying the track i dont know if the tru tone on my unit is wonky but the warmth of the backlighting seems to change more often than it did on my old phone the absence of a headphone jack is as millions of people have observed a severe pain in the neck for those who dont want to use wireless earphones that make you look like an alien and are based on bluetooth which feels past its time as a protocol spotify is quite buggy but then it was nearly as bad on my old phone so thats probably a spotify problem people talk about the massive bezel but to me unless someone is pointing it out to me i dont really notice it itll be different for those who have used the x i suppose i cant say im regretting having bought this i probably wouldnt have bought it just yet if i hadnt planned on giving my s to a family member i hope it grows on me update june three months in i have got completely used to the size and weight of this phone in the hand onehanded operation is still not safe or convenient but i have stopped thinking of it as a massive phone when i hold an iphone s in my hand it now feels impossibly small face id still does not recognise my face when im wearing dark glasses it does usually recognise it with or without regular glasses on however but sometimes in lowlight conditions i need to move the phone up to face level before it will unlock apple might need to consider allowing users to add more than the one alternative look in face id that it does at present before this problem is solved the problems i had with the screen waking up have almost vanished i suppose it was the edges of my fingers touching the screen inadvertently when i held it in my hand that woke it up
847,5.0,havent experienced any problems arrived really fast its a great price for the gb size and was compatible with my android os tablet well worth the price i plus sandisk is a reputable brand i trust highly recommended

856,4.0,rompers are usually tough for me i am petite especially on top lbs a but have a healthy butt and hips which can make sizing difficult in this romper i tried a regular xs and found the fit very flattering the top was blousey on me but not overly so and the arm holes didnt gape which is usually an issue for me with nonpetite sizing the elastic waistband is also great as you can adjust it to hit you in a flattering spot and keep the shorts from being too short which

863,4.0,i was taking my time with this purchase i needed a top for a pair of ombr silk pants that i had tailored to fit but everytime i put these pants on i couldnt find any top to come close to matchespecially since the pants are for a more sophisticated look well this top fits that perfectly and im excited to pair them for a nice dinner out plus i was equally excited when i could pair the top with my jeans and sandals
864,5.0,beautiful white denim pants the fit is perfect fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom very classy and versatile cut paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception will be getting them hemmed but i dont mind because they are perfect
865,3.0,the product is quite good has got a lot of functions but is kinda hactic to use we need to sync the watch data regularly and that annoys me when it takes some time it also does not work properly when we lift our wrist to look at the time we need to press the home button
866,4.0,i got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didnt have to have it altered in the length can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline its a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th
867,1.0,i saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful i on the other hand looked awful the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff so the dress didnt move with me it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out then to contribute to the volume the sleeve is not set in it is a raglan style that on me looked more like a bat suit than what i was hoping for a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair also the belt didnt enhance the
868,5.0,amazing product
869,2.0,i ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints while it appears to be made with quality it runs really large also in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy the actual fabric is just flat cotton its a very casual dress not as dressy as pictured its also quite shapeless on im returning it
870,2.0,as like as described
871,1.0,i ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more denim version the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser less flattering fit returned it and kept the regular ag stevie

877,3.0,i ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering i am tall about pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape if you like a loose fit this might be for you the material is thicker and warm and comfortable i would suggest ordering down a size
878,3.0,it really is a beautiful sweater the material is super soft and feels luxurious unfortunately it just looked too bulky on me and accentuated my width maybe if i were taller i could pull it off

947,3.0,its unbelievable that this phone is made by xiaomi one of the poor displays ive seen the pixels are so obviously visible the finger print sensor is too slow id rather be happy with a faster offscreen finger print sensor no fast charger inside box unlike realme pro which is better than mi a in all aspects camera is not bad asus max pro m camera is so top notch for that price cant believe that companies are still pulling off stunts talking megapixel terms only significant pro so far imo is that this is an android one phone luckily no xiaomi bloatware however i was flabbergasted to find mi services in settings which allows to send data to xiaomi servers
948,4.0,i loved this when i saw it online tried it on in the store and though it is beautiful its a lot of sweater its a a bit heavy in weight the buttons on the collar give you the option to wear it up or open as shown in the picture the problem was that when it was open the big button loop hung down right in front that was probably the determining factor against purchasing it if it goes on sale i may reconsider
949,4.0,i am buying only after seeing public review n colour other things will get back soon if type c jack den this product will be more den enough
950,2.0,screen size width is not big battery life is also not as expected

953,4.0,material quality of glass could be better
954,1.0,theres a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse the print is lovely but the fit is very odd its pulls at and is very tight through the bust too i wear medium or large and ordered size large if youre less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide returned
955,1.0,rd class product in normal use battery doesnt last whole day after fully charged need to charge twice in a day this is my replacement handset whereas first one was used to discharge more faster than this over all quality is poor

957,5.0,i bought this product on a whim i got a cash back coupon at cvs and i decided to use it right then and there before it expired on me which is what usually happens it was displayed close to the check out counter and i grabbed it along with a couple of chapsticks to equal out to the ten bucks i tend to love anything quotcoconuttyquot so i knew i would probably love the smell at least what i didnt expect was how great my hair felt after using this it was soft and shiny and very tame normally this time of year with the humidity my hair can be a frizzy yucky mess the milk really tamed the wild beast and i would recommend it to friends and i plan on making it a regular in my daily beauty routine
958,3.0,i really wanted to love this sweater after reading the reviews but when i received it i was sadly disappointed it is pretty boxy and not much shape could be cute for casual outfits but i was looking for some dressier sweaters
959,3.0,i love the concept of an airy flowing sweater that has great detail this item stole my heart online however i am fairly petite and it looked like it was drowning me the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldnt hold it up it kept falling off my shoulders i ended up returning i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders
960,2.0,it was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height the pullon styling is a fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening i was afraid it might rip a seam the fabric seems low quality like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others overall not the dress or quality i expected
961,2.0,i ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie this item was too small especailly across the bust it was very wellmade and the color green is beautiful but unfortunately i will not be able to wear it so disappointed

966,4.0,in theory this dress was perfect for me the colors the embroidery the sheer top and keyhole back so romantic sigh something about the fit just kept it from being a wow moment im usually the was way too big the more fitted but still it wasnt quite right the sheer part dips quite low and sizing down helped but it could still be a lil dangerous i kept feeling like it wasnt defining my waist enough and wanted a tighter waist and more full skirt maybe i would have fel

971,4.0,my daughter bought this sweater in xs in white and i tried it on it was a little too tight but long enough to wear with leggings so i ordered the red in a s it just covers my butt in the back not nearly as long as my daughters i still love the sweater and will wear it with jeans but it is way too short to wear with leggings i dont understand how there can be such a difference in the same sweater a size larger and at least inches shorter if not for that i would have rated it a

979,2.0,oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment the color is wonderful the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but thats where the compliments end its an itchy cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece so bummed so so bummed

981,2.0,battery quality is worst i have honor c and it gives days backup and this phone last only hours with medium usage no fast charger takes tradatitional hours for full charging if u want to waste your money then go for it if u r not brand conscious buy other brands phone with much more better configurations that too almost half of its price
982,4.0,its impossible to tell but this dress is made from very fine wale corduroy the neckline is very flattering for a smaller chested woman with a sharp cut that makes a strapless bra required for peace of mind the dress does have snaps to hold your bra straps in but i went ahead with a strapless the back has a neat square cut the skirt is slightly longer on both sides which gives the dress movement even though the material is heavier than typically used for this season or cut i wore it
983,4.0,all features were very good a must buy worth all the money spent need to give a detailed manual
984,4.0,timely delivery book is very insightful and makes you aware of dos and donts good for people mangers

1000,5.0,connects wifi well excellentsharp pic quality woth dthwith sd channels its good or ok had reviewed for all the brands before buying now it almost months of usage worth to buy at this price range
1001,2.0,online this looks like a great sweater i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured in fact im pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer unfortunately this sweater will not work for me as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look pounds heavier

1011,1.0,such a bad and damaged product
1012,2.0,i too was drawn in by the attractive packaging and also the organic marketing also it was on sale at my local drugstore buy one get one free so i got the shampoo and the conditoner i was pretty excited to try it especially because i loved the smell after using half of both bottles though the smell is the only thing i like about this product my hair is pretty fine so i can get away with not using conditioner but after using this shampoo my hair was so tangled that i absolutely needed the conditioner so half my hair wouldnt break off when i tried to brush it out the first week my hair was dull and flat i had to combine use of this shampoo with a root volumizer which again i normally do not have to do i used this shampoo for about three weeks then switched back to the shampoo i was using before i will not buy it again
1013,2.0,i bought this for my samsung galaxy s i dont know if it is my phone or the card but my phone says it was unexpectedly removed from time to time my wifes phone doesnt do it as often but still does it very fast but unreliable i have had many sandisk before and this is the only one i have had problems with i have read that there were some that were poorly made thinking i will send it back and give it another chance
1014,5.0,good battery life and sound quality is above average
1015,5.0,for the price very good phone
1016,2.0,you can truly buy this cheaper at walmart than anywhere else i have seen for the price it is there i consider this to be fairly priced because its not a normal drugstore conditioner it has better ingredients and the packaging is recycled it also isnt tested on animals the packaging is very posh and as i mentioned recycled so i greatly enjoyed it the product itself was not good but not the worst the smell is amazing and tropical my curls werent greatly impacted in comparison with the other conditioners ive tried recently which were the bed head red bottle reconstructing one and organix sea mineral moisture i only used this in conjunction with the shampoo so i cant speak as to how it performs with other shampoos this made my hair the shiniest it has ever been but also dried my hair out a bit by the end of the bottle i will not be repurchasing and since it is not one of my favorites i wouldnt recommend it i would recommend people try another coinsirioner from this brand

1021,4.0,i have been on the hunt for a replacement cargo jacket for about a year now i thought this one was going to be it ordered it right away i got it in an xl as retailer coats always seem to run small on me i am very busty so sometimes the more fitted styles wont even close without a big gap this is not the case with this jacket it runs really big it looks like it could be an xxxlbut the design is great with a zipper and button closures pockets and cute back cutthe color is slightly
1022,2.0,so im not sure if its just my body type or what but this did nothing for me the bottom which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium im a size bottom and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose i just think this one is going to take the right body type it could look really beautiful on the right person just not me
1023,1.0,in the price range the rear camera and the front camera quality is very poori am very disappointed with this price range and my expectations gone wrong if i was go for real me x or oppo k is much better than this phone also note pro is better than this headphone also missing
1024,1.0,so disappointed i love retailer this was a huge disappointment i am and pounds when i put it on all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look if i wasnt so disappointed i might have laughed this had to have been a design mistake ive truly never seen something so unflattering

1032,1.0,continued from prior post during her few minutes away she looked up the product online to check the ingredients because she was astounded that a shampoo could do that much damage the lady in the shampoo bowl right next to me witnessed everything happening to me and said quotwhat is that product tell me so i can avoid itquot when she came back she told me that in her professional opinion sometimes keratin can be too drying even though on your shampoo bottle it only says quotthis rich formual of brazilian coconut oil and keratin proteins to smooth and strengthen your curly or wavy tressesquot the stylist felt that my hair had an extreme reaction to this dryness and that is why i got massive clumps of impenetrable tangles at that point that was little comfort somewhat of an explanation sure but little comfort at this point i have been laying back in a shampoo bowl with two stylists working with litte success on getting these out and quotthesequot are all over the back of my head thinking of what to do next they put more intense conditioner on my head put me in a plastic cap and put me under head hoping that would soften these dreadlockstyle clumps during that time they consulted with the lead stylist as to what to do next after awhile the lead stylist knelt down beside my dryer and the concerned look on her face made me start to cry immediately i told her quotdont tell me you cant do anything but cut them out right i knew itquot she assured me not to worry that she would do all she could to help me so she wouldnt have to cut them out that she has experience working with some clients with dreadlocks and has experience with difficult processes like this i felt better somewhat for the time being the lead stylist allison took me back to her station and with the assistance of the two other stylists they began again the tedious and painstaking tast of trying to undo these wickedly tight clumps of hair after another hours of this i hesitatingly asked quotso you still think you dont have to cut it out if you did how much would you have to take offquot allison paused and put her hand where the clump ended and said quoteight inches but i dont want to have to do that lets keep tryingquot all i heard was inches i sat there praying for god to give her and the other stylists the continued patience and skill to work through my hair so it wouldnt have to be cut i came into this salon at pm i left a little after pm this is how long it took stylists to get through this hairmagedden and i dont say that to be funny i mean it and the physical pain of them trying to get through was excruciating despite their best efforts to minimize my discomfort i said i will go through anything just as long as they can try and save my long hair when all stylists got through i was back by the shampoo bowl getting a light shampoo and another deep condition after that they didnt want to dry or style my hair because of all that me and my hair went through in those hours they left it damp and gently braided it and told me to let it dry that way and let my hair and scalp rest they also suggested that i take some ibuprofen when i get home to help me with all the pain i went through today is the th the day after my hair is still in the braid and im afraid to take it out because i expect to see considerable damage from all the picking they did with those rat tail combs mind you i am forever grateful for all their hard work and patience they saved my long hair i cant say enough about these women and the wonderful job they did and also their compassion despite how my long hair looks now and the damage done i still have it they could have taken the lazy way out and advised that i cut it but they didnt they saw my tears and panic and went to work to try and save my hair like those stylists its astounding to me that your shampoo could do so much damage a shampoo what on earth why if i was prone to fooling around with chemicals and colors at home well then i guess i deserve to have my hair wrecked and shouldnt cry about it but i dont i simply washed my hair this appointment yesterday cost me this is the most quotexpensive shampooquot ive ever had i dont know what you can do as a company to warn people on your bottles but you need to do something this has been the most harrowing experience i have ever had costly in physical pain and money not too mention the fear i had the whole time its simply wrong that a product could do that these stylists talked to me about keratin and the new fad about brazilian treatments it works for some but it can be very drying grant you i did not use a chemical at home but only a shampoo but the shampoo touts quotbrazilian therapy with keratinquot if there are risks with keratin it should say so on your bottle i told they stylists that i thought keratin was a good thing that it is a protein and a building block for hair they said yes thats true but keratin can be very drying on some people and in my case it was so drying it made my hair form very bad clumps to say that im disappointed is an understatement i dont even want to look at my hair at this point i can also assure you that i saw loads and loads of hair fall to the floor as they were attempting to undo these massive clumps but not because of them being careless they were not but trying to be gentle as possible really what stylists do you know that wants to stand for hours trying to undo a mess like that not many but they did i told them that i would let your company know what happened if you have any questions or doubts im sure you can talk to the lead stylist allison the ha
1033,4.0,i love this shirt i ordered a large because i am taller and i wanted the length to be right while its a little baggy its still very flattering and ive received lots of compliments on it the color is exactly what is show in the image its a versatile shirt depending on what you pair it with it can be appropriate for work dinner or a night out id definitely recommend this shirt to a friend
1034,2.0,i purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet the style is very cute but the fabric is quite thin she will have to make that call but if i had bought it for myself it would be going back im not willing to wear a camisole under a tshirt it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when its washed so that remains to be seen
1035,4.0,great summer shirt loose fitting but especially wide the button gather in back is a nice detail
1036,2.0,this iphone is in hearing problems what can i do
1037,3.0,i finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed pricebut i see why it is cute but serious size issues i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuiti would have needed more to even zip the top part i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fallwinternever too soon to plan ahead
1038,2.0,some times in call connection not establish its a basic problem and happening twice out of in this ration do not keeping missed call list properly
1039,2.0,after reading the reviews i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasnt flattering on me im pounds and generally wear a size small but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me it squeezed the bust a bit too much and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering
1040,2.0,apps keep crashing all day did not like the device
1041,5.0,i had to transfer my data from my wd hard drive to my mac worked as expected
1042,3.0,i have the echo and now the dotthe dot really is no where near the echo for performance and sound it really doesnt respond as well and in many case just ignores commands i like the echo so i was generous and gave the dot stars

1047,3.0,the oil is truly a quotdryquot oil most of the hair oils i have used make my hair look very oily but this one doesnt but i think it would be a lot better with a pump it gets quite messy when you have to poor it out
1048,3.0,it is good but very costly it is in us so when it is convert to indian rupees it should be k assuming exchange rate to be at so k is too much
1049,2.0,after seeing this on anthtos facebook page i was so excited to order i ended up going to a store and trying on i couldnt believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it i thought this ran quite big and the shape was odd lots of material in the middle i am a mom of young kids and didnt want people to think was on the way
1050,1.0,the charger isnt working and it will cost you to buy a new ine which amazon or apple wouldnt bother compensating my advice would be buying it in a certified apple store
1051,3.0,budget phone camera quality is good
1052,2.0,then this one is for you so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale based upon the pictures i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail but it is actually masking this skirts ugly secret a pouch yes it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen which does not lay flat the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots this one
1053,2.0,the camera is not even mp but one plus t claiming mp camera quality very bad images are very poor in resolution and gets detoriate if we zoom only x time pixels is very less and poor images in day light
1054,2.0,so youre thinking this is a red and black skirt right nope its an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line its really god awful

1059,4.0,everything is good sound pictures
1060,2.0,the green light wont go away
1061,1.0,bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top the waist has no stretch and their isnt a zipper you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders so cute in the pic but not realistic going back
1062,2.0,dont like it the back button is at the top left corner and cannot us in one hand
1063,4.0,mobile app
1064,2.0,after reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale im tall and lean but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures firstly the top has a strange transition to the skirt with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together if you blouse it and lay flat it invariably gets bunched as you wear it this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks creating less clean lines i also found the blue black
1065,4.0,i got this top in green and im overall happy with it i agree with the other reviewers that the material is thin and the quality not top notch and it certainly is overpriced for what it is especially with the shipping fee however the style is really cute love the lace up in the back and if flows nicely without billowing as is the case with so many retailer swing tops lately i didnt find it to be so see through that it would need a cami at least not the green color and a nude strapless br
1066,2.0,not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos i have wide shoulders and am slim and this made me look big all around i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this i am and ordered a medium also it curls under a bit at the waist one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through anyway i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning
1067,2.0,waste of money go for redmi note series
1068,3.0,ok

1071,5.0,very nise tv i like stomach
1072,1.0,ive requested a replacement so ill update this review after i receive a replacement but the first card i got it could be read but every time i put it into the computer it said there were errors with it it couldnt repair the errors i couldnt even format it using a command prompt to try and get it to work i could create folders on the card but not put anything into them or onto the card other than folders i tried many many things and nothing worked i know sandisk makes decent products so i will change the review later
1073,3.0,i didnt receive the wall mount for the tv
1074,2.0,theres something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut i cant move my arms in this dress otherwise the fit was fine the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds other than that the does nothing for your figure i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im lbs and dont buy it i know its tempting with the sale price
1075,2.0,im lbs dd normally a p or p in pants i ordered an and probably should have gone with a it was super unflatteringthe print was overwhelming for my pale skin it made my thin waist look larger than it really was and rode up the inside of my thighs i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth thats of the price and x as flattering if you have thick legs this may not be the suit for you i returned itso fast
1076,2.0,this tank is not very flattering there is a lot of fabric its very boxy the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey i even sized down and its still just wide im returning
1077,3.0,i have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans sadly i dont think these are it i love the design and style of these jeans great length great cut great color unfortunately in the weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like ive had them for years im so disappointed and will have to continue on my search apparently they dont make jeans like they used too
1078,1.0,it stopped working in months i have been trying to replace it coz its still under warranty
1079,2.0,wife bought this she likes i dont
1080,5.0,let me share my thoughts on one of the most talked features mah battery this is really handy and can last for full day of extensive usage i drained the battery to and it took this phone almost hours to full charge which is not bad overall this phone is quite impressive in this price segment and i am happy buyer
1081,2.0,this dress is just too baggy overall i am lbs and a size small was so unflattering i cant go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me it was already a little high on the small
1082,5.0,selfi camera quite disappointing otherwise all feature is best it comes with gyroscope and infrared sensor thats different from other phones
1083,5.0,added it to my samsung note ll and now i have gigs of storage i have everything in there that was on my other phone and i have only used of my capacity
1084,3.0,steps are not correct bluetooth option is fine
1085,5.0,soooooo cute fit like a dream look like regular pants could dress up or dress down i bought the grey and the slight herringbone pattern was so adorable going to buy in the black as well normally wear size got the small and fits perfect
1086,1.0,speakers are damaged
1087,4.0,value for money
1088,2.0,i didnt mind the scratchiness others proclaimed this garment had but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back looks great from the front but uncomfortable
1089,5.0,this is a great app the bot is so accurate to anything it gives me tips in gaming studies and life etc this app is also helpful if you were having problems in things also there are some problems about the server glitch but dont worry some glitches are just seconds overall a great app note the gpto is more powerful and accurate than the regular one
1090,1.0,friends this is the iiird time i am replacing the product in a period of one and half months do not buy this product any more one have to contact customer support every day
1091,5.0,hello friends i hv seen lot of bluetooth speaker in the market from the last monthsbt i dont like itone of my friend use this speakeri m totally shocked when i hear its voice qualityits mind blowingthen i purchase it frm amazonits coolvry clear sound and handyu can even carry in pockettheir is a hook on topu can also hang it wherever u wantguys if u want to buy bluetooth speaker then without any doubt go for itu gt the best qualitydont think n go for itpay less n get more
1092,5.0,mobile is awesome but i not get invoice so pls how i get my invoice of my phone
1093,2.0,i have amazon prime already and when i tried to connect everything on the app i still had to purchase the music portionwhich will be a monthly fee booksmonthly fee as well when i already have access via prime
1094,4.0,great phone for work not to big ad gets the job done
1095,2.0,i saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work the cut was so strange it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist i even ordered up a size based on reviews i ordered an when i normally where a small in things the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else
1096,4.0,awesome
1097,1.0,very old features some useful apps are not in this model very disappointed to buy this model
1098,3.0,im surprised other reviewers loved this one so much its completely different then how it looks on the model its much shorter which others do mention but it flares a lot enough to feel maternityish on me it looks fitted on the model maybe its my shape i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips i ordered an xs too i will say the material is very nice and its well made but its going back
1099,4.0,i was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum kind of an unnatural placement i sized up so it wasnt so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better
1100,3.0,i have two of these and use them for my galazy note its great having the flexibility to keep extra storage with you for your phabletso far they have done what they are intended to do
1101,2.0,i didnt realize that there were sequins on the design they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable the white material was also not very flattering on me it went back
1102,2.0,the technology is off to a good start but is way too immature for the likes of amazon the usability is very bad compared to the competitionas a single father of it was the introduction of the intercom ability that finally made me bite the bullet unfortunately the intercom seems to go out to the internet and back and the mics are very poor quality the combination means that due to audio degradation nine times out of ten you cant understand what the person on the other end is saying additionally i was really hoping to be able to broadcast messages such as hey everyone it is time to come and eat but you have to call each device individuallyas a lover of music i was hoping to be able to use this as a whole house speaker system again no go i understand that there are licensing issues for multiple streams but using it as multiple speakers should not have that limitation so the next logical step is to get multiple spotify or amazon premium music accounts which stinks but with the family plans didnt seem too horrible these are supposed to support that but it has been incredibly buggy for us causing major frustration and fighting between the kidsas a developer i was really excited about the ability to add skills and write my own as they boast over skills i thought it would be rare that i wouldnt be able to find something i wanted and when i did id just write it and maybe even find a way to make a few bucksno most utility skills are absolutely worthless and even the fun ones novelty wears off very quickly the reason the api is absolutely horrendous there is no way to communicate between dots there is no way to target an individual dot there is no way to have multiple users based on voice there is no way to set custom vocabulary like household peoples names there is no way to analyze the actual audio provided despite amazons amazing natural speech processing you still have to predict every possible word and every possible order the user might provide them in okay this list could go on and on and onfinally as a user at all i am shocked how frequently the voice recognition utterly fails i enunciate very clearly have trained the thing and live in central pa where the drawl is very mild i should not have to ask the same thing times and honestly am yelling by the time i get there so will probably be the first target when computers become sentient and understand that i have been yelling at them all this timein short if you have a lot of money they work as a decent music device and a handy way to check the time in the middle of the night but are mostly junk
1103,3.0,picture is good sound has not clear voice has not clear
1104,1.0,quality is not good
1105,1.0,gst no and company name not mentioned on invoice
1106,1.0,very poor streaming quality buffering a lot while other laptop and phone devices or playing the same content without any issues using same wireless network not satisfied
1107,3.0,this blouse runs large billows out slightly and hangs in a boxy straight way im normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse the blouse is lined with a lightweight material but i can still see through it just a little bit although very pretty the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing regardless i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because its light weight
1108,1.0,apparently you cannot return it im done with amazon
1109,1.0,the sound system is very bad
1110,4.0,this might be one of my new go to tops looks cute with jeans and a sweater or alone the arms are snug but not uncomfortable and i think it adds to the shirt
1111,3.0,very good fridge at low cost
1112,2.0,these looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops the fabric is nice and sturdy the colors are more vibrant than online the design however is terrible when i put them on i double checked to make sure they werent on backwards the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a s circus diaper look which is not good theyre also really tight compar
1113,2.0,as per the calculation it supposed to charge my phone times but it dose only once or sometime less then that every time i put the charge cable every time i suppose to click on start button its never start automatically once i forgot to put and i wasted my hrs because of not click on start button
1114,5.0,camera quality not much better but battery and performance amazing
1115,2.0,dont let the specs deceive you this is the weakest phone i ever used pls consider protection also into consideration they also gave me a cracked peice my phone fell from a knee height on a non rough surface and one crack so please consider protection once it will fall for sure also the polycarbonate case was very weak the top left was already there
1116,1.0,very bad quality this mobile
1117,1.0,wont do anything if you have apple devices waste of dollars all it does for me is provide rain music while i sleep
1118,5.0,its a complete package of budget phone so all average good excellent phone
1119,2.0,beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft but they didnt finish the bottom hem the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesnt make sense also while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest almost like a water mark just overall bad attent
1120,5.0,love it love it play with it every day
1121,5.0,product worth buying
1122,2.0,i agree with other reviewer the material of these jeans is not the same thin stretches and you end up pulling them up all the time i am a short curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back this seems to be the trend in jeansnydj also uses this fabricstretches too much
1123,3.0,after using more than a month positive camera speed storage display negative typec port only no additional audio port its pathetic when battery is low and you want to use your headphone too battery is mah this itself says that you have to be careful while traveling sometimes screen does not behave well while typing
1124,5.0,this tv is more than they show but some what picture quality is low but it is recovered in high and model
1125,4.0,screensuper amoled is superb batterymah is good for days ram and romgb gb is good for daily use and casual gaming processorgood for daily use and gaming cameragood in daylight condition but needs improvement in night photography overall camera still needs good improvement if compared with other phones camera in same price bracket phones with less price give better output than this fimgersensorquick n responsive lots of other use of sensor as well ui lots of features and gestures introduced in one ui build and weightbuild is decent back cover is necessary which is missing in the phone box weight is very good and doesnt seem too heavy for mah battery
1126,1.0,as the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back
1127,4.0,tv not working picture display stoped and getting black and white strips sanyo service took days time and issued new tv in place of old as of now its working fine good response from sanyo service team
1128,4.0,ultra stylish superb selfie cam consistent performance audibility is good fingerprint reader and face recognition works well
1129,2.0,navigation and music apps are not free we have to buy apps if we want navigation on watch and also we cant play music over the phone major drawback somewhat overweight i feel on my hand
1130,4.0,i dontr even know why they btohered making a tall size for this i would need a inch heel for the petite version which means regualr sized people should get petite also bigger as in loose i tried and and both ewre biggish thopugh i could honestly not tell the difference sales person told me to try so we shall see i will need to hem them if i kleep them though bronze color is very nice so is balck i ordered both for comparison lastly cut is very flatteringespeciall
1131,2.0,these run small i am and got a size they were a tad tight on top the waist fit but felt a little too snug short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material they are a dark blue animal print i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle they looked so silly i had to laugh even with the off these are going back not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person
1132,5.0,awesome phone a very good camera quality
1133,2.0,the quality is good as is the design idea but practically it doesnt work ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly this top is not soft or flowy it is stiff and very wide
1134,1.0,plz dont buy it after month black lined coming on display
1135,4.0,very pleased the alexa voice is so terrific you guys really nailed that part and it sounds even better through the doti have a charter echo from the invite my only complaint there is it cant hardwire to an audio system but the dot canthe review would be stars if amazon would relent and allow itunes to play through the echo i understand why they dont want to but i still dont like it id be happy if apple and amazon coagreed to allow exclusive things in both of their products no stars until that happens
1136,5.0,im writing this review after using this sd card for almost yearsvery nice sd card im using it from almost year
1137,1.0,unmounts randomly in mu surface pro seems to mostly be centered around write operations trying the samsung version which is sadly much more money
1138,4.0,processor is slow generally batteries will not have longtime really its light weight
1139,5.0,liked it
1140,3.0,loved the idea of this topbut it just wont work for me its really big im and lbs a small should be fine but im swimming in this the back is pretty i tried it on with a white cami but it looks very maternity on me tried to order the xs but its sold out too bad was a cute idea not too thin for summer
1141,1.0,replacement k baad phone m charging problem h kya yrr cell phone dhang ka nhi bhej the isse phle wale m otg kharab that bad experience with amazon
1142,3.0,love the knit color texturebut oddly a short and boxy fitand sonot flattering
1143,5.0,i dont care because i like be it so much but make no mistake it is not black but rather a dark navy however please dont let this fall negatively on your decision to buy it its fabulous
1144,4.0,it is so beautiful to see
1145,1.0,worst speaker ever
1146,2.0,the phone hangs intermittently that hampers making and receiving calls not expected from a brand of this repute camera is also average with issues of image stabilization
1147,2.0,like the other reviewers i wanted to live this product i use the body lotion and wanted the whole line smelled nice without being overpowering lathered up nicely even minus the sulfates seemed ok at first but after a few weeks i noticed my hair was dry and the ends felt like straw and i use a leave in conditioner i have dry hair to begin with so maybe if you have oily hair it would tone down the oil because it does seem to take the moisture out of the hair over time live their lotion the shampoo and conditioner not so much
1148,2.0,avarage
1149,2.0,i ordered the black and white pattern which was ok i got a small but the shirt was very square with a short and wide fit i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt sent this one back
1150,3.0,i ordered this top online in two colors and kept the berry color i liked it while trying it on when i wore it an entire day the top just didnt look that good it wasnt flattering and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting it didnt seem very flattering i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase i wish i could send it back but i already wore it the fit just isnt very flattering it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy
1151,5.0,have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one i have a large g bust and its hard to find one without overly large lapels these are perfect and they stay down which is hard to find too perfect length beautiful color not too long in the back it has zipper pockets and the photos dont show the silver grommets on each side at the hem the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look
1152,4.0,display amazing crispy and clear display processor you wont feel any kind of lag with the processor fingerprint scanner fast accurate however i feel little hard for my finger to reach there camera excelent quality pics from regular and wide angle camera needs the improvement of night mode battery super amazing in my daily use using social media and playing call of duty it lasted for more than days
1153,3.0,of battery after bettery over heated and after mobile not charge full
1154,5.0,phone is good for daily use i am not a hardcore gamer i just took this device for display and battery
1155,2.0,i ordered the echo with the speaker and didnt get the speaker i paid for it but nothing big disappointment
1156,2.0,battery life is very worst
1157,3.0,i feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee its a lovely pattern and i like the fit its not clingy but its a bit seethough its not as bad as the other tee but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt unless thats your thing that said im happy with it because its a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather i am very glad i got it on sale though i wouldnt have paid full price for it
1158,3.0,this is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back i need to be able to move my arms freely at work so this did not work for me you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you
1159,2.0,tv is running properly main issue is with youtubeit is asking to upgrade to new version and when im installing it from play store then it is showing that new version is not compatible on this deviceand old version is not opening it is always asking to upgradethis is frastrautingi dont know how to see you tube on this tvi have restored it then also after few minutes it is asking to upgrade
1160,1.0,constantly says sorry im having trouble understanding right now amazon has replaced once same issues with replacement
1161,2.0,charger heats
1162,5.0,i love this phone cemera are so good quality and the best phone this price
1163,2.0,i am pre order booked but not received headset
1164,2.0,i love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering the neck line fits a little weird too bad color was nice though i returned the top
1165,2.0,phone heat up when use min continue online gameing camera not more clear phone temprature goes near to c its a wasteage of money to buy this product
1166,3.0,pos this is best budget phone for non application users sound camera and screen quality is good cons more application installed on this budgeted phone is not good battery backup is not good battery will not stay one dayif we use phone heavy
1167,3.0,unlike the taller version of echo sometimes echo dot cant hear me unless i am literally standing on top of it it kept saying welcome back wonder if it simply needs an firmware update
1168,1.0,touch is not working properly
1169,3.0,i was hoping to find a slimming and cozy sweater unfortunately this one was baggy and material was really bulky one of those occasions where i would have never purchased this in person but online you cant quite tell the style and fit i returned this item
1170,4.0,im quite surprised to see so many negative reviews on this product but i suppose i am just an outlier i love this product it works wonders on my hair and yes it does actually straighten my mermaidy wavy hair and does reduce almost all of the frizz trust me theres a sizable amount this being said i have a theory as to why so many reviews have trouble i only wash my hair times a week i think using this shampoo and conditioner any more than that would be too harsh on your hair and cause many of the problems other reviews are having on top of this i also try to wash my hair in luke warm water another preventative measure to reduce drying my suggestion would be to try out one or both of these options when using this shampoo and conditioner as i have had nothing but success from both products
1171,1.0,i was so excited to buy it online but it come in a small plastic bag and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got so i had to return it
1172,2.0,edit i noticed that alcohol denat is really high on the list one of the main ingredients amp though i dont use this any more since i ran out when i was throwing it away i noticed it maybe that was why my hair felt rather dry amp lackluster towards the end of the bottle i liked it while i had used it but i would not spray any form of alcohol the drying sort anyway on my hair when i am actively trying to heal it it may be fine for others with more resilient hair but mine is fragile so for this reason i lowered the rating amp that i would not buy it again drying alcohols should have no place in a heat protectant original this was the first product from this line that i bought but forgot to create it since there wasnt a listing thanks to the other reviewer that did that reminded me to post my own review anyway i really liked this as well i do rotate it with my few other flat iron sprays since my hair isnt entirely fond of protein so i dont want to use an excessive amount usually i just scrunch my hair into its natural wave but since i have fringe bangs which dont hold a wave well i flat iron them this is always what i use for that as well as regular touch ups when i flat iron all of my hair i love that it doesnt feel sticky provided you dont use too much amp even though i do regularly flat iron my bangs i have not seen much if any new damage the part i did have was from my dye job amp has already been cut off anyway the keratin in this probably helps with not causing any more damage amp really protecting the hair shaft it really leaves the hair nice amp shiny but since ive also been using my new john frieda day straight that leaves my hair even more shiny so i use that more often but on the nd amp rd days when i have kinks in my hair i use this to protect the hair im touching up the bottle is a bit awkward but i didnt have too many issues with it since i turned the spray head so that i could hold it easier mine didnt leak unlike the other review on here so i dont know if some are just a bit looserdefective but i guess trying to tip it upside down would be a good idea in the store before you buy at any rate its not too expensive around at walmart at walgreenscvs so it wont break the bank like some other flat iron sprays ahemredken alterna
1173,3.0,reviewing after months of usage laptop froze on opening more than tabs in internet explorer imaginenot a fast pc thats the first thing had to upgrade to gb ram for a good performance whereas my hp delivers a better performance than the asus before the ram upgrade i would recommend to go for an hp laptop at this price range with the money spent for the gb ram upgrade of around rupees
1174,2.0,this is called class so i ordered it figuring it would have useable speed i plugged it in to copy about gb of program installation files i was totally dumbfounded that it took about hours to copy those files onto this ultra class sdxc card gb on my superslow supercheap plastic schoolkid usb thumb drive takes less than minutes so then i tested it on various known computers with typical raw and jpg picture files read speeds ranged from mbs while write speeds ranged from mbsec for big files and below mbsec for small files this is what i would call largely unusable very disappointing
1175,3.0,its good oneafter using one year it can not charge
1176,2.0,i normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure but it at least fit well the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short
1177,3.0,i liked it online but i didnt want to pay shipping for something i wasnt sure if it is good when i saw one size in the store i was excited to try it on however it didnt quite meet the expectation the dress fits a little loose donna morgan size fits me better and it is not lined at all the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller i love the blue floral print but that is the o
1178,1.0,data monitoring is not accurate step counts are inaccurate

1184,4.0,im going on a cruise to the bahamas and when i saw this dress i had to have it i love it its soft to the touch and super fun to twirl around in the seams are a bit awkward and thats due to the bottom parts shape i have a slender navy blue belt that i pair it with to hide the waist seam and to accent my waist more a navy blue sashscarfribbon around the waist can do the trick too
1185,4.0,this jacket is just as stunning in person as online high quality and just overall fabulous design as much as i loved it though i couldnt get over the fact i was jingling every time i moved it seemed like it could cause piling issues and i thought it might get annoying wearing for an entire day i loved this and wanted so hard to keep it but i need functional chic pieces not noise makers anyways fit was great looked just like the model on me so i would recommend but with caution as for this

1202,4.0,these jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up the material is soft and they fit perfect they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise the only problem is that they are really long i am and they are too long for me which never happens so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels
1203,3.0,i ordered my normal size in this dress i am foot tall but the regular sizes were too large and too long midcalf i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline the dress is lovely especially on the models in the pictures but didnt quite work out for me also it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting ontaking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time

1205,3.0,the product retains the charge for long duration it charges also fast for mobile phones but while charging it discharges itself very fast i am using it for last month it is a good option to look for
1206,3.0,i put this in my samsung skyrocket phone even though the phone says gb max it still recognized and formatted the card its great to have all of that spacehowever any time i try to use the usb mass storage mode to transfer files it errors out i thought it was the phone since it was larger than the max spec but then i tried it in a usb card reader i had it still errored out trying the same files finally i had to put it in the adapter and stick it in a card reader built into a laptop and transfer the files that wayi think the issue was that using the usb the files were writing too fast and faulting out and with the laptop transferring the files from the wireless network and then to the card the transfer speed was slow enough that it was successful took all night to get my stuff on the card thoughi use it mostly for pics and video on my phone also works great the phone seems to have no trouble accessing anything on the card and it seems plenty fast for it even when recording high def video which i do a lot of for work

1214,4.0,i had both the shampoo and conditioner of this line and was disappointed that i can no longer find it in stores my hair looked and felt very soft and healthy with this shampoo it smelled fruity and wonderful and i loved the bright pink bottle i have somewhat wavy hair and this did not straighten it out too much or make my hair too poofy which a lot of products do if i could find this again i would probably repurchase it
1215,4.0,i love rompers and this one is really cute i usually wear size but should have got a it runs big it seems too long and im the prints cute but a little blah i paid which is too much since i havent worn it yet i should have waited for it to go on sale

1218,2.0,i really wanted to like this conditioner ive been on the hunt for one that would be moisturizing to my hair which likes to change from oily to very dry in a matter of a dayits very very annoying without being greasy with all the things i know about coconut being hydrating in general i was pretty excited to try out this conditioner i will say that it leaves my hair soft but the aftermath is a disaster no matter how long i stick my head under the shower head my hair will be piecey and unclean feeling when my hair is dry i usually try to wash my hair every two days or so but this conditioner made me feel bad going even a day the product packaging is the only thing i like about this conditioner although the wideness of it does make it a little hard to store

1224,4.0,i have used many smart phones of other brands so i compared many features and i liked this product of nokia very much some of the features that i liked about this product are the product is very cheap amazon offers heavy discount on this product this is the best smart phone with so much features and quality in this price range nokia brand itself is reliable so there is no worry that this product will hang after some time or it will worn down with time as happens with other smart phones year manufacturer warranty screen size is around inches which is comfortable and also large simultaneously memory wise it has gb ram and gb internal memory you can easily work with all your apps without the problem of hanging or switch off randomly sound quality of ear phone is very high dislikes the only major problem i faced is camera quality though it has mp mp rear camera and mp front facing camera but i am not much satisfied with the quality of pictures nokia could have done more about it overall this product is more than satisfactory in this price range i would recommend this phone if you falls under this price range

1226,2.0,doesnt do everything i was hoping
1227,2.0,i love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their off sale i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isnt even silk or a better material but once i got this i was so disappointed i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloontent on me i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way i dont even want t
1228,4.0,i have always love tracy reese products this blouse is really fun nice fabric and the proportions are perfect but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back the cut out dips low so i cant imagine a bra that would work with it its a s hippy themed blouse maybe the designer expects us to go braless unfortunately im going to have to wear a cami underneath it my girls need support

1233,1.0,after readying the reviews of this dress i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner boy was i wrong first this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o one size fits all sizing it did not embrace my curves at all the material was not as chic as i would have thought overall the entire dress was not flattering honestly i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it
1234,2.0,lags and flickers while sliding home screen camera quality is very poor dont buy this if you want good camera
1235,4.0,good working nice

1237,1.0,didnt worked like new laptop even day from the date of purchase it didnt worked well as it has very very slow performance and i contacted hp support many times but they did nothing and i myself tried to reset it and failed then gone to hp care and thry said that window is corrupted u have to pay rs for cloud recovery i have to pay for service even in warrantywtf is this worst experience with hp if you face u any problem on st or second day then pls return it other wise u will get irritated from hp service
1238,4.0,the phone is overall good and the price that i paid is really good as i got discount plus rs cashback in amazon pay as par as quality of the camera is concerned initially i was very upset as the camera doesnt give you mp quality but afterwards i realised that it can give mp with certain tc but the different modes in the camera is good if u can learn them faster it is better video quality ok so maybe i would give to the entire camera but real plus for this phone is the battery backup which is awesome and after an entire days of work with this phone which includes extensive internet browsing calling camera everything the battery still remains at around though i have not used in gaming so cannot say how that feedback will be fingerprint sensor is decently good but may not be the best face id is good so far
1239,5.0,i love this top im lb and the small fits well probably could have fit in the xs it is more fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom i ordered it in orange and it is a very pretty peachy coral stripe highly recommend for a comfy top that can be dressed up a bit more than your average tshirt
1240,3.0,i ordered shinco tv and received the damage piece inside the box even the packaging seemd roughly as you can see the tv panel was totally broken though i requested for replacement by amazon and was accepted for the same and this time the packaging was quit good and tight tv was safe outstanding picture quality and lot of features in an affordable price

1242,5.0,this dress is very cute the material is high quality and as others have mentioned it isnt jet black but more muted the cut of the neckline is very flattering and the pockets are definitely a bonus you could dress this up or down with flats or heels its very versatile it will be perfect for summer and in the evening you can throw a sweater or even a moto jacket over it definitely worth every penny
1243,3.0,guys the processor speed is to ghz so please make sure before buying this laptop we will face the performance issues while we are working
1244,3.0,the fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesnt flatter well the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some im very short and the length is great for me but im guessing not for the average height

1284,3.0,i heard about this shampoo in a magazine along with great reviews so i thought i would give it a shot i picked it up at walmart target didnt carry it for about i only bought the shampoo because i use a certain conditioner for my color treated hair i read the back of the bottle and it says that everything from the labels on it to the ink is environmental and compostable so that sealed the deal i must say you need to use quite a bit of this shampoo in order to get a good enough lather going i even tried adding some water now and then to get the lather going after using the shampoo my hair was really really tangled and i needed to use a lot of conditioner to finally detangle it the smell is great i absolutly love that but the rest isnt so great maby i need to use both the shampoo and conditioner to get the full effect but overall it didnt really work for me i must say im so in love with the scent that i prob will buy it again just for that but all in all there are definetly better shampoos out there for the price i paid

1332,3.0,this dress has a unique watercolorlike pattern and design and is silk but as another reviewer mentioned it is unlined so you probably would want to add your own slip the side slits come up high almost to the hip i am and bought the petite xs and it comes all the way down to my toes if i dont wear a belt if i belt it the length is more like one would expect from a maxi dress i am a little puzzled as to where i would wear this because the length and fancy sleeves make it seem more fo

1337,1.0,the photos dont look it but the one i received was a cropped length the bottom of the sweaters longest parts didnt even reach the top of my midrise pants and im so it wasnt that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are tall disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this

1352,3.0,one more budget phone
1353,4.0,overall good product face recognition is smooth camera is also good overall a good buy
1354,4.0,phone is good but the quality of material used at back seems like a average quality plastic when i hold my phone hard i get a sound as if i have pressed power button to volume key i believe samsung should improve that to be a smart competitor apart from that all features are very good happy with battery camera screen processing speed etc
1355,1.0,the product is really pathetic and i am repenting why i invested here the screen color changes keypads get on and off and many more things happen which are uncontrollable this phone seems to be worst in technology
1356,2.0,slim and light looks very professional little bit slow processing average camera nice sounds quality very slow and poor processing plz dont buy it
1357,1.0,i wouldnt be so unhappy if these pants cost about less they are so cheaply constructed one wash and theyre all but guaranteed to shrink the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer they are also inch inseam not as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them
1358,1.0,new does not work even computer tech could not get it to program apparently quality of amazon work should be improved
1359,2.0,i wanted so much to love this dress but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it the color of the dress green was lovely and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large but even at that size the dress was too large especially around the hips which for someone with an hourglass figure is saying a lot the extra fabric around the hips belled out some making
1360,4.0,i ordered these in eptites tey were a ltitle long still also a tiny bit on the loose side i am not sure i think they are worth as much as they cost so wil lwait for hte sale color combination was nice thougha dn the cut relatively flattering i jsut ahve seen better out there for hte price nice businesscasual pant

1366,2.0,this has such awful proportions im and lbs ordered xxs petite in the neutral color the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust it looks very unflattering and its very pronounced im only and already the seam hits at such a high point on me below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where its sewed and it balloons outward and is very square from there down very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi

1375,5.0,great sound battery life build quality also very portable love it would recommend to stretch go for this instead of any lesser brands from k above range
1376,4.0,all super
1377,4.0,i bought the white with the colorful stripes i am not disappointed the sleeves are rolled and tacked it seems to run a little big in the torso all in all a great summer tee
1378,2.0,i never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss first off its about sizes too big second off its knitted with a metallic thread that you cant really notice in the picture im usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient
1379,2.0,i ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event one petite one the style color and cut are all perfect one not so minor downfall however the zippers on both dresses were faulty they both broke in the same spot both during the first time just trying them on i cant get either of them to even budge now will either need to take back or get fixed very sad about this
1380,4.0,the dress is very pretty however the description is deceiving i purchased it not just for the look but because it was listed as silk but that is not exactly true the underslip is silk but the outer dress what you see is definitely not it is a cheap thin material on top skirt is stiff not loose or flowy as the picture would have you think i will keep it very happy i did not pay full price
1381,2.0,let me start this review by giving out of the stars i have yes i borrowed a star from a friend of mine to amazon amazon is the best always about the publisher amazing reads this is my first ever book from amazing reads and i am surely impressed a very well made book for a very modest price but there is only one thing that struck me very hard among the publication details of the book given on the second page just after the profile of the author there is a passage which goes on to say that this book is based on the copyright free version of the title and only uses extracted material from the edition of the original book this was a big let down for me for the following two reasons it is based on the original work that is a big disappointment i would have never ordered a book the purpose or the objective of it is to explain another book when that another book is a self help book in a way you are buying another book to help you with a self help book which is really weird though this could be my own issue it uses extracts from the original work is not this a dilution or may be aggrandizement of the points mentioned in the original work there is another element of subjectivity added in this book by the person who extracted material from the original work by adding fillers and materials to fill in the voids and gaps so that the whole essence may be there but the objectivity of the original author is lost may be the publisher should have put in the message on the first page rather than on the not so conspicuous second page which i suppose might not have been noticed by thousands of people so the publisher gets about the book the context in which this book was written was post great depression of or to be exact have the secrets to success since then changed do men need the mantras mentioned in this book to survive a fast changing environment embracing us there are many questions such as these which you feel rising within yourselves the moment you reach the crucial portions of the book while i wouldnt disregard the tricks and tips mentioned in this book altogether but some points seem out of place and highly irrelevant today also there is the fact that very terrible jingoist proclamations seem to be hidden in some passages which try to scream out of the pages the greatness of the american folk the rant against trade union movements also seem somewhat biased i am not particularly surprised since the author openly vows his support for the capitalist economy and all that it stands for i personally didnt seem to connect with any of the secrets to success mentioned in the book the blame largely lies on me since the book wants you to follow the steps mentioned in it to achieve all that it claims and unless and until you follow the book diligently the blame for your failures lies solely on youthe book is not entirely unhelpful some ideas here and there do seem to have an impact on you but on the whole the book falls short of the binding impact and force you would expect from such a kind of book this was my first self help book and i must say i have grown immune to them so like the heading if you have already read a self help book and found it useful go for this else ponder over the headline of this review
1382,4.0,great working memory card and speed is also good go for it
1383,3.0,it is ok
1384,1.0,the material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward
1385,2.0,this is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye the dyes in these pants are the same thing i wore the purple color and washed in cold gentle cycle and they were stained i will return these its too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants
1386,2.0,this white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra it seems very flimsy and poor quality even at the sale price disappointed and will return
1387,2.0,book syllabus is good but quality from amazon is disappointing
1388,1.0,this is my nd power bank purchase the first one being from flipkart both of them didnt last for long the first one didnt hold charge after months this one went defective after months i will stay away from mi power banks in future

1392,2.0,finger print sucksbattery is very average same with chargingjust an average charging speednothing so special about w chargercamera is okbut compared to my samsung camera experience this doesnt even near to comparisonannoyed by the fact that this phone has files other than galleryg g g is auto modewe cant select g onlyso thats another fault i found in herei hated a fact the most is while watching moving we have to on the auto rotate mode onand then when i keep the phone somewhere the screen switches it positionsi ama heavy movie watcheri find this very annoyingthey should have kept a hold auto rotate option to hold its positionoverall a handy phone for rough use
1393,1.0,product is good but mi service centre response is worst plz dont buy any products of mi if we face any problem service centre peoples are saying only one reason only ie physical damage wrost response ever from radiant service centre of mjameerpet
1394,4.0,purchased it just days before used since days only sound quality is very good as of now also noise proof hope it will be up to the expectation long lasting
1395,3.0,returned this speaker too small
1396,3.0,i ordered the tv which came in days time and the installation slot given to me is on weeks laterwad is the point of delivering it so early if the installation takes so long we cant even try to connect it as it says warranty would be void
1397,3.0,i was very excited to try out this dress ive been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now and im not digging this one the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat its cheap looking to me ive seen nice velvet and this is very shiny thin and slightly sheer the dress cut itself is what i was expecting a loose baby doll type dress the length hit above my knees the overall effect made me feel very gypsyishmy husband gave a firm no when he saw me walk out of
1398,5.0,it is mi satisfied
1399,3.0,i really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldnt even get both arms in i got a size small and probably needed a large but as far as the quality and color its really pretty just go up a size or two if anything and try it out
1400,5.0,heyyy you
1401,3.0,i tried this in my normal sp i found it to run a little snug but the neckline was way too low for everyday wear
1402,3.0,almost for everage use camera is also good but not in night security is not well like xiomi
1403,3.0,front camera is not gudnd bettery life is no longer
1404,4.0,this dress is a fun idea but the one i received had misaligned pleating so a few of the rows of sequins were tucked into the pleat it threw the lines of the dress off i ended up returning it but i think it can be amazing if you get one that looks like th stock photo
1405,5.0,the product is looking great better than its photos available online i have purchased this item because of its light weight gm sleek design and impact processor within budget it has no fingerprint lock but the face recognize lock system is great even in the low light camera and display both are ok recommend for daily rough use if you have some extra budget then i also recommend you to buy redmi or redmi redmi a is great for me because i use mobile hrs a day surfing google and its weight and design is absolutely perfect for me within low budget however almost every android phone is ok for the fist years afterthat you know what will happen to it
1406,2.0,i was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment it was overly large i was pratically swimming in it really love the design and the way it looks on the model just didnt work out that way on me
1407,1.0,there is no sim insertion tools and warranty card amazon help me
1408,5.0,good as excepted every thing in it love it cheersrealme pro
1409,2.0,camera quality not good batery backup is satisfied
1410,2.0,i found the fit of this dress odd i typically wear a or in dresses the fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge i am a c so i need some type of support i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store
1411,4.0,retailer is known for their unique designs and this one does not fail to disappoint i usually wait for items to go on sale but knew i had to have this one in my collection due to the fact that it can easily be worn with a pair of pants the actual shirt is a bit shimmery which you cant tell by looking at the photo i didnt mind it and thought it was actually a plus i just think it is a bit too expensive because although it is nice quality i dont feel it is worth the price tag pretty
1412,3.0,hi im purchas m mobile this mobile process is exynos not for exynos only box mentions process but mobile is exynos processor wrong processor this mobile sale mobile is average display is very beautifully designed for samsung no display screen protector flim no back case only plastic body back panel no notification led lights battery is one day average using this mobile android is running samsung one ui running this mobile
1413,3.0,i dont know if i was sent a petite by mistake but this is not inches long i realize it says swing dress but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough the weight would make it flattering on me as it was in realityshort and lightweight fabricit poofed out in an unattractive way too bad as the print is lovely
1414,5.0,love this ph good features with nice camera and battery
1415,2.0,i loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them unfortunately after washing the turquoise one it sprang several holes the same thing happened to the second one after one wash i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer and they have washed and worn great i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately very disappointed
1416,4.0,welli have completed months using m and here is my breakdown of pros and cons of this beast pros the best thing about m is the performances where i didnt see any lag so far the amoled display at this price is an icing on the cake the battery life is one of biggest saver for heavy users like mea fully charged m will last for one full dayheavy users some of the camera pictures i shot with m awe some of my photography fraternityi used to carry bulky dslr for street photographybut i stopped doing that as i started relying much on m for candid street photography android pie upgrades make the ui very easy cons the biggest cons is the fast charging claims they madeafter monthi realised it takes more than hours to fully charge the charging wire is too short which makes me think to purchase another adapter with lengthy wire this is not a beautiful looking phone compare to xiaomi and other mid range phones except for all these consi feel pros overcome and this mobile is a beast for any mid range phones lovers who feels to change smartphone every year
1417,4.0,cute and perhaps a little too innocent for my age because the petite was too high and wide on me fits great on my shoulderschest and the flare can be controlled with a layer and belt i already have a few ivory lace dresses that look age appropriate first try i dont think i have the right personality for this one looks great on everyone else ive seen wearing it
1418,5.0,first of all the photo online doesnt really do the colors of this skirt justice it is a heathered knit with colors of white gold deep yellow raspberry or almost maroon and teal i have never seen a color combo like this before and its really fun i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned or even navy or tan the skirt has a lining in it and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an
1419,1.0,display is not good enough and rest is the features fail to compensate for that what is the use of a mp triple ai camera if you can see its details on the screen if you can see you cant use the powerfull processor for gaming the grainy details of screen forced me to return the product amoled display with poor resolution is just sad to look at i dont know how they can go with ppi when its predecessor had better ppi highly disappointed
1420,3.0,i have naturally curly hair and dealing with dry scalp i mean this product is alright it does not remove build up on your scalp thats for sure but it was good while it lasted i tried to hurry up and get rid of it
1421,3.0,as other reviews stated this dress runs very large it was a big potatoe sack on me added to the fact that the green is much brighter than the online photos it is going back
1422,1.0,dont buy
1423,2.0,everything else is quite well except battery consumption which does not lie with the promised service that is upto hrs of talktime wireless and upto hrs of video streaming wireless at all upto hrs does not mean that actual time of consumption may be hrs rather it indicates a value that is nearer nearest to the stated value but according to the report uploaded herein my phones battery seems to have got damaged somehow many ones are suffering from similar problem apple said it is occurring probably due to not charging the battery for a long period now i want to replace this with newer one that is manufactured recently
1424,5.0,for the discount and little speaker the thump effect is goodvolumes also good a little more noise cancellation requiredtried just today lets see after time will give a review good speaker jbls good when its speakers
1425,3.0,i find a keyboard button issue but need a proper support to fix it now
1426,3.0,great looking shirt that i bought for my wife but poor quality the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug its really too bad because it looks great otherwise
1427,2.0,it takes alot of the product to really lather in your hair and i use this with the matching conditioner and my hair did not feel hydrated or soft at all its more like the opposite
1428,3.0,budget friendly decent phonerecommend to everyonejust some software glitchesthe brightness is not adequate in outdoors too much reflection and the camera works dramatic indoor lightingits just too bad indoors
1429,5.0,in the fall i purchased every single color of the left of center swing top long sleeve great colors and very easy to wear when i saw these i swooned these are very similar knit to the left of center but the swing is bigger and the linen insets on the side make this easy top even more beautiful these run true to sizebasically you are only fitting your arms and chest this top will definitely has a little give with wear which will just add to the shape and effortlessness the linen ins
1430,5.0,gave it to my friend as a birthday present delivery was okay and the product is original it came with a secure one time code that we could use to check the originality of the product on the mi website
1431,1.0,its been months the tv was working fine all of a sudden the display went partially black on raising a request to mi service center their technician visited and said that its a physical damage which is not covered under warranty so ill have to pay for the new panel i bought this tv for k i asked the technician to explain me how can a tv which is in such a good condition you can see i have not even removed the factory plastic can get spoil he said something might have fallen on the tv i said if something has fallen there must be some marks scratches etc but he wasnt be able to explain i called amazon they assured me that this issue would come under warranty but nothing happened mi service center started blaming me that i might have done something wrong ps lost one loyal mi fan pathetic service and product
1432,3.0,good phone under k
1433,5.0,the photo of these is truly misleading they are a beautiful vibrant print see the closeup photo they are much longer on a regular person they come a few inches above my ankle and i am there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each like a pleat that really allows a nice flow these look great with boots flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large not lined but drape beautifully there are pockets sewn closed upon purchase and pack pockets
1434,4.0,rating is enough to explain
1435,5.0,this tiny marvel does what it claims the only possible problem is that it is so small that you may lose it if you happen to drop it during handling but with gb capacity you wont be handling it often
1436,2.0,the pattern and colors are very pretty and the material is soft and silky i returned it though because it is very lowcut in the front it comes down to between my breasts which is not going to work for me
1437,1.0,defective product
1438,4.0,mi led better than sony or samsung because of rate difference and feature wise
1439,5.0,best ever book
1440,3.0,camera quality is average fingerprint is average battery is very good
1441,4.0,beautiful detail in the bodice but im either too short or its a bit too long for me have not yet decided if i can keep it material is elegant details are beautiful
1442,2.0,its going hang and restart again and again
1443,2.0,it was working very good for months i didnt use it regularly only used times now it stops charging after minutes later for starting charging device and one of the output port is not working properly please tell me how tk claim warranty i didnt received any warranty card in box
1444,3.0,i have mixed feelings on these i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture they are true to size cute and comfortable i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas im not sure if this was a bad lot but back to the store they went
1445,4.0,fits true to size good quality style and length
1446,3.0,not as expected
1447,2.0,i saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy unfortunately this dress is huge it is a rectangle with pockets i bought the xxsp my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with methis dress was beyond alterations too bad it was a great idea but no
1448,4.0,there are basically no disadvantages and disappointments experienced till now in addition there are many cool animations and features which are really impressive choosing over opt isnt a bad choice
1449,1.0,not even one month the pin is already broken not sure whether this is an original product or not so think before u buy
1450,5.0,good book
1451,3.0,great fabric but unfortunately it did not look good on me maybe on a tall person im only really wanted to like this
1452,4.0,all is ok
1453,3.0,this is a really lovely thick creamy sulfate free shampoo great lather cleans well and smells fantastic it isnt harsh and does leave a nice shine on my notoriously curlyfluffy hair one warning for people with colour treated hair while their website says this shampoo is ok for colour treated hair it most definitely is not it will strip colour like no tomorrow and you will see a difference after a single wash with it its curious as otherwise it seems a gentle shampoo but whatever is in the ingredients is a serious no no for those with colour i deducted points for that fact if your hair isnt coloured this is great stuff though its on the pricey end for a drug store shampoo and locally runs about more than some of the other shampoos from the organix brand
1454,1.0,price is tooo high
1455,5.0,very nice and attractive look camera quality is good
1456,5.0,i have purchased one plus on prime day i was surprised about amazon delivery services i got my mobile with in hours from order placed i got mobile very safely and navy blue is awesome in looks and style i fell love with this colour coming to the product price worth for price battery hrs camera awesome capturing photo is much good than compared s finerprint sensor faster than old one plus device speakers dual stereo speakers awesome
1457,4.0,this chambray halter top is a good summer staple from cloth and stone but it is better for longer waists than mine and smaller busts fyi c broad shouldersback short waist normally i wear a m in cs and that is what i tried in this halter top oddly the overall length was okay but the armholes were very low in the m the bust area was tighter than it should have been for a easy summer top i think that this is due to the overall length of the bodice in other words the top ha
1458,1.0,expensive and not worth it it does lag quite often and hard to program with third party applications
1459,3.0,online this top looks fabulous but in person not so great great color nice quality for a lightweight top but when i tried it on the neck does not lay nicely too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck and i love cowl neck i found for me it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest so didnt work for reference im and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large i purchased a smal
1460,3.0,this top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo and i am short at cute top but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style
1461,4.0,good sound quality
1462,3.0,i liked the product shots of this cardigan but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of unimpressed the green wasnt quite the color i was expecting the fabric was rougher the lace was scratchy the fit was boxy and the sleeves are very dolman none of which translated through the pictures online i still think its cute but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting i might reconsider if it hits sale but for now it goes back

1475,4.0,right on trend easy to wear but a bit snug in waist which the vendor gave item specific sizing to make the selection of the size a bit easier
1476,3.0,this vest looked so cute online what you cant see however is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe about wide that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didnt lay nicely also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open again showing the cheapy material that its lined with fits true to size i usually wear a sm in retailer and purchased the

1481,2.0,i requested for product replacement as soon as i listened to a song using this headphone the bass quality is not good treble is way more than the base which i dont like at all my old headphone is way better than this one maybe its because they are of same brand and so theyre more compatible with eachother but whatever the case im replacing this item to order the previous headphone and also if the headphone jack is slid even a little bit a disturbance noise appears which is another issue

1513,1.0,these are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not like the description says which is the only reason i gambled on these it is
1514,3.0,overall the top is cute what doesnt show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulderneck area the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck the neck area doesnt lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck ive never seen pleats placed in such a spot ruined an otherwise cute top
1515,5.0,this is a such a cute top can be dressed up for work or worn more casually very flattering im and lb i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more tunicy bought two colors

1518,5.0,good product
1519,2.0,its been more than a week since iam using honor band being honest my expectation was bigger for honor band so i chose honor over mi band by paying rupees extra iam thoroughly disappointed by the product here are the reasons notifications are useless you can jst see some thing has comemost of the time you cant read it properlyonly very little detail step tracking shows lot of false counts when travelling by a vehicle sleep tracking is only relies on accelerometersit is a play of probability not scientific readingif you take a long nap travelling in a bus it wont consider you as sleepingie it can give you a lot of errors spo reading is a fancymay not be useful for everyone music controll is laggy the biggest problem i faced with this band is the battery lifethats the reason why iam posting this review even with all features turned off including the tru sleep monitoring i hardly get days of battery life which is truly disappointing however iam contacting customer care for this terrible battery life
1520,3.0,display camera couldve been better
1521,5.0,great tv for this price segment and the nice amazon packaging
1522,5.0,cool battery backup is not so great as they telltold mobile performance is best so far but amazon you have need to improve delivery speed try to deliver at leat for the day of estimation
1523,2.0,battery life hour
1524,1.0,i have been looking for a nice white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all maybe because i am petite but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat who wants that so sending it back
1525,5.0,bought this to wear to desert trip this weekend when we see the stones dylan mccartney who roger walters and neil young think its the perfect outfit as it definitely has an s feel now if only i had a pair of brown or teal boots it would be perfect ill keep hunting
1526,4.0,good
1527,2.0,very poor picture quality and battery backup very poor
1528,2.0,the fabric is soooo thick the pattern is very springsummer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me
1529,2.0,fits very strange odd cut does not look well on
1530,5.0,sucha premium looking phone it looks much better in real than in the pics the screen is very punchy sound is crystal clear very sleek phone loving it altogether the battery backup is good
1531,4.0,i tried this top on with a pair of white shorts half tucked and it looked really classy and nice the fit was loose but flattering it is a tiny bit sheer but i was wearing a magenta bra so perhaps i am biased overall i think this is a good basic addition to a summer wardrobe can be worn with a nice skirt or with jeans as shown here the or xs cant remember fit me at lbs with dd chest
1532,3.0,picture quality bahut sahi hai but kuch samay bad slow ho jati hai
1533,1.0,i bought couple of honour phones earlier and i was pretty happy with the quality and features of it most importantly it was not getting heated up on the battery side however iam disappointed buying this one as the phone is continuously getting switched off just a months time of it purchase need to raise it back to company for motherboard repair
1534,4.0,its nice but you go for redmi pro redmi pro is only it was very nice gbram gb rom
1535,1.0,there is no hologram mark on the booki think it is a duplicate editionmoreoverquality is very poor and letters are too small to read
1536,5.0,budget phone nice
1537,2.0,i dont find this book very useful it involves only guys talking throughout and you will be bored after few pages i really has some outstanding principles but it was not linked to good examples throughout the book robin sharma stresses you on waking up at am going to gym spend time with family and the cycle repeats in every chapter the good book should make you laugh feel pity cry and that impact should last at least for a week that piece is missing in this book but i was really touched when julian talks about his family and especially his beautiful daughter
1538,4.0,better performance but camera quality can still be improved
1539,3.0,the micro sd works great as described but beware that the micro sd adapters are faulty the micro sd will get stuck in the adapter you will have to carefully rip apart the adapter to get the micro sd out thus damaging the apapter
1540,3.0,i ordered this in a small petite with tracy reese i never really know what to expect in terms of sizing im ft tall about pounds im in between a petite and a petite depending on the brand broad shouldered slim hipped and very short waisted i found this dress to fit a little large it was quite shapeless on me though i did like the wide scoop neck im sending this back sadly quality is nice though a bit thin for winter time
1541,4.0,its a very nice phone but a beet problem is it use to hang sometimes due to its low ram that is only gb which is not suitable for such dual camera phone and also a android version phones
1542,4.0,i bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it when i tried it on the fit was fine but it just lackedsomething the back was a little bit too long the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after gorgeous fabric and top but not for me i wanted something more for bought the velvet tunic instead
1543,1.0,why first pages of this book is missingplease make sure before delivery whether all the pages in this book is presente or not im fully disappointed
1544,4.0,battery is good and overall perform is good but sometime it gets hanged for some seconds and get released but its not big problem
1545,3.0,the device worked fine initially for days then started connectivity issues sometimes alexa itself says i am not connected to internet while system shows all ok when contacted customer care problem remained unsolved rest is nice sound quality is good
1546,1.0,worst mobile phone
1547,2.0,i ordered this after reading through the reviews i realize the reviews were mixed but thought id take a chance unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress right i loved the various colors yes it shows black but is actually brown i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semiattached to the dress with the same hitolow hemline wrong as said by others the sleeves were very tight the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model it isnt real
1548,3.0,mobile is little bit hanging and little bit slow performance camera sound light weight look etc these are good points about phone but performance disappoints me
1549,4.0,not bad
1550,1.0,half of the pages were blank
1551,2.0,disappointed the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs
1552,5.0,works very well by itself for older ears
1553,1.0,this looks so cute on the model doesnt it i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants but it looks cute that said keep in mind the model is probably feet inches tall im feet inches tall and this jacket came down to my knees im not kidding the length sleeves were at my wrist so more like sleeves im normally a size in cartonnier jackets but this only comes s m or l the medium is really a size which was too tight across the shoulders and
1554,1.0,the worst product ever only in days its mic stopped working
1555,2.0,battery backup is very poor i have used this item after days of delivery and then i realised that its battery backup is very bad but i have no option to return this item
1556,1.0,overall not satisfactory battery below average camera below average fingerprint average speaker very bad like old chinese phone
1557,5.0,the cons first sometimes the bottle isnt filled all the way and the cap breaks the pros very high lather faint scent good cleansing power excellent for keeping hair soft if you prefer a gentle clarifier this works some shampoolike the very clarifying but sometimes too potent aussie volumecreates tangles but this one doesnt interfere with my curls in fact after trying it tonight i think its a keeper im the cheapest person with shampoo but this one is worth the extra few dollars it removes product without destroying your hair and the clear geltype formula is great for those who dislike heavy creamy shampoo
1558,4.0,so good
1559,1.0,i am very unhappy with this product wish i never bought it its good for only music in long run cant even give my baby correct information for general science questions and other necessary info
1560,3.0,im normally between a in retailer dresses i had to go up to a size just to get the buttons across the chest to close and lay properly without feeling like i would bust out definitely not for those with any kind of chest
1561,3.0,this is the only heat protectant ive tried and to be honest i dont think its anything groundbreaking im sure its responsible for saving my hair from getting fried in the flat iron but it doesnt improve my hairs condition as it claims im kind of just using this up mainly because i love how this product smells like coconut cream pie i find myself sniffing my hair randomly throughout the day to be honest i dont smell any unpleasant alcohol scent like others have mentioned but maybe my nose is not the keenest anyway im content with what this flat iron spray fulfills but im still on the fence whether id repurchase just because i know there are so many better products of this type out there
1562,1.0,this phone is so boring sometimes hang battery backup is too bad sometimes fingerprint sensor is not working
1563,2.0,if you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person i bet you arent going to be happy with it for a phisique that is and lbs this dress is not too short however the back key hole design is just not flattering i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so
1564,1.0,book not received but payment done
1565,5.0,nice loosefitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall i had no problem with the slip being too tight lbs and went with my normal size it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders its great with boots or flats
1566,3.0,this top is beautiful in color and fabric unfortunately just didnt work in the breast line gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly im not really large in the chest area b but the large just didnt work had to send it back
1567,5.0,this shirt is exactly what i expected it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great its the perfect shirt for summer loose fitting but in a flattering way the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors i highly recommend it
1568,1.0,there is a line under the screen of te phone again there are some things written on the charger which means someone may have returned it to you after buying it lastly the device did not come with ear piece
1569,1.0,i put this in my galaxy note ii and put a bunch of music and pdfs on it i also used it to save videos and photos it worked well for about months then on christmas day today it said that there was an error reading the card and the card was now blank my phone no longer recognizes the card and even putting it into its adapter and sticking it in the sdhc reader of my laptop doesnt workif this is sandisk quality then i am not impressed i am going to have to deal with their warranty replacement but id rather have a refund than get another card that might fail after months
1570,2.0,do you want to spend minutes articulating the most basic commands to the ether great this is the puck shaped plastic tormentor for you when you want obscure alt rock blasted when you ask to turn on your living room lignts the echo is perfect seriously this machine is junk ive given up on the voice command ever working and just went back to using my various phone apps it cannot accept the most basic commands like connecting to my phone or turning on my hue lights it just spins then says ok without anything happening at least i feel better about amazon spying on my every conversation since this device vasnkt comprehend basic english
1571,2.0,the dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well if you are going to try it probably size down sizes for reference im and lbs i bought my normal size and it was very large i would not recommend as its just not flattering i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as im an retailer devotee
1572,1.0,card has failed several times in the phone i installed it in i purchased it for the phone where it has resided for a month in that time it has required reformatting three times which makes its utility useless as a storage device
1573,4.0,connectivity issues with mobile and laptop
1574,3.0,i love love love this absolutely stunning dress the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver and when it finally went up the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much
1575,4.0,didnt like its touch screen everything else is good
1576,2.0,this style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it however it is seriously overpriced i ordered the white and the material is thin and seethrough the small was even a bit roomy lbs dd going back unfortunately
1577,2.0,i got frustrated the same thing over n over of eternal happiness and younger looking skin definitely not my pick for a good read
1578,1.0,never seen so worse product from xiaomi ever screen is worst functioning is not at all good finger print sensor is very slow heating too much returned the product within th day
1579,4.0,great summer pantsnice material easy to take care of im and usually wear a size which i purchased the neutral they might be a little bit loose but they fit great and best of all they truly are slimming i love them so much that i just ordered the greenhard to top the sale price
1580,5.0,everything so good guys
1581,4.0,the print on this dress harkens to the old days of retailer if you miss the fun prints and whimsical styles playful textures and conversational pieces this dress is for you at c waist i bought the size runs tts site claims its a fit and flare but i think its more of a sheath cut the thicker canvas like material has stretch but gives good form i wear mine as a jumperpinafore with a white shirt sleeve blouse my only complaint is that as a dress the arm holes are a
1582,2.0,volume is very low was expecting similar volume as the echo but maybe less base very cheap sound from this speaker amazon also has a long way to go to make the usability of alexa fit more customer needs they could do so much more with this but its not being done
1583,5.0,very good mobile in this price range good battery life nice camera very nice results both of pics videos finger print reader is seamless good gui in camera lock feature you can list sos contacts also add your medical history mentioning here so it will help people use it gradient black back cover looks nice
1584,4.0,except one caveat camera not up to the expectation if you are really concerned about the camera not to buy this phone apart from that body is solid and indeed robust
1585,1.0,the phone was dead on arrivalnot getting switched on
1586,2.0,every single time i was in a store this dress caught my eye there was never a large or xl to try on however so when a free shipping offer came up i took a chance and ordered both the xl was too large the large was much better but a little snug so if it shrunk i would have been out of luck if i would have kept one it would have been the large however they are both going back a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger but on a body it is
1587,3.0,not so good camera quality battery drains quickly
1588,2.0,mobile is getting hot when kept charging and mobile using g net
1589,3.0,google home is better
1590,3.0,seems like a good value but as yet ive not gotten to actually use minei bought it for a contour camera without realizing that was apparently known to be incompatible found that out afterward on contours forum the device itself will support microsd up to gb but there is something about sandisk ultras that doesnt play nicely unclear what exactlyso im sure its great but you might want to check around to make sure your device will support the thing
1591,4.0,very prompt delvery on th placed the order and the product was delivered on th there was no user manual in the box though it is mentioned in the box no ear phones too wide screen good photographs this is the first impression more on using the phone for a week or two it looks good now battery with mobile data lasts for day picture quality is good
1592,4.0,not too better for high gaming like pubg other wise its good
1593,4.0,the only problem is built quality however acceptable pros display good processer camara battery cons built quality network problem in jio and airtel both network im not getting full network and sometimes internet stops working nothing else
1594,2.0,with very less operating frequency there is network connectivity issue with this handset in same place same g sim when inserted in other phone showing full tower but in this handset showing less tower and net speed going down people buying without ignoring the drawback clear cheating and not recommended for buying in my personal opinion
1595,4.0,good phone works well no issues found if one want to buy definitely go for it
1596,1.0,product good but amazon service is very bad not responding for any defect on product so dont buy and dont increase amazon sales and service
1597,3.0,so this is still a pretty cute shirt but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt it doesnt seem to be defective just a different version of the shirt im curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have still deciding whether to keep or not no more left in xs to place another order and see whats up i do wish it had the ruffle in front as that is what caught my eye
1598,3.0,i give this unit stars cause i expected it to have a lil bit more as far as it intelligent capabilities i think for its time it ok but can definitely use more for their are other products that can absolutely do more
1599,1.0,unable to download please check and help me to download
1600,2.0,not really
1601,5.0,this top is beautiful and unique but also i predict it will be high maintenance with the sleeves definitely have to be careful with the delicate sleeves
1602,5.0,i can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste its wide and not tailored at the waste the key to super cute fit is to size down then it will look like it does on the model in the picture i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture its super adorable in person the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate

1622,3.0,i found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline however the fabric feels cheap and doesnt drape as nicely as id hope for the price this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric for sizing reference im lbs dd and took my usual size xs though im busty for my size the top provides nice coverage
1623,5.0,i love this dress its so comfortable and perfect for the summer fall transition it fits true to size and isnt to boxy or tight i love the colors as well
1624,3.0,havent found any defects till today the sound is clean and not overexposed more ideal for using inside a room but who would like to buy a portable speaker to play only inside a room battery life can be an issue for those including myself who plays it at maximum volume but with the volume at to it would easily last a day it takes pretty much time to get fully charged overall its a good waterproof bluetooth speaker for the price i bought at

1658,3.0,let me start by saying this did wonders for my hair i have never tried a product that made my hair softer smoother or straighter it seriously got rid of all the frizzy flyaways and left me with silky soft hair that smelt delicious but after a month or so of using this my neck started to itch terribly and a blotchy red rash appeared i was devestated i tried cutting this product out of my routine to see if it was what was causing the irritation and the rash went away one day i was having a terribly bad hair day so i put this in on my way out the door bad idea i the burning rash was back i have no idea what ingredient in this prodcut caused the rash but i had to stop using it if you dont have sensitive skin or you are willing to put up with a rash if one occurs this is a fabulous hair product if youre on the fence i say get it because its so cheap

1680,3.0,this is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking however if you have shapely hips and backside this will definitely emphasize that had to take it back a little bit much for work and other formalprofessional events however if youre less endowed in that area it might work well gives a great shape

1687,2.0,this shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips the fit at the top is tight i ordered a small but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller i am it hits at a place that is not flattering i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings this is not italso the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting

1711,5.0,im using ms from last days and i would like to share my views battery life i would say this is the main feature of this phone it has milli ampere battery which easily last up to days for normal user like me and if you are a true gamer or watches more videos or use it extensively then also it will easily last for hrs of continuous usage display in this price tag it comes with super amoled display which is really awesome and the display you can compare with some of samsungs flagship phones like s or s plus camera camera is also awesome you can record k videos with super steady mode front camera is also decent it doesnt add extra colors in the picture as some of the phones does rather what i feel the pictures are really natural performance it has samsungs most efficient processor and it is really awesome i didnt observed any lag or frame drop while playing heavy games sound it has decent sound and comes with mm jack and you can also take advantage of dolby atmos which really enhances the sound output overall if you have a budget under k then this is the one of the best or beast in terms of battery options currently available thanks
1712,1.0,dumb
1713,2.0,i have several throughout the house to voice control nest thermostats and caseta wireless light switches the most convenient usage is setting timers in the kitchen however i give it a low rating because its so quiet even on max volume you cant hear the alarm over the vent hood fan even the gas flame sounds louder
1714,5.0,this sweater sold out fast at my local retailer store you know that stuffed animal that you owned when you were a kid and you would never let it go because it was so soft and snuggly yeah it is like that for me its a bit pilly but thats what sweaters do size petite s fit me perfectly i am ftin b waist hips hem falls inches above my knees sleeves fall right at my wrist and it gives room for wearing a sweater or turtleneck under it hood lays flat horse print is so cute
1715,3.0,all are good except the battery battery is poor you have to recharge your phone twice a day not for pubg players
1716,5.0,great top a little large but i shrank it a little in the wash and it fits a little better now i love the structure and pattern of this top as well as the lovely coralorange color it can be dressed up or dressed down love it
1717,4.0,this green dress seemed more fitted and tailored on the model i ordered a small and medium in the green and mint even though it says mint its a grayish blue usually im a medium but even the small seems a bit big it fits more like a loose boho dress rather than how the model wears it the colors are vibrant and the embroidery is nice i will be keeping both colors in small and just have to accept that the fit is similar to a looser casual summer dress if you look at the pics that other c
1718,4.0,the fox print is super cute and the reason i ordered the skirt sizing was true to me im usually an and the fit fine the waist is high and if you try to wear it low the side zipper puckers out in a weird way skirt length is above knee im skirt is lined but the lining is dark brownblack same as the waist band in the photo of the model wearing it the lining does not show at the hem its concealed overall a fun aline swingy skirt for late summer that will go into fall
1719,1.0,my remote is working its top part is working but the volume control is not working we purchased the same from croma in may now croma says its amazon product so we should contact amazon and amazon says u purchased from croma to go to croma but v r suffering nobody is listening to us pls help on

1724,4.0,good mobile phone as per budget with awsm but it does not come with earphones jack which is painful sometime and battery backup is also not so good
1725,1.0,i bought phone considering good exchange price of my existing phone but this phone is very poor in multitaskingeven if you toggle in apps it gets hanged
1726,5.0,i got this on a offerso its worth the money good sound and really portable cant ask for more for such a small sized speaker
1727,1.0,after a small preasure while trying to remove it from a device it got brokenalso the io speed is not amazing even for a class
1728,5.0,great phone came is awesome and battery life is also very good
1729,3.0,love the colors and design however the sweather is much boxier than what the photo shows and it is itchy i am still deciding as it might be fine with a shirt worn underneath it
1730,4.0,i experienced the with every wired and wireless jbl earphones that one of the two speakers stop working after months
1731,2.0,iam using this phone from past weeks and writing review based on my day to day usage pros good battery life speed charging hour charging give u more than a day cons display is not as on the papers not crisp display when you compare with mi a and other band products of same price performance is not good for gb ram but really good for day to day usage camera is average even though it is mp clarity is not good day light photos are fine some details are missing you can observe it when photos are zoomed in front cam is also average one good thing is wide angle capturing is good in both video and photo i have purchased by seeing brand as samsung and good battery capacity but not up to mark like other competitors
1732,1.0,poor battery
1733,5.0,this dress is so comfortable and looks so good i love the low back and the swing in the skirt i ordered the tangerine which is really more red than orange this is a simple slipon dress perfect for traveling as it doesnt wrinkle i will wear this often when the warm weather arrives
1734,3.0,everything is perfectbattery capacity should be better
1735,5.0,i like the echo dot and use it for information and setting alarms and getting the weather report however my wife refuses to talk to this device wont tell me why setup was easy
1736,1.0,very wrost product battery drain very fast also its operation is not easy as compared to other voice not reachable in weak signal overall very bad experience
1737,3.0,if you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you i wanted to love it because of the material and ive been looking for a blazer jacket that was heavy in weight this just looked awful on me maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut
1738,4.0,super phone with smart looks and very good battery back up phone gets charged very quickly very smooth operation only problem is camera cause photos look too much edited and too much beautification but ai camera dose very good while taking natures photo take little while getting use to phone as screen is big
1739,3.0,its ok it does shut off for no reason or it wont find the music i want and just wont respond
1740,4.0,there could be no other earpiece than this in the budget but there is one minor defect as the mic has no longer efficiency it took around months on my last buy also coz now i have two of these both these ear pieces has been left with no mic working properly
1741,1.0,defective piece going for returnhangs up speaker problemin a new set disappointed
1742,3.0,this product was pretty much useless as a conditioner it did little to nothing for my hair and for all its promises and its price i expected a lot more its only good quality was its heavenly scent which was pretty enjoyable it smells all vanillaey and reminded me of cookies and cake batter which was divine but unfortunately the smell faded pretty quickly once my hair dried
1743,5.0,very best
1744,4.0,awsum novel by preeti shenoy
1745,1.0,in hand set restart issue in the time off rebooting hand set is totally dead
1746,2.0,this is a good quality shampoo unfortunately i couldnt get past the fact that it smells like dirty pool water
1747,5.0,nice phone
1748,5.0,one of the best bt speaker out in the market awesome bass
1749,1.0,i had bought similar cables over a period of time however all the cables stopped charging at different points in time however on logging a service request they provide a replacement in weeks if the same is in warranty period however even the replacement cable also has failed while it is rugged and does fast charging all of a sudden it stops charging highly not recommended product boat needs to take stock of the situation immediately
1750,3.0,its just ok very thin and feel like it might say and stretch color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted
1751,3.0,in normal lighting the rear camera does have a hard time focusing and defining the edges in the bokeh mode pictures lack a bit in sharpness but keep its natural colours images in low light do end up having some noise even in night mode coming to the video the videos will end up with noise in low light but the super steady mode is pretty good on continous g mobile data usage with adaptive brightness the battery will last you for abt days exluding hrs of sleep
1752,1.0,zero
1753,4.0,so far running good but little bit noisy
1754,3.0,this shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line but unfortunately i had to send it back it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back had it been inches longer it may flare out but based on the length on me it ended up looking like a shrunken tent for reference i am with a long torso
1755,1.0,i ordered this in a size which i thought would be a small and it was very very wide it is very short too i typically wear a small and am and lbs its going back unfortunately very soft material though
1756,2.0,the cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didnt flatter my shape i think it would work better on someone very thin the crisscross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didnt sit right even worse the bust portion made me look flat and im a full c cup
1757,3.0,just so im clear the only reason i said it runs large is bc of the top portion but the bottom or waist loved this romper when i saw it online it was however too big in the top portion the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it gaps too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day also bc im the small was just a tad too short definitely no bending im tall lbs with an average size chest c i ordered a small and the bottom
1758,5.0,i really like the style and cute stripes and i love the versatility of the design of this shirt fits true to size and hides my stomach just in the right places

1790,4.0,in the quest to find comfy cute casual tops i took a change on this one its cute but quite oversized it just overwhelmed me i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model the style and color just didnt suit my coloring or body type but i still recommend because its comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone elses closet

1906,4.0,at the time of this review i have had several amazon echo dots year theyre not as loud and clear as papa echo but still very handy for the most part i ask for impromptu measurement conversions in the kitchen weather reports or dropin on my wife in another room its immeasurably useful to be able to add items to my shopping or todo list as i think of them i love how new skills and functionalities keep getting added the entire echo line is a constant work in progress and i love that im not stuck with what i bought because improvements are ongoing the only hiccup ive run into is for some reason in my home with both a g and g wireless network the dot occasionally loses connection in a particular location the rest of the house works fine though
1907,2.0,didnt work well
1908,1.0,i bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket basic goody binder and there is a circle stain where the binder was so strange i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them they are ruined i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them
1909,1.0,dont buy this watch it it is a very poor watch it is trap has broken dont buy it
1910,1.0,i bought this camera nikon d single lens kit from local dealer at very reasonable price nd saved almost yes this is true always compare prices at local market place and online market before you buy something buying genuine product for authorized company dealer think twice before purchase
1911,2.0,i ordered this blouse online bc i couldnt find it in my local stores once it was on sale the fabric is so delicate the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn had to return it
1912,5.0,the print is even better in person true to size flattering fit
1913,5.0,amazingnowordsjust buy it paisa wasool

1915,4.0,we like the amazon products but our echo has had hard time hearing our commands very functional loke allamazon alexa products i do like the tap better sound is incredible on the tap
1916,5.0,if you are someone who enjoys all the elements and composition of the songband not just heavy bass this one is crisp loud of a space as big as an average hotel room or a sq ft bedroom connects quickly comparing the price and some competition thats considered above jbl as a brand one would feel absolutely no compromise in the product go for it
1917,5.0,good prfomce
1918,4.0,it is a nice mobile can be bought
1919,4.0,amazing product works perfectly as per requirement
1920,5.0,a sales associate found this for me at my local retailer i probably would have never thought to try it on i am and normally a size or a medium the size small was still too large so i ordered a size small petite it fits perfectly looks adorable on and is so comfortable i cant wait for the warm weather to wear it
1921,3.0,it looks so cute and i love the detail on this dress but it was not flattering on me light summer dress and that was exactly what i needed but i had to exchange it with something else
1922,2.0,echo is a great hardware product and if it was a stand alone product i would give it stars this review is on the pile that is alexa i have been using alexa for years and it is not getting better it is not learning and is near to useless unless you know its specific key terms examples alexa play iheart country station it plays iheart country not the same alexa when was the song released current song playing i dont understand that alexa what is the score of the washington state cougars football team it cant find the team it does not have a search engine tied to it like other competitors doplease stop buying alexa products until amazon improves their ai and learning ability of alexa google bixby even have better responses when it is not a keyword then alexa fyi i am from the us nw and have zero accent of any kind
1923,3.0,i loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets the fabric was a nice weight not too thin like lots of retailer tops i liked the top from the front however the back was way too long especially with the looseness of the style it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted it might work on someone taller im and lbs and i tried xs
1924,1.0,software problems dont buy this mobile
1925,4.0,everything ok except camera quality
1926,2.0,im normally a size p i bought these in a because i wanted a more relaxed fit i could barely pull them up over my calves i could get them on and button them but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw size up sizes at least
1927,3.0,connected to my venue
1928,4.0,excellent features by ip switch from android have doubt on ios product but its amazing to see the features interesting facts is its software camera but feel down on battery life overall its a speed machine
1929,1.0,
1930,1.0,within month the phones led got off now it is in service center
1931,1.0,i wanted to like this i really did i chose this because they do not test on animals ive been slowly making the switch as my old products ran out previously i used aussie but i missed the memo that they were bought out by procter amp gamble the smell of this is heavenly its just amazing i read reviews on here first so i knew not to expect any slip but to still give it a fair shot my main issue with this is how tangled my hair was every time i got out of the shower i have just past shoulder length curlywavy hair im not a baby about tangles either but this conditioner made me have to go out and by a separate detangler i could not get a comb through my hair without getting a massive headache i dont think everyone would have this experience because having curly hair has a lot to do with it but it killed it for me aside from that nothing about this amazing you do have to leave it in for the required time it didnt really have any affect on my hair same level of frizz same texture overall just very blah but for the price i think i can find better
1932,4.0,headphone is awesomebut is it refurbished onethere was no seal sticker on neckbandi hv purchased two same headphones one has seal sticker and there is no such sticker on otherwhy
1933,2.0,i really wanted to love these because i love my other steps but they did not feel or fit the same way at all i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me sadly these will be going back
1934,5.0,iphone is always star
1935,4.0,nice product trustworth
1936,1.0,waste of money
1937,5.0,full disclosure im six months pregnant as such this dress is perfect for me its soft and flown and i look like i have a cute bump instead of like im wearing a sack i ordered my usual medium based on other reviews and t fits perfectlyso it would have been too big normally
1938,1.0,i like the coconut milk scent but i actually hate this shampoo and conditioner my hair looks really frizzy compared to the other ones ive tried
1939,5.0,this is the first amazon product i have bought that features alexa and i am not addicted i absolutely love the echo dot a must have is the mokcao power and cordless speaker with battery base it makes a great product even better
1940,1.0,if you have redmi a and a than not go for this it having bug which makes phones to very slow there is big problem of call drop due to phone not to signal many times you are not able to call someone which is major problem in this phone
1941,4.0,it was nice i like it it has an adapter too awesome
1942,1.0,the headphone jack is not working in iphone s gold its just been days and its not working
1943,3.0,good product
1944,4.0,performance is really good but now realme c is better than redmi a due to large display
1945,5.0,this is awesome at the price you feel it a great deal
1946,3.0,it seems that the device is in surveillance mode sometimes ill be having a conversation and without speaking or giving the device a command the blue ring stays on not happy with that at all sometimes it says randomly sorry i cant help you with that when i havent even asked weird
1947,4.0,camera awesome
1948,2.0,the headphone jack and charging port are same and this particular feature is very uncomfortable and frustrating you cannot always talk while the phone is charging as the phone gets hot and you cant plugin earphones i dont understand how this phone is an upgrade from the iphone which was much more user friendly d touch is again an uncomfortable feature using which you need a support at the back side of home button to press it properly otherwise it might not work that makes it more difficult to take screenshots as well in iphone it was much more easier to press home button overall not satisfied and planning to return
1949,1.0,this phone has good display and good batteryrest all is badthe camera image quality is bad speaker sound is very low phone gets heated up on calls and during charging connectivity is very poor i bought this as a gift to my wife and im embarrassed because of that and with given history of updates by samsung i dont think it will be rectified anytime soonso in totality it was a waste of my hard earned money
1950,4.0,this is a lot of fun i use it to make lists and listen to music not to mention playing jeopardy
1951,3.0,picturing quality of front cam is not so good as it is only mp but rest all is perfect nd dis phone looks very good i am not satisfied with amazon because they didnt increase the price after the amazon sale
1952,1.0,nothing is working in android contacted amazon for return of product they played a nice game to skip the returning date now i cant even contact customer care also
1953,3.0,this dress is a bit scratchy but overall i liked the fabric well enough on someone blond and fair the peach color washes out a bit the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height im it looked a bit obscene the small otherwise fit me great i have broad shoulders small chest and and slim
1954,2.0,a bit too complex for the layman and boring at times dont buy if you are not really a fan of physics or cosmology overrated for sure
1955,2.0,display is not uniform dark spots on screen
1956,1.0,hi product damaged within months wrost quality i suggest everyone not to buy this product
1957,2.0,i love the material on these shorts unfortunately thats all i love the fit is awkward and im an easy fit theyre boxy in the body legs and a bit tight in the waist causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well sadly couldnt keep these just for the pretty fabric
1958,4.0,i am overall satisfied with the phone gifted it someone and is working all fine
1959,4.0,i love this blouse but after i got it i decided i really didnt need another white long blouse it was more of a want than a need very stylish and comfy with nice neckline i love retailer anything im obsessed with this store and every single thing in it even the smell just makes me happy when i enter the doors
1960,1.0,its worst quality dont buy mobile in amazon because all mobiles are damaged and not good my mobile automatically going to silent mode with in minute
1961,3.0,bad display quality and over beautified photos working good but not worth the price
1962,2.0,battery backup is very bad i want to return but amazon technician is not solve this problem and not return this item
1963,5.0,i loved the quality of iphone the touch screen is superb the feel and the ui response to touch is simply superb the camera has been really good specially the panorama part extremely happy with both the cameras the display looks more natural and soothing to the eyethe phone is really fast and till now apart some network related delays ive not seen any other delays which relates to the phones processing
1964,1.0,amazon lists this as a smart tv fully knowing that half of the apps dont workexpect the customer to read the description but why fool people by listing it as a smart tv when as on date it is not fully functional with all featuresthis is unfair trade practice and misguidinghoping someone will miss the description and be fooled
1965,4.0,definitely sandisk ultra gb microsdhc cuhs memory card with adapter sdsdqugaffpa is working as advertised im definitely happy about this product the price was definitely worth it
1966,2.0,this top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture it also has a strong chemical smell ive had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out
1967,2.0,the pattern and fabric are lovely but the sleeves are short unlike the photo so it drapes very strangely i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo had to return this one
1968,2.0,product not upto the mark as picture quality is poor
1969,3.0,seemed to work as advertised but my first one failed abruptly after one week my smartphone failed to see it but amazon replaced it at no additional charge the second one is still working fine my smartphone is a samsung sg
1970,1.0,i am a size and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous it looked like a pirate sack its unfortunately going back
1971,1.0,this product is very critical to handle i couldnt connect and use this product with my android phone vivo v i followed the instruction of amazon alexa which i have downloaded earlier please send me simple solution of this problem otherwise i have to return this product immediately
1972,3.0,too greasy for my thin hair and did not help with breakage smells good though
1973,2.0,bought this with the sea mineral moisture shampoo and deep conditioner and used all products up within months of purchasing the products from this line smell incredible like mixed alcoholic drinks and they do leave my hair feeling soft touchable and with just enough volume and control my hair wont oil up until i go a nd day in a row without washing my hair however with this conditioner specifically it would take literally a handful of conditioner to get my hair to feel soft and actually conditioned and even then this did not yield its promise of taming splitendsan unusually huge problem i had out of nowhere just prior to purchasing this system sure this calls for a trim but after that ill be trying a different conditioner also if i were to ever repurchase a conditioner from this line againand simply because it takes a lot of product to get results from any organix hair care line in my experiencei would skip this conditioner and just get tubes of the deep conditioner which actually has almost exactly the same ingredient list as the regular conditioner except for maybe things and its only oz of product i think it yields much softer hair but split ends are still rampant such a disappointment organix yet again
1974,5.0,ausam product go for it
1975,4.0,i liked that the same is of very light weight if we raise the sound to the maximum the sound starts to quiver a bit other than that good product
1976,2.0,the camera quality is very low the back cover is low quality and main thing is the body has some hollow gaps specifically in the edge which makes button press sound when pressed
1977,1.0,quality very poor
1978,3.0,only the problem is displaybut not issue much more othere wise owsome mobileinhand fill is much primium i am a one hand userso its very comfortable for megood phone u should go for itas per u r requirement
1979,1.0,utter crap if you like living in disillusionment and with a false sense of security and high worth buy it not recommended for people who think
1980,3.0,gets hung sometimes and camera quality not so good
1981,3.0,i was so excited to get this dress i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front they didnt even try to match up the fabrics it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back so sad
1982,1.0,this top was very cute but super short and i am a short waisted petitie personthe waistline hits above your belly button looks very silly
1983,1.0,bakar phone
1984,2.0,i agree with the other review the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made the fabric is not sheer at all and great qualityhowever the shirt is very wide i am a and the small is way too big the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance
1985,1.0,very bed product you are tell this is redmi original powar bank but this quality very bed and unused less you are making fool and direct sale local product and tell original redmi powar bank plz dont purchase this product
1986,5.0,this top is really cute my daughter tried it on and tried to take it
1987,3.0,great colors and not too voluminous lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc itll require a belt or something over it looks v casual alone and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc its a huge piece of elastic ive literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it lol but its not worth it at the current price
1988,4.0,i like this smartphone very mach for displaybattary camara
1989,1.0,poor product easly crash by itself dont buy it
1990,4.0,the only negative about this dress was the placement of the stripe across your stomach
1991,4.0,the fabric and detailing of this dress is of superior quality but unfortunately it runs huge you definitely need to wear a tank or cami underneath i am lbs with massive shoulderssmaller bust and i got the xs petite
1992,2.0,even after several calls no service support for installation
1993,5.0,this top is flowy fluid and comfortable the material is like a stretchy crepe its thin but not sheer well i bought the bright red maybe white is sheer oh speaking of bright red well it is i mean it is the most vibrant red the photo online at least on my screen doesnt really do the red justice at all the fit is true to size the nice thing about this top is that it has movement and yet it isnt full of fabric and look like a maternity top and the armholes are not big th
1994,1.0,i earlier had a redmi note pro but i bought y so i have use dual sim battery used to last a little lesser it has been less than months of purchase the phones lower right touch screen is not working i use the phone very gently but this phone doesnt seem to even withstand for a couple of months oct it has been months and now one of the speakers do not work now the touch issue on the keyboard is back too major problems in months will keep posted for more
1995,3.0,this shirt fit really really big i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l if not a medium sadly its going back otherwise its high quality and a beautiful design
1996,4.0,this dress caught my eye in the store its lovely i dont think i wouldve ordered it its hard to see the charm in the photo but i tried it on because the colors are so pretty and the fabric has vintage lookfeel and i couldnt pass it up on sale i usually wear a but i bought an because the saleswoman said the sleeves run small and there isnt any stretch in the fabric both are true i tried on both dresses in that size because of color placement and to check on the sleeve size b
1997,5.0,this dress is as cute as i hoped it would be i love the pockets and length and flattering cut it looks great with boots and is perfect for fall only con is that it is dry clean only it seems like the fabric would do just fine with hand washing and i will probably go for it i just dont have the patience or organization for dry cleaning
1998,4.0,i really wanted to like this because of all the amazing reviews the first week it worked alright but didnt do much for my hair my hair gets damaged so easily so it needs hard core tlc unfortunately this did not work on my straw like hair but that being said there is a positive part my mom tried this and she loves it she had colored hair and it is somewhat thick it makes her hair soft and shiny
1999,5.0,perfect wanted a dress for a mexican vacation this fits the bill exactly fabric has enough weight to hang well and cover any flaws love
2000,3.0,dear team this is very disappointing that bill which was accompanied with mobile is not at all readable i would request you to kindly send copy of bill readable at the earliest
2001,4.0,all good
2002,1.0,i bought this ear headphone one month ago but one of the the earpiece is not working from last days since it comes under warranty period can you assist me in getting new one
2003,3.0,phone stopped ringing in weeks only vibration so unable to get notification for incoming any calls
2004,5.0,i waited to weeks for this mobile and every time i missedfinally one day i got this the best devicehight quality and ultimate mobile
2005,2.0,i ordered these in both colors the red is much deeper in person more like a burgundy than pictured here these tees are very slouchy if you wanted a more fitted look size down these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans the overall quality seems very good although they are thinner than i thought they would be they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos overall these are very nice but there is one is
2006,1.0,item has unwanted lines at startup screen also i am unable to update android version its android oreo with limited options it has updates before november while updating its showit unable to update nothing else
2007,5.0,i purchased the blue stripes and the black cat prints on sale and im very pleased they each fit me a little differently as the black cats fit tighter through the arms the stripes remain a bit looser throughout no complaints here i like the variation i ordered a size small as im normally a size small c lbs
2008,3.0,has a lot of i dont know that
2009,2.0,video clarity is very poor didnt expect this poor quality from samsung
2010,2.0,iam writing the review after usage of months initially it looks and performs very well i started observing issues after months of usage sometimes i got irritated with fingerprint sensor as it wont workperformance also sucks device with gb of ram and powerful processor sucks to load a single application it stuck very frequently after restart of phone we can see abnormal behaviour of device it wont allow to enter password sometimesonly good thing is better battery life and display
2011,5.0,allright
2012,3.0,i like this top but it does not fit me correctly i am and have a larger bust c this shirt fits in the length but is tight in the bust i would have to buy this in a medium i normally wear an xs or s the quality is better than most t shirts and i ordered the red the red is a deep and striking color and one of the better reds ive seen this season the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt the top cuts in and doesnt provide coverage my bras are not covered by this to
2013,1.0,i have been using this mobile for more than days ill give my honest review camera the company claims it to be mp but my brothers realme pros images are better battery guys dont be fooled by thinking it has a massive mah battery the backup is not up to the mark and it takes hours to charge display maybe the only great thing in this phone gaming plays pubg in hd high not not as smooth as a phone with snapdragon call quality i dont know why many youtube reviewers mention it it appears to be the same in mostly all new devices but there is one issue on this device guys as the mobile heats up or background downloading picking up a call in a middle of a game it becomes almost impossible to keep the mobile near the ear as the heat is very high my advice buy this mobile if u want a mobile with good brand value or else please save your money
2014,1.0,do not get fooled by the positive reviews the old saying you get what you pay for is totally valid on this product to start with the power consumption specification is listed as watts but this tv consumes much higher than that i purchased this for the primary reason that i would get extended time on my ups battery owing to power issues in my area the picture quality on a hd signal is fairly good but it is definitely not on par with other k tvs of reasonably reliable brands you will need a pair of speakers connected for good sound this tv will give you something that you can barely hear thats it wireless streaming is fast but picture quality of streaming netflix on this tv appears so grainy and of such poor quality if you cannot watch youtube and netflix on a k tv with reasonable video quality i am not sure what you can you have to see it to believe it and finally there is the issue of screen reflection during day time one of the features of led tvs is that panel reflection is generally very minimal this one will ensure you can see yourself clearly in all glory finally the build quality of the tv feels brittle and it is a matter of time something will go bust this is mentioned by several reviews on amazon and returns on amazon for items like televisions are a long drawn affair it is the first time i had to experience amazon doing something that is not mentioned in the returns policy thus prompting me to write such a detailed review they have arranged for a technician to validate the above quality issues and only then will accept a return or replacement request in my case i can only sit and wonder how a technician is going to ensure watts of power consumption from this tv when this inch tv is clearly consuming watts or more all though its onmode condition
2015,3.0,i ordered this in hopes of wearing as a tunic with leggings for my rehearsal dinner it is much shorter than expected and wouldnt have looked right with leggings it also was more gray than ivory and in the short time i had it on was shedding lint like crazy beautiful in photos but didnt work for me
2016,4.0,i love this tee but there is a lot of swing fabric so it can tend to make you look wide also i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side im still undecided on whether im going to keep it bc its rayon poly and its hand wash only and im worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and its already short rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware
2017,1.0,its quality is very poor price is so high
2018,5.0,superb product a simple tv can become smart tv be smart and save your money
2019,3.0,good sound quality for the price range some other brands give a much better feature for the same price and quality
2020,2.0,belated delivery and phone is dead now within a one month how can an apple iphone can be dead without any physical damage it is jolting
2021,3.0,im quite happy with how this works for my colortreated very dry hair especially given the affordable price planning to try one of their conditioners and im a sucker for vanilla scents edited this vanilla became overpowering for me almost like milk gone bad after a few days i just couldnt take it anymore
2022,2.0,the laptop is slow you cant multi task things laptop is for a basic use like watching movies and stuff cant install many programs it will slow down
2023,1.0,totally vastage money hanging issue and voice picture quality not matched
2024,2.0,this product is alright although the smell is amazing the actual product is pretty mediocre it has a very strange consistency similar to jello but it doesnt really bother me ive found it lathers pretty well and i get it at walmart for about which isnt bad to me at least it didnt leave my hair greasy it actually felt pretty clean but after a few washes it didnt clean my hair as well and my hair would get very oily super easy i have pretty long about rib length hair thats naturally blonde its pretty thick but i have fine hair so i have a lot of hair but its indivual strands arent super thick does that make sense anyways this shampoo is okay but i probably wouldnt purchase it again if organix is reading this just know if my hair had that scent after it was dry i wouldnt care how the product was i would use it everyday just so i could smell my hair all day so maybe work on the longevity of the smell if anything lmao
2025,3.0,ones get it going it fun found a way to link to my smarthome fibrao so that makes it even better sadly i cant get time and location correct because of limit in amazon support why why why so if you need this part to work dont buy it
2026,4.0,its a good mobile but the price bit high nothing much difference in camera as same as battery also same just one day of use
2027,2.0,looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person runs very small i returned it
2028,3.0,top is very wide and flowy i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering would be very cute with the right body shape
2029,2.0,i bought this top in black it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back however not only are the armholes are too large the shirt is cut too short if i size down for smaller armholes it becomes a crop top not a flattering look for something me i really wanted this to work but alas it went back
2030,3.0,i am sure these pants are right for someone just not me i am wider in the hips and they just were really unflatering the fabric is very lightweight which i wasnt expecting and so while the pleats are interesting with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place the waist was also much lower than i expected not low rise but im used to thinking high waist with wide legs in short these pants are probably great on some body types just not mine also very long im and a
2031,5.0,this is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned and i am kind of a dress person this one has beautiful detailing sheer sleeves but the bodice and bottom half are lined fits beautifully i am a little busty so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress i am and the length was just right abou
2032,4.0,pros good v handy good sound cons not great sound hangs if it is fully charged but there is a way to get over it
2033,2.0,really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews even with the sale price and addtl discount its basically blouse fabric with design and detailwork of a much more expensive blouse the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily if it were black you could probably get away with it but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle sad to have to send it back
2034,3.0,the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than id imagined from the photos it has a quilted quality so doesnt drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms i typically wear a size and ordered the large i think a medium might have been better havent decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like
2035,2.0,oh i wanted this dress to work i bought it in green red and the solid blue all ran really small i just fit in a when i would normally take a in retailer sizes and lbs as with many other reviewers i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw it took a long slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations such a cute style was really bummed it didnt work i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot but they wer
2036,1.0,it did not work my friend ordered jbl months back and the battery is already not working well
2037,3.0,i have been looking for a basic ivory sweater i waited for this one to go on sale the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy unfortunately i decided to return it
2038,3.0,nice sound and quality of sound is very good but after using it for days all the programs such as rocks radio micro sd cards what is corrupted and we can only use the bluetooth
2039,5.0,nice in thus price sagament
2040,2.0,usually wear s and xs tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way two layers green on outside and a polyester beige layer underneath but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket
2041,2.0,theres nothing smart about this tv netflix amazon primevideo donot work with the tv unfortunately i found this out after purchasing the tv the interface the google tv interface is an absolute pain takes a while to boot and every task is time consuming when the tv is switched on the home screen opens by default from there it is required to switch to the desired source the remote there isnt a mute button on this remote are you kidding me xiaomi even the source cannot be switched or the picture settingsbrightness cannot be adjusted without going back to the android home screen on the plus side the picture quality isnt bad and amazon music hotstar do work definitely would not recommend instead buy a decent non smart led tv and a chromecastfire tv stick to go with
2042,5.0,im pregnant nd trimester and really wanted a beautiful nonmaternity dress i got this in ivory and its just perfect the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable i love the fit and i love the length i got tons of compliments on it my only regret is that i didnt also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get restocked

2047,3.0,this sweater looks soft and flowy on the model but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didnt lie flat way too expensive for what you are getting
2048,3.0,i thought i would take a chance even though reviews suggested tricky sizing issues unfortunately its true it was very tight at the waist and bust even though i sized up to a size i took it back to the store
2049,1.0,phone touch is not working properly
2050,3.0,i have not tried everything yet but i live in medina new york and it does not recognize my town somewhat limited for me
2051,3.0,i tried this dress in an xs my usual size and it is tts i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty however the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me i didnt get the dress and wished it worked out
2052,3.0,my mobile gets heated quite quicklyalthough its having mah battery battery life is too poori have to charge my phone times in a daysometimes i get message from samsung that the phone is heated up although its it hangs
2053,2.0,no proper support dont buy mi products for small fall the display is gone
2054,2.0,battery back up is very low not good as s
2055,3.0,note this review is addressed to that class of people for whom rs smartphone is once in five years thing before you judge the rating which i have given and draw conclusions i just want to let people who read this review realize that i am after technology with some innovation and out of the box concept as i never use a smartphone beyond months in this process i literally used every highend smartphone that was launched after iphone g my first hold of a smartphone be it xperia blackberry samsung nexus htc what not now coming to the point of fake ratings i am a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews for an iphone on amazon kindly see flipkart without the product even launched on their site there are ratings and as much as stars out of and not a single review i am enclosing a pic for your reference so there is something which doesnt catch our eye but these are the lame tricks that get played when you go neck to neck in competition it applies to either side about apple undoubtedly i give huge credit to apple for introducing smartphone concept and in the process they slowly killed the once mighty blackberry like thomas edison credit goes to apple for inventing such a masterpiece but we are still not using the same bulb which edison has invented there are so many companies which are reinventing bulbs every year apple followed it up for few years with some changes in iphone to keep the customer base solid there is so much hype created over every apple launch and in the process the adversaries tried to copy the launch styles of apple so they clearly have the margin but they are surely lagging behind in terms of innovation this year iphone is one thats a perfect example coming to the phone watched the launch event so closely like i always do every year i was using an iphone and was waiting for i have had an occasion to handle and experience both iphone and plus even before they were launched in india and finally ended up with galaxy s edge for a reason before commenting reread what i have written in the first two paragraphs of my review i opted for s edge for its curvy screen design with brilliant colours and the camera which beats the iphone the dual camera on iphone plus is not new to the world before its launch secondly they have their eyes set for the th annniversary of iphone in and are holding their cards till then both ios and android have their own pros and cons this is the area which i am carefully and deliberately side lining and focusing on the phone this year launch of iphone is only for those geeks unlike me who actually stick to iphone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt honestly as most of the apple users agree what matters is the design of the phone if i see a person standing about feet away from me with an iphone not plus and me holding my iphone a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone not talking about brand so if i were to shell rs for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years i better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iphone but loses the battle and with rs cheaper i put my chips in there unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like games its not worth an upgrade or a first time buyl i would request people to just think a bit before investing your hard earned money to go for iphone join the line in which i am standing for the revolutionary design of an iphone in because thats when apple is gonna show again to the world that they are masters of innovation all the best
2056,4.0,value for money do buy
2057,1.0,redmi a has lag problems this phone is hanging and lags while using youtube and browserredmi a is far better than redmi a i am not satisfied buying this product
2058,4.0,great watch with great functionality goforit
2059,4.0,not tuff enough will be destructed with small span
2060,1.0,got this phone last week posting this review after a weeks usage the phone is getting heated even with normal usage camera quality is waste simply cheating people mp will take better pictures if you are not bothered about heating and camera go for it worth the money else is waste of money i regret for this purchase
2061,5.0,a perfect mobile under budget
2062,5.0,overall its very good mobile and got it for best price with exchange and liked
2063,1.0,not gud
2064,5.0,best price and high performance
2065,5.0,i was a little nervous to buy these because they are such a statement piece but i love them they are so comfortable which is rare for jeans they create the optical illusion that i am a super model so i will wear them as often as possible very flattering and comfywin win
2066,5.0,this jacket is perfect swings just the right amount without looking too big
2067,1.0,since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short im it also is too big the empire waist has no shape or flatter the sleeves are huge the neckline was falling off my shoulder i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong the print is very fun and my guess is thats what is attracting everyone to it it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me back it goes
2068,1.0,before you start reading i want to tell you that i have used this powerbank for months now and i know the down side of it earlier i also believed in star reviews that power bank is good but all became clear after st encounter with service center within months my power bank stopped working i contacted nearest service center but they didnt accepted the warranty since there is a big scratch over the powerbank i asked several whats the matter with scratch which is on the bodythe powerbank has stopped working so there must me circuit related issues but i end up doing emails to higher authority and they did nothing verdict dont trust mi company you will know the harassment when your own power bank would break and they are ready to bully you
2069,5.0,best i like it
2070,3.0,this dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my its a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for
2071,2.0,this skirt is very pretty but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized so theres very little stretch for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements theres no way to get this skirt on past the hips
2072,3.0,a good mobile working well but mi mobile are always of more ads so occupies many space thats the big problem other than that its working fine
2073,5.0,apple phones need not strive on reviews they are just amazing small machines
2074,4.0,love this top red color is a bit orangey for my taste but overall a fabulous piece
2075,4.0,all good need call recording
2076,2.0,when i read car coat i expect a little more weight it really is just a thin long blazer also the colors appear different online i expected a redmaroon with bue and white stripe so maybe i misread completely it is actually brownmustardbeige combo not what i expected so it will be a return
2077,3.0,i have the st gen so maybe nd is better but i find that the dot and i returned one got a nd that does the same thing doesnt hear me i have to yell at it especially if the volume is a little higher very frustrating
2078,3.0,i really love this top but am afraid i may need to return it because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it and they show really badly as black spots because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads it feels so good on though you must be super careful with it i have no idea how the little snags even got there
2079,1.0,system is very lag disappointing
2080,5.0,this is my second purchase happy with its performance
2081,3.0,this top fits like shown in the pictures however i bought the rose color and thought it was a little off would have loved to find the ivory in my size
2082,1.0,this dress just fits weird maybe it works for somebody there is a reason it has been put on sale
2083,5.0,best ever is iphone xr but my camera was more better then expected wonderful purchase and the phone is almost the best of all
2084,4.0,the embroidery on this top is pretty but i think blue is more of a navygrey in person and the embroidery seemed darker brown im and tried an xs and small the small definitely fit better in length the body of thr blouse is loose almost boxy cute top just not what im looking for
2085,1.0,price high
2086,3.0,i am about with an athletic build i was so excited for this dress to arrive when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it the color was as pictured on my computer i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short it was huge on me too long too wide too frumpy too loose all over i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was boo i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter
2087,3.0,tldr an okay product designed for people with low to moderate phone usage frankly speaking this is a mediocre product at best the camera is okay the sound quality is good the battery life is poor however this phone sports a simultaneous dual volte standby at the cost of extremely heavy battery usage and phone heating note that this product does not include headsets
2088,4.0,i am very happy with my echo dot she tells jokes plays music answers questions about movies and actors there are a few things that alexa says i need to buy an extra app for her to be able to answer or some music i need to subscribe to music unlimited that is why i didnt give a star review i dont feel i should need to buy a trivia app or special music app for information i am having fun just asking random questions
2089,3.0,nice book
2090,4.0,a very good phone under rs range value for money
2091,1.0,camera and battery is not good
2092,2.0,i felt the texture was really thick it wasnt easy using it in the shower you have to squeeze hard to get product outso this isnt my favorite one in the line i am not a huge fan of coconut smell eitherso this was just ok for me i prefer the blue one the morrocan argan one
2093,3.0,i bought this on sale at the same time as the brazilian keratin dry oil and i preferred those oils on my hair slightly to this one this was ok but i didnt feel i needed both so i returned it the bottle design could be a lot better to prevent waste and messiness but not as bad as some organix products
2094,2.0,i absolutely love mother jeans but i unfortunately had to return these ones this particular style seemed to run pretty small too i always size up in white jeans and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight i typically wear a in mother and ordered a in these
2095,5.0,was indeed an awesome product worth for money
2096,4.0,good one depends on how it performs in summer
2097,2.0,hangs like anything
2098,5.0,worth it
2099,4.0,this dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it didnt fit me right i ordered a small since i usually wear a size but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist i guess im just too busty for this dress too bad because i really wanted it to work it is a lovely dress
2100,3.0,sooo sooo poor quality of front and rear camera result its worst than nokia oldone kindly i request you not to buy this phone
2101,4.0,oh how i love the scent of this it makes me so happy i wish the bottles were larger or the price less because it really does not do anything for my hair other than smell good i would still buy this maybe just once a year when i want to take a long hot shower and have a little treat and unwind but because there is no benefit to my hair the bottles are so small and my hair very very long i have no other use for this but to make my senses happy and it does lol
2102,2.0,display quality is much below averageselfie camera obviously doesnt convey the quality of mp
2103,3.0,phone is decent regarding its price pointnice display quality and battery is also good but camera is disappointing camera quality is average
2104,2.0,got this in wine very pretty and soft but so sheer even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami returning for this reason having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultracomfort
2105,5.0,this is a very good product i am using it for since five months and it has given me good results and it is very hardy and accessible i will recommend it to all to buy this if you really want a good powerbank at a affordable rate thank you
2106,1.0,this is a total waste of money the face recognition stop working after day and continues to register your face again and again after each day otherwise no match i m just a regular user and cant get enough out of the features and dont suggest to buy it
2107,2.0,ok but not supporting pdf file seems amazon has delivered old product
2108,2.0,i really wanted to love this dress i love the colors and the design of the dress unfortunately i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant its so voluminous that its not flattering at all also agree that the lining is scratchy
2109,1.0,very bad exprience please dont buy it waste of money
2110,2.0,not working in month tried for replaced at mo store but rejected for minor scratches
2111,1.0,i simply cant donwload the application to set up my echo dot because it is not available to brasil without the application i cant configure the device and it becomes just a piece of junk disappointing
2112,2.0,my mobile speaker has more volume than this one dont buy waste of money
2113,4.0,loved this top bought it during the recent promo and thought the sale price more fair i sized up because i wanted a swingier silhouette and more room at the neckline the top is impeccably made and the embroidery is sturdy i did not find the top seethru and am wearing it with a racer back black bra and have no issues
2114,5.0,love this ordered this for my sons apartment at college small enough that he can travel with it as well looking to purchase the travel battery so he will not need to plug in
2115,4.0,it is my first experience with samsung phone phone feels premium in hand and white color makes it unique this new ms is very much impressive with its great performance with screen battery ram management osui and camera we can call it a premium phone in limited budget hands on experience is good not found any issues during day to day tasks gaming and battery usage camera is good enough some clicks are attached for your reference including night mode but i expect more than what it has i hope this camera quality issue can be solve in next software update here are some pros and cons that i noticed during my usage pros premium screen quality optimised ui for smooth performance good ram management great battery performance overall performance is very satisfactory cons front and rear camera is not that great as compared with same budget smart phone i guess this issues can be solve with next update
2116,4.0,beware ur going for a chinese product cons the screen gives me a bad eye fatigue despite trying many blue filter apps cant uninstall the system apps will force u to sync to mi cloud pros cheapperformance is good good finger print reader quality decent camera

2118,2.0,i had such high hopes for this product sadly it did nothing for my hair i also hate the design of the bottle which makes it very difficult to spray product in your hair no shine no bouncy no nothing points for the scent
2119,1.0,iphone sim card slot not working right from the beginning have already checked with apple authorised centre and according to them sim card slot is damaged they warned us against purchases from amazon really disappointed with quality of products that too when return option is provided by the website
2120,1.0,poor quality cooling stop after a month and now even cannot return the product
2121,4.0,these are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out for me these are dual duty pants casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms though the ankles are small they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft they work well with both my sneakers and clas
2122,2.0,average camera quality fingerprint not fast as redmi good in price range better than other in battery backup out of
2123,4.0,nice product usder low price overall not bad product if this review help you so vote it helpful review
2124,2.0,i wanted to love these jeans but as a woman who is almost there was way too much stretch in them i am always a size and i couldnt wear these they were way too tight they went back the next day i will say it could be my body type im a runner so my legs are muscular if you have very thin legs these could be great and work for you i loved the color dark blue
2125,2.0,smells great but the smell doesnt stay and it leaves my hair rather dry too bad im crazy about vanilla
2126,2.0,dont purchase for camera usage it is poor feeling worst with the irritating advertisement in regular intervals worth for the price if there is no advertisement
2127,1.0,samsung galaxy m is the worst product in that m series battery camera ui is not easy to use not connect easily in computer totally worst buy
2128,3.0,the sound is not near the quality as the echo
2129,1.0,worst experience after purchasing from kevin team
2130,3.0,i really liked the look of this top online but when it came i had a couple of issues with it first when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug i normally wear a m and thats what i ordered it makes raising my arms tough and as a teacher i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist secondly my husbands first reaction was that it looks like pajamas the abstract floralstripe gets a little lost on the other hand the color palette is very pretty and the qual
2131,3.0,nice product from xiomi amazon service also good
2132,4.0,i wanted some extra space in my new mobile device so i chose this sandisk microsd card the card has worked perfect so far in my htc one m for several weeks so far the performance of copying files from my computer over to the phone is adequate the performance is likely limited by the phones usb interface so i havent done any tests with the card connected up to a dedicated sd card reader
2133,2.0,the usb cable was defected not charging my phone at all i charged my phone with other charger and also not replaced by amazon bad service very bad
2134,1.0,fingerprint place is moving which isnot fixed to the phone battery is very badi received this phone with battery it took minutes to charge battery with fast charger battery is very bad if u people are looking m for good battery i suggest dont buy m
2135,5.0,as good as should be prompt service
2136,4.0,i bought the green and white and waiting to see how these wash based on previous reviews they are definitely not figure flattering and make you a bit boxy you could belt it but i wont ill just wear for errands and lounging better than my sports tees i bought mediums because if it shrinks a tad the small might be too short in the arms and i wanted a bit more arm coverage
2137,5.0,i have these in colors and i always wear a in pilcro i could probably size down but i like them a little loose they are great to have in the spring and summer they are very soft and very comfy
2138,4.0,nice displayeasy to readnot so comfortable in holding yet its ok
2139,2.0,i own other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material this one missed the mark not soft and very thick not what i was expecting
2140,5.0,great smart phone with some really cool features love honor very nice smart phone and the deal was also great
2141,1.0,ordered it on never received the first supposed shipments then days later an envelope arrives with a counterfeit sd card that was detected as fake with htestw software after writing only mbs it crashed several times no hologram or individual serial number on the chinese knock off packaging either make sure you know where they are coming from only buy these from reputable authorized dealers its worth the extra couple bucks to avoid this frustration
2142,3.0,there is nothing so special in this phone that people are mad after it apple is only popular because of brand value not for manufacturing products for the pros part great colour rose gold durable good speed not great compact beneficial d touch now let us talk about the cons screen colours are not vibrant processor is not the fastest hangs sometimes and if you dont believe me check on internet that the study in true that after you buy an apple device they slowly and steadily slow down your phone by major and minor software update so be aware an update is not always for good the biggest con the camera is very blurry and badi hate its camera more info about the fourth con this is not a rumor a complete and accurate study and only apple is this clever to force you to buy their only by name flagships other companies like samsung are honest and never do this bad practice in other flagships after around months the phone feels a bit on the slower side because the processor gets old by the time enough talking for today and again this is my honest review and not any practice of degrading apple please click the helpful button below the review have a nice day
2143,4.0,saw this jacket online and decided to search in store for it i found it and although it definitely looks more mustard in the picture online compared to the bright yello it really is i felt it fit very well it runs large i usually am a size however i ended up buying a size for a more fitted cropped appearance the material is heavy but made very well and feels great on i recommend this blazer for any female that wants to brighten her closet up for spring
2144,2.0,it was not too hard to set up but it only worked for about hour after answering a few questions about the weather and testing the timer function it stopped responding i restarted rebooted reset the echo it would come on and say hello but would not respond i tried all of the different names for the echo pressed the button to get a direct response from echo but would not respond seems like the microphone failed about hour of being set up alexa was kind of cool when it worked but failing after hour of use seems pretty poor i sent it back for a refund maybe next year they will improve the product
2145,1.0,have of these echo dots and out of work fine one however is now not responding at and have only had it for months tried to return for exchange but system will not allow if past days didnt last long tried all of the online help to reset it and with no luck just keeps cycling through the series of light combinations its a hocky puck with lights now
2146,2.0,material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though its a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits
2147,1.0,my mobile is defected and the side corner is defective and phone is not assembled properly i want to replace that defective piece
2148,1.0,definite disappointment with this product one of the worst hair masks i have ever used wouldnt even call this a mask at most a quotconditionerquot made my hair feel basic and decent after use i even tried using the product on dry hair damp hair wet hair etc doesnt work just dont buy the end
2149,2.0,the fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look i have a large chest but the similarly cut blouse without the textured fabric from the same designer fit me fine this one is just cut differently i even tried sizing up and down to no avail the photo on the model seems misleading because i dont see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone even with a smaller chest i was so
2150,1.0,this should only be used in very small areas the volume is extremely low i bought it to use in the bathroom and if you turn the shower on you can not hear anything and alexa is unable to respond to your request because she can not hear you
2151,1.0,i bought new iphone s in big billion days offertht mobile was nt charging mother board pbm
2152,2.0,i recommend this product but with the following reservations the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit i love the fit and make of the jumper but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day this is still happening after several washes which makes me feel disappointed it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely
2153,2.0,as another reviewer pointed out although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water the color around the popsicles will bleed this is extremely disappointing im hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover or that retailer will take this item back would only dry clean this item
2154,2.0,i have received the phone weeks agoin phone screen straight lines are coming on screen when it is on please refund or stop the emi payment or replace my phone its not a good experience to have defective phone for rs looking forward for your response
2155,2.0,very poor sound unable to hear at all very disappointed
2156,4.0,i will always buy this product it makes my hair soft and much more manageable i straighten my hair everyday and it makes the straight last way longer the smell is strong but if you dont use a lot you barely notice it after a while
2157,2.0,very appalling experience we have received a damaged door for the fridge we have even brought it to the notice of the lg associate who had come to give us demo about the product he had opened the sealed box and also took the pictures of the damaged part however we havent heard back from them we are not happy with the service provided it isnt worth the money cant trust products in amazon disgusting experience
2158,4.0,got it on offer so the price is reasonable considering the low battery lifewould not have purchased it at the mrp am enjoying the user friendliness and the speed of the phone
2159,5.0,best handset ever used good camera quality good fingerprint as well as performance is awesome
2160,1.0,this phone was lower processer and hang mobile
2161,3.0,i know rompers typically arenampt the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper etc and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i donampt think it is worth the price
2162,4.0,earphones are good i got it by an offer costing me worth rs bass is good but not great as you increase the volume you will feel treble taking over the bass the earbuds fit perfect got extra earbuds set as per ear size material is good the length is more than sufficient i am happy with the product as i got it in less money and its performing great at this price if you want this to work even better then use bass booster app you will feel real bass then after installing the app bass is far improved and treble issues are also eliminated
2163,1.0,i love most of amazons products this however i do not even use hard to set up and not practical i ordered two at the time and did not bother to even open the second one i also bought one for granddaughter and she had same issues
2164,1.0,very mc product bill is not available on this box and memory card and battery and mm lens both are not available on this product dont buy amazon is frod
2165,4.0,this tank is soft and flexible great fit with wonderful material very pleased
2166,4.0,loved the laptop no regret i searched a lot about budget gaming laptop and then ordered this for k and its worth the price no problem with intel optane or anything just reinstall the windows when you get this product to remove unwanted bloatware cpu temperature under heavy gaming c and normal c i will update this after using it for at least a month
2167,2.0,failure model as the built quality is very poor unlike samsung level and boalt for example its made up of rubberized material and neck band and volume button parts are not assembledpasted properly
2168,3.0,in this price range it is good
2169,2.0,do not buy this phone its an extremely overhyped overpriced phone going with the applehype i preordered this phone elsewhere used it for weeks extensively sold it b its too late to take a fresh breath of air keypoints as below very fragile back backglass shatters even from feet drop and then it costs above rs face id is not convenient at allits not secure as well as per latest data if front glass breaks it makes the face id unusable and then pay a bomb to replace the front panel ios is not optimised for this iphone x yet resulting in buggy sluggish performances better wait for next gen iphone x in us price is around inr including tax and indian price is rs for the gb model and similar price difference for the gb model as well notch kills the show while doing anything on the screen stainless steel rim is gimmicky and is highly prone to scratches even after protective cases worn crackling soundsthat can be heard when using the iphone x speakerphone at high volumes if you are a die hard fan of apple iphones then get the iphone plus you will less regret do not allow apple to make fool out of indian consumers just because i am not a verified buyer here amazon does not stop me from speaking and writing truth update though the hype worked for apple initially due to the phone itself being inferior the sales of iphone x has declined all over the world recentlyalso as per many reliable sourcescnet mashable bgr etcjust google it out apple will be discontinuing the production of this first gen iphone x in itself to keep its brand value once the next gen comes up
2170,5.0,bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and im obsessed like previous reviews mentioned it runs a little small in the chest im normally a medium but am a c so ordered the large and it fits perfect with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what its a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well
2171,3.0,i ordered this product because it is like similar to redmi note pro
2172,2.0,i ordered first the green then the grey in case the green was mismarked so short is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them but there is no way to lengthen them i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years they are a full inches shorter wow note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the models ankle thats how they are in real life i wear these pants in a tall and live

2174,3.0,i really like this dress but after looking at the photo it doesnt look like this well at least on me granted i am dd so that might be part of the reason but this dress is definitely trapeze style i love the look but am cringing at the thought that someone is going to think i am pregnant because of this a belt is a must plus it is the only way to achieve the look in the photos because it is a lot fuller in real life another nice touch to this dress is that versatility with the ru
2175,5.0,i use this card in a galaxy note and i have been very pleased with its performance it is noticeably faster than the class card i replaced i use it for storing and then watching movies and it plays them back with no observable buffering time it is also fast for writing photos or videos that i shoot using the camera on the tablet and the cost was among the lowest for cards of this storage size and speed class
2176,3.0,bad camera quality nowadays samsung has lost its quality
2177,1.0,it is a hanging gardenaverage phone nothing spcl
2178,5.0,like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer the lining however is not silk its rayon and sat weird on me it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless i do have a large bust i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will im keeping the dress the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture

2186,3.0,maybe if i sized down to a small id like them better they look ok from the front but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide there is exceess material in the back and leg hole they are not all flattering to my rear end overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling too expensive with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive for the lack of structure and simplicity
2187,5.0,this sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings sundrys lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool the fit is true to size the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along

2203,1.0,my phone is not working since it has been arrived complain done atlest times with the customer care but no positive response i think i am wasted mine k amazon is a brand but still no response even they are constinusly saying that we cant do anything in this situation very dissapoinetd this time

2207,5.0,i ordered this top despite the other reviews and im very glad i did it is adorable well made and very flattering i am usually a size xs or but based on the reviews sized up to a fits perfectly not snug at all highly recommend
2208,1.0,dress just did not fit will around the hips also the string belt was defective basically about to come off looks like someone may have wore it and returned it was not flattering at all
2209,4.0,best option for beginners little costly but has a worth
2210,3.0,this is a very cute dress it was perfect before i washed it the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two and since the dress is shorter i cant really wear it without using biker shorts especially for the back of the dress since its shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything im so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute ver
2211,2.0,a disgrace camera has become awful and the pictures clicked dont look real looks like a filter is by default on
2212,2.0,i wish this fit me better i love the inside fur it is extremely soft but it doesnt look flattering at all it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted it wanted it fit over my butt or cover half and it sits a little below my waist unfortunately i am taking it back great idea though
2213,1.0,it wont stay connected to my wifi network my echo does but the dot wont i contacted amazon support they were amazing but couldnt solve the problem they sent me a new dot it has the same problem my sister has a dot it has the same problem the next time amazon has a sale on echos ill buy one of them but no more dots
2214,1.0,i have been using google chromecast for over years now and ive never faced any issue with that product however it could not stream primevideo and i always felt that if i knew this before buying i would have purchased firestick instead few weeks ago there was a discount of inr on firestick so i thought of buying it while firestick does have a lot more features compared to chromecast it doesnt do well the basic thing that its supposed to do that is streaming from day when i played netflix on firestick the colors seemed washed out and the picture quality was not as good as i had been seeing in chromecast but i felt well maybe not a very big deal then came the streaming issues while casting netflix on my chromecast it takes hardly or seconds to start streaming at hd quality however with firestick it takes on an average seconds to buffer and start streaming and within a few seconds the picture quality falls back to poor this is with same internet connection another issue is frequent disconnections my phone and firestick are connected to same wifi network and while firestick says it is unable to connect to the network i can seamlessly browse on my phone with same wifi network also while playing video on firestick i frequently get popups about slow internet connection while i never get any such warning while playing entire movies back to back on my chromecast this product is a disaster and i would never recommend it to anyone i dont care about some cool remote and voice assisted alexa stuff its a streaming device and it is supposed to do its job of streaming which it does not i am so glad i chose chromecast over firestick years ago i can watch primevideo on my phone or laptop it is not at all worth its price i wont even buy it for inr ive placed a return request i hope amazon doesnt cause any hassle in the process
2215,4.0,book must be read very simple and good just love it
2216,2.0,face unlock is not that secureph is getting heat while playing pubg
2217,3.0,i do not know if it is the fact that i do not yet have a smart phone and therefore do not have the app necessary to help alexa do commands but i was surprised that even the simple questions of kitchen conversions she seemed unable to comprehend repeatedly mostly at this point i have her play music through my pandora account or tell me the news which has been great she is very friendly and aims to please
2218,4.0,great entry level dslr pictures arr aweome light weight compact dslr easy to carry and in good price range the thing which annoying is no bag with the product we need to buy it seprately design was also great all the buttons on right side which is great thing rest nikon nailed it with this small light weight easy to carry
2219,3.0,visually its a great design easy to use i do think theres room for improvement with the quality of the speaker and realistically it should be able to pair with my amazon alexa as a bluetooth second speaker why that function has not been figured out yet is a bit mind boggling
2220,2.0,mobile network not connectingd touch also not functioning
2221,3.0,i like the smell of this however you need so much product to get a lather and since this product has coconut oil you can breakout if it drips on your face
2222,3.0,its lags like anything dont know if its this particular piece but lags a lot bought it for my mother but with her light usage too it hangs call drops automatic calls to numbers

2227,2.0,i loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam on mine was crooked no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it sigh i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however
2228,5.0,was purchased to expand memory in a tablet it works well in my a tablet and can be used in a camera using the adapter
2229,3.0,i absolutely love my echo dot my only complaint is how okay the speakers are sometimes alexa being softly said across the room grabs the attention but the same volume of speech leaves her guessing where it came from other times i have her playing music at volume and i have to raise my voice so she can hear me i purchased the echo dot as a way to test whether or not i would buy an upgrade sadly i came to the conclusion that an upgrade is especially needed if i were to ever want these issues fixed
2230,2.0,the fragrances of organix products always draw me in but so far ive found the styling products soso i have fine wavy hair and a lot of it i used two pumps of this mousse worked it through from roots to ends and let it air dry i was pleased with the the way it brought out my wave pattern and that it left my hair soft not crunchy however i was disappointed by the complete lack of volume which i expect from a mousse if the delicious scent lingered i think i might have overlooked some of this products weaknesses but i couldnt smell anything after an hour or so that was a real letdown overall i found this product pretty lackluster there are more effective mousses out there in the same price range so i wont be repurchasing
2231,5.0,thanks amazon for fastest delivery a must read book
2232,5.0,this coat is gorgeous the minute i saw it online i ordered as fast as i can type when it arrived it exceeded my expectations in every way the lace detail is exquisite and the fit is so flattering i have the beatrice coat of last year and i so love it and this is equally beautiful a must for retailer shoppers i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection

2235,2.0,the design of this sweater is odd it made me feel very round when i put it on the sleeves were wide the other reviewers were correct in saying that its a thick sweater which i thought id like the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater
2236,2.0,dont buy
2237,1.0,this died so fast and i barely used it in fact i did not even put anything on it and it died my pad recognized it for a few weeks but when i went to put stuff on it it was deadcomplete garbage stay away
2238,4.0,i love the lace up design and bought the red xsp fabric is a bit thin and mediocre quality but over all happy with purchase wish this top came in navy and white as well even a navywhite stripe would be a fun option too thanks you for offering this top in a petite size
2239,3.0,camera is worst its like mp camera screen quality is not good
2240,3.0,these werent what i expected but i kind of really like them they have a very high rise and so they end up being high waisted the fabric is stretchy so they are extremely comfortable however the fabric is very stretchy and im not sure i can wear them to work but theyre a little fancy for the weekend the color is more of a washed out coal than pure black all things i can work with but they are a little different than i imagined they are quite long im and will likely have to
2241,5.0,i bought this dress instore and its fantastic im between a medium and a large and i bought a large because it was the one available and its fantastic some of the polyester is fraying between the seams which is obviously not ideal but im willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is

2248,5.0,awesome
2249,4.0,i have naturally curly hair but ive never tried it on my natural hair to be honest i only use this to straighten my hair which is about three inches below my bra line when straightened i find that it does truly tame the frizzies and makes the split ends far less noticeable however i cannot vouch that it actually heals them as the product claims this product does work wonders in actually achieving pin straight hair without it the results are much worse this product leaves my hair sleek and shiny and helps drastically to straighten it plus it lasts for most of the school day and smells great
2250,2.0,could not connect to any other wifi network poorest portablity and customer interference
2251,5.0,i absolutely love this top i purchase this brand frequently because the designs are simple yet unique and cool im lbs curvyathletic and i got this in a medium it fits perfectly and looks really great on i love the asymmetric cut and raw hem wish it came in more colors

2260,4.0,i purchased the dusty rose i thought the picture represented the color accurately the shirt material had a nice thickness and drape it felt very luxurious the opening in the front is cut a little low but workable in the end i am disappointed in the care information provided by the site it listed the garment as machine washable but the care label in the garment states it is dry clean only i would not have purchased it if i would have know that i am going to have to return it for this rea

2262,4.0,smooth performance touch is also great camera could be much better
2263,3.0,the best thing about this phone is samsung one ui it gives you a premium experience on such a low budgetabout its fingerprint reader its not that fast but it gets the job done and it have camera lens setup one is normal one and other it ultra wide yup ultra wide which is very rare at this point so u can take ultra wide clicks and battery life is the best at this price point having mah and it does support quick charge and the best thing is samsung has also provided quick charger with this there are no headphones included in the box itself you can use two g sims and a micro sd card expandable upto gb all togetherso my final verdict for this phone is if you want to use this phone for day to day task its a good choice at this price if you want to use this phone for playing graphic intensive games the cpu and gpu will get heated up after sometime

2267,3.0,i fell in love with this dress online i listened to the reviews and ordered a size up i got it in the mail and couldnt wait to try it on i was sad that to find that while it was tight across the chest and the keyhole in the back seemed to pull it was really large in the body in addition while the lace is beautiful it is very fragile i still think this is a great dress but definitely for someone who is small chested for reference i am a dd and size and i ordered a medium
2268,3.0,bettery life is normal sound quality is not good and not value for money
2269,3.0,phone is perfect with no doubts in it i would only suggest avoid jet black colour if ur very keen and concern about dust and scratches and finger prints anywhere please check the product once you receive and if you find any single dust particle n scratch please return it within days as that had impacted me because of amazon policies jet black is more prone to scratch finger prints and all possible annoying stuff battery life is superb and it lasts more than any other smartphones till date

2300,1.0,this is for the root booster not to be confused with the fiber cream the bottles are almost identical except for the nozzle this one has a spray nozzle with a cover so you can spray it close to the roots the instructions say to quotlightly mistquot onto clean damp hair concentrating on the roots you cant lightly mist very well with the type of nozzle but it is good for getting the product into the roots it is a watery solution with little to no scent that is easy to work into roots once sprayed i tried this on separate occasions after using my usual shampoo amp conditioner and styling the usual way it failed hugely times i used sprays trying different techniques to see if maybe i was using too much or too little product all had the same results i have thin medium thickness hair cut into a pixie that i wear messy this made my hair look completely flatlike a hair helmet no matter what i did it turned out the same epic fail tony amp guys volume plumping whip is infinitely better

2311,3.0,i purchased this top in white and lavender the white is very nice soft and semisheer but not completely seethru fine with a nude bra it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front but i expected that i purchased a medium and its plenty roomy i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional b
2312,5.0,every now and then a piece like this one comes along at retailer and i quickly make the purchase without any regret without being stuffy or old this top is simply elegant the floral is very highend designer think italian made for a fraction of the cost made of bamboo it is light without being sheer there is no need for a cami with this one the fabric has the body of a good linen but it doesnt wrinkle nearly as much it does require dry cleaning though if this matters to you

2326,1.0,average tv quality pathetic installation policy of the company thoroughly disappointed with unprofessional companys installation policy regret to purchase this tv
2327,1.0,battery life is bit low as compared to other budget mobiles
2328,2.0,amazone service is best but doubtful quality of product because colour of my device starded fading within and half month of use which is not covered under warrenty

2337,4.0,after one month of heavy usage pros super amoled display this is the reason i bought it mah battery it really lasts long camera quality is really good rear camera works really well and selife cam is just awesome just turn off the beauty mode fingerprint sensor is decent not that fast but i guess ota update can make it fast earphone output is really good plus the dolby atmos feature just makes the experience great edm lover soo you can trust this always on display is a cool feature to use blue light filter works well cons processor is used is not from snapdragon but thats not an issue for me as exynos works well while heavy gaming also please say at this price point you can get many features in readmi and realme phones but they have annoying ads to and realme color os just sucks and no amoled display for me samsung works best in class if youre planning to buy just go for it no ads
2338,2.0,average phone from xiomi average camera results less fingerprint sensitivity and low display resolution disappointed from mi a also software issue in new phone
2340,2.0,but it just doesnt measure up first the sliplining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on either stepping into it or pulling it over your head and once on the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky unfortunately i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately the material is really cute but the dress isnt worth the price effort
2341,1.0,camera quality is too bad sometimes it slows down amazon is not accepting the return request very bad customer service
2342,2.0,this product reminded me of why i turned to muawithout its product review guidance i make bad choices my hair needs a trim and with winter too it is a bit dry and lacklustre i was unimpressed at how my pot wasnt totally full even though i chose one from the back of the shelf but i shrugged it off it went on feeling rich and heavy and i left it on for the recommended amount of time but when i rinsed it out my hair felt like i had just used a normal conditioner not some quotrenewingquot treatment when i was blow drying my hair it felt like it had a weird texture and i am sure it looked duller i would have been unhappy if this had cost me let alone aud which it cost my hair is not dyed or chemically processed nor do i heat style on a regular basisso there is no reason why this did not work except that its a terrible product the points are for scent and a slight increase in volume i will use it as a regular conditioner so it isnt a complete waste of money but i will never again buy it
2343,2.0,this dress was not what i had hoped from the online pictures i had high hopes but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress needless to say its going back

2383,2.0,very disappointed when i received this the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that first it is nearly a crop top second it is boxy and its attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky third need to size down sizes had to return this
2384,3.0,hanging
2385,2.0,i like the scent but thats about it this conditioner failed to protect my hair from the corresponding organix shea butter shampoo which dried my hair out completely ill probably pair this up with a better shampoo to finish it up then wash my hands of organix forever

2396,4.0,i purchased this sweater in camel and love it the fabric is very soft and lightweight perfect for warmer climates with chilly but not cold weather im and got a medium but the sleeves seemed a bit long to me its also a bit boxy due to double breasted the cut so if you have a petite frame it may overwhelm you otherwise its definitely a great coat for the money
2397,3.0,battery life is really well fingerprint is unlock at some time in many numbers of attempts face recognition is good but the main problem in the phone is become overheating at the outside in very less time and all the apps closed at the time
2398,5.0,using it for a few weeks now i closed my dish tv connection after purchasing this excellent quality works great with g wifi as always ontime delivery from amazon

2409,3.0,i tried this on at the store and though it was pretty i was a little underwhelmed it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea but the quality was not great they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking the idea of the top was better than the execution
2410,4.0,good product dont compare to any local product as they produce sound and sony produces clarity
2411,1.0,mobile speaker voice is very slow why
2412,2.0,the top of this suit was not proportioned well i am normally a c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium the cup size on this was very small for a medium the band to hook in the back was almost too big there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back
2413,3.0,i ended up returning it just because it didnt do much for my current postnatal figure but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique
2414,4.0,but not for me i usually try to buy petite sizes since i am only ft in but this was just too pretty to pass up so i took a chance and ordered a regular size xs right out of the bag i was impressed with the colors and fabric of this romper however i did not notice that the entire back was open until i put it on from the pictures it looks like there is a small opening but when i put it on i was exposed all the way down to my lower back this may not be the same for a taller person s
2415,3.0,based on previous reviews i sized up to size i typically wear xs or s while the length was okay the body was way too wide the neck was almost like a mock neck higher than i expected which made it very uncomfortable for me overall i didnt find it flattering or anything special
2416,5.0,i sadly only noticed this top once on sale i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big i would need the petite so i had to leave it behind lbs dd but it is adorable can be dressed up and classy casually with jeans or sweetly so many ways love the subtle polka dots oh well i am sure i will find something similar i love
2417,5.0,i am pearshaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right these did the trick they are slim in the waist but have plenty of room for bigger hips the overall fit is body skimminghugging but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way and i have no gapping at the waist the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch but they will be a perfect pant for the office for reference i am and i got a regular
2418,5.0,i love that productits too good im so happy for choose this tv sound quality are good thanks a lot

2431,4.0,i love this dress tried it on at the store they only had medium while im usually always a medium it fit perfectly but pulled at the bust im a i ordered a large online the next day i have it now and i am extremely pleased the pattern is unique the length falls just above the knee and has s sexy flirtiness to it the back button is key as it gives some contour to the dress the side pockets are an awesome touch you can wear this dress any season im wearing it with ankle boots and
2432,1.0,i have worst experience with this mobile it has no ringtone hanging problem scratches on it it is good for nothing compared with price
2433,3.0,i use this conditioner after using the tea tree mint shampoo and it makes my hair shiny soft and silky on days that i blowdry and straighten i feel like using heat products activates something in the conditioner that helps hair look and feel especially shiny and soft my boyfriend uses the conditioner as well and says he has noticed the same thing when he blowdries his hair however on days where i dont use heatstyling products it makes my hair a bit more dryi have fine straightwavyish black hair also the conditioner runs out fairly quickly unlike the shampoo i usually have to squeeze out a considerable amount of product for use each time i bought the tea tree in the hopes that it would also help get rid of dandruff but i havent noticed a significant change either way it is a decent product i like the organix line the smell is amazing and not too overbearing the mint scent also helps to wake me up in the morning overall i would recommend this product especially if you blowdry andor straighten on a regular basis
2434,1.0,usb cable got burnt and not workingi think its a duplicate product because my friend bought same product from mi store design is different from the product which i bought from amazon
2435,3.0,i ordered the red color way and the bird print is very cute that said it is cut aline and not like a regular button down through i found it tts and good quality it was shorter than i would have liked this exaggerated the aline shape i didnt completely dislike it but i didnt love it either
2436,3.0,built quality camera display and battery is good it does not have in built clipboard and some times touch is little slow in reponse before this i was using redmi pro very little difference in performance comparing their hardware difference and top of all current hand set is samsung flagship model
2437,2.0,i was looking to this conditioner to maybe replace my pureology hydrate set since those are so expensive but this conditioner really didnt do much for my hair at all i was disappointed because while it did sort of condition my hair it left my hair very thick and very easily tangled my hair is slightly thick already and tangles easily already and i feel like this just exacerbated all the bad qualities i think this would work really well as a thickening sort of conditioner for thinner hair types it wasnt a hit for me
2438,1.0,while the dot works well when it is working it has the very annoying habit of not connecting to my wifi although nothing changed not the position of the wifi nor the dotmy phone a tablet and a laptop have absolutely no issue connecting to the network in the same spotthe dots cant connect often when first connected then stopped and asked to play music min laterthis goes for both my dots it always requires setup of the wifi again through the less than functional alexa app
2439,1.0,bloody shipping defective iphones which wont even start
2440,4.0,i love the look of this blouse and i like the light weight material it would require a camisole underneath but could be worn at the office or a night out i purchased a size and it fit perfect once i was able to get it on so i wouldnt want a larger size but because it doesnt button down all the way and its so fitted in the waist it was nearly impossible to get it on and off over my shoulders theres no give at all sadly im going to have to return it
2441,1.0,this vest looked so cute online but its a disaster the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesnt work properly and it just hangs itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie seriously its bad
2442,3.0,nice delivery by amazon it comes at home very easily honestly color of real refrigerator and on amazon slitely different which i do not like overall all things is perfect
2443,4.0,everything is fine but microphone doesnt work properly even mobile was fixed at the mi service center
2444,4.0,i bought this top when i was months pregnant and wore it the rest of the pregnancy i am d and lbs i got all the way up to lbs and a chest size of dd now that im not pregnanti dont think it flatters my new figure anymore ha but i seriously wore it all the time when i was pregnantso gotta give it at least stars
2445,2.0,this dress was really odd i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but thats about it the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large i was just very underwhelmed with this dress also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution overall its okay just hated it on me
2446,4.0,i love it
2447,4.0,i ordered the neutral one with the fine stripe it will layer nicely with neutral colored sweaters and blazers the fabric is soft the quality is good the neck is cool that you can wear it two ways overall it is a good top i think its a little clingy which highlights every flaw in the back especially i wouldnt size up i still think it fits tts
2448,5.0,one of the best phone

2450,1.0,i purchased sed canon d with dual lens but there is no battery given in the delivered goods
2451,2.0,this dress is beautiful and extremely well made if you can get into it the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back its form fitting so youd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper but its soooo form fitting im afraid i wouldnt wear it
2452,3.0,i so wanted to love this dress the color and fabrics are beautiful and scream summer i was so disappointed by the fit through the different fabrics are such a cool concept but it wasnt executed that well one material is pleated like an accordion so wants to constrict the next material is crocheted so is a little more stiff and the third material is pretty average on the bottom where its flowy it doesnt make that much of a difference but on top and in the middle it gives this weird i
2453,4.0,i ordered this app in feb phone is very good in built quality no hang no heating no charges on free app mostly usable great camera quality good screen resolution strong aluminium body good and strong sim tray great sound quality in apple headphones loved good quality charging cum usb cable and charger the only shortcoming is only battery backup so keep battery bank with you average battery life is one day for calling if you off the data in data mode only rest for hours over all value for money and do purchase and use it
2454,1.0,worst seller dont buy battery issue
2455,4.0,i bought this dress in the cream color it was sold out online in most sizes but i stumbled upon it in person and immediately had to have it im usually xs or small and bought the small they did not have an xs available so i cant compare but the small was flattering and comfortable im c and it falls perfectly at my ankles no dragging and looks great with simple neutral sandals as some reviewers have mentioned it has some weight to it so its probably not great for hot da

2464,5.0,great sweater cozy and thick the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater i got a small and it fit perfectly

2470,4.0,very good mobile
2471,5.0,i tried this on in the store and i found my regular medium to be a bit too boxy i ended up going with the petite large because i found it just fit better it wasnt too wide and fit just right it is very soft not itchy at all it says dry clean only but it did great on my hand wash setting with cold water laid it out to dry great purchase
2472,2.0,a fun toy when it works but not reliable for the visually impaired all too frequently it refuses to respond it lights up like it hears the request then shuts down without responding a half hour later it may respond to the same command previously ignored sometimes it recites the calendar schedule other times it says there is no calendar text messages only go to devices with an alexa app and even then there is no notification on the receiving end none that i find in settings i got this for my sight impaired wife to expand her social interactions manage our security system calendar home automation and have the ability to call me if there is a problem a fun toy but not good as a home aid
2473,1.0,bought it for my lg l android phone and in the phone it stayed speed is average the problem is that it broke within months with all my data in there

2478,3.0,its fine k its disappoiting why company omit backlid led keyboard licensed ms office outlook not bundled pen funtionality is not so great also mouse pad has a creaking noise i made attempt for replacement but no one processed my request
2479,1.0,wasnt what i expected too much work i involved on users part speaker sucks the only thing i really use it for is an alarm clock should have got a google home
2480,1.0,this mobile is dad
2481,2.0,phone is nice however phone makers should not provide such low class accessories very much disappointing both from xiaomi and amazon later on on contacting amazon people and sharing the images of the faulty cable they did not provide any replacement of the same
2482,1.0,worst product it has gb ram bt i cant able to do multiple task at same time it always get hangduring call screen get automatically lock if u wanna try to cut the phone it is not possible bcoz screen didnt opn
2483,5.0,not up to expectations of pictures quality
2484,1.0,after days of my usage i wrote review on this power bank its a worst item when i charge this power bank the changing slot is slowly melting for fist two days its working is well after that slowly battery power is going to down and finally it is not able to charge my power bank is give life just days
2485,5.0,this provides plenty of storage capacity for your tablet and mobile devices ive put this into all my cellphones and android tablets after twelve months of use downloading music videos apps there is plenty of room leftthe class version is also great for phonetablet cameras as well for a stand alone camera yes i still use a digital camera so yesterday this is a must for hd action video camerarecorder as well the price continues to drop so it is very affordable now unless your device can take the gb version id go with the higher capacity for video recording devices
2486,2.0,in my pov the phone lengtg is perfect for a normal use but the device intetnal is little bit pathetic
2487,3.0,cons finger print sensor is slow as compare to redmi note pro my last phone pixels of camera distorted while zooming even after it have mp camera pros superb battery life best display quality nice built quality
2488,5.0,with lot of research i bought this tv a tv with led screen for ease to eyes inches for full hd was what i wanted for my living room i wanted android support as well this search led me to kevin with good price surprisingly i had no second thought and selected it right away the installation was on time perfect for my room it gave me the features which i expected voice picture clarity im a christian and wanted worship experience and listening to the word of god and i did get that experience quite good this is my first led tv and im proud of the purchase
2489,1.0,product was very poor at actually conditioning the hair it was way too light of a product and felt cheap i was using almost half a cup it seemed just to get enough to make my hair feel conditioned i would never repurchase this product again it reminded me of a cent conditioner youd use as a kid
2490,4.0,got the card took it out of the package dropped it in my samsung s rebooted and it detected it immediately no need to format or anything havent done any speed tests but i havent noticed any sluggishness that would warrant them either
2491,3.0,the sweater fits a bit awkward in the front it draped more than i would have liked also the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching returned the item
2492,4.0,looks are amazing however the camera is not that great additional features like quick ball screenshot with slide are pretty cool
2493,2.0,pathetic battery life not expected this from a mi phone stock android sucks not recommended for casual users
2494,5.0,totally superior quality i had mi note pro earlier and now when i ran a small test where i played same youtube video on full brightness full volume on both phones this phone totally beats note pro video quality sound quality is amazing plus the battery feels safe to carry it on long drives ine important thing to note is the black in videos ms has true black whereas in note pro i could easily see poor picture quality as black wasnt true black it was opaquely black with a white tinge plus it has a memory card slot great also dolby atmos surround for headphones now move on to cons i have heard the screen quality isnt great which is disappointing as ill now be extra cautious not to drop it second the phone doesnt come with a back cover third it should have a notification led that will make things easier
2495,5.0,outta would be less to give so battery life will never disppoint you during ur long travel shedules camera will turn you in a photographer with sinple clicks image stabilization is superb and image quality is equivalent to a dslr photoshoot wide range of options between shooting modes and a floating shutter button provides ease while handling phone during selfiesgroupfies without an earphone but m sure you would use bluetooth handfree to remain tanglefree the price range and the quality is unmatched deliverable which samsung has made into reality without making a hole in your pocket you are upgrading to the best in class tech specs add samsung mm smartwatch or samsung active watch to add to your style
2496,3.0,i would have given this a star because we really like the whole echo line and we have many of them however and this just started happening amazon has made a change to where we can no longer listen to different music on the devices individually in other words if i want to listen to classic rock in the kitchen and my husband listen to country in the garage that cant happen anymore this totally cancels out why ive purchased so many of them i really hate this i might be putting all of our echos on ebay shortly
2497,5.0,its lightlooks cooland most important it spreads sound like so u can hear it from a distance also strong enoughdropped it a few times but no problems
2498,2.0,support level to wireless keyboard is not good no free app for indian tv channels jio tv not supported strongly recommend to purchase an android tv box intead of this not much suitable for india and specially kerala as less malayalam films are offered for streaming
2499,2.0,really you can just used for news and weather information cant communicate with your phone or make call to anybody who dont have a echo calendar and all other skills need to be thru echos app only
2500,4.0,looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants i have wider hips usually an or on bottom and narrower shoulders small or medium on top i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized i am a b and did not have any issues with button gap my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch
2501,2.0,i did not find quite usedul
2502,5.0,phone is good but not very user friendly as rani may be i was used to redmi but overall its solidly built not a great battery back up as i imagined camera quality is also average for a mp i love the product as it is available for affordable price with gb ram but as i am not avid gamer this is ok looks ok functions well will update after moderate usage
2503,1.0,no mobile found inside tha packet or box hence i was asked to put pancard copy for refund or return
2504,1.0,okay so i was in the dominican republic for the month of august and my hair got so dry and brittle from wetting it everyday at the beachpoolriver etc i decided to purchase this entire line organix morrocan to help repair my hair i am soooooooo disappointed these products made my hair sooooooo much more dry and damaged i wanted to cry the first time i used it i couldnt believe how much this thing effed up my hair my hair is curly and long i only needed something to give it moisture and this product made my hair worse than when i started i dont recommend this product for latina curly hair the price is not bad and the packaging isnt either but the product itself sucks
2505,4.0,tried on bought instore so cute flattering the picture doesnt do it justice great neutral piece more beige than ivory in person looks cute tied or untied im and lbs and the regular size s fit perfectly not too snug not too loose and just long enough to cover my bum
2506,3.0,phone is good for its price but right from the day one speaker is not workingamazon has not send any soft copy of bill on my mail due to which i m not able to get it repaired at service center
2507,1.0,received unauthorized product got it checked by apple care center and phone is dead it has been only months
2508,5.0,another excellent maxi dress by ranna gill usually this brand of dresses tends to run small in the bodice requiring me to go up a size but i found that this dress ran true to size i got a petite as well cause the standard size was a touch too long for me very happy with the color quality and uniqueness of the dress
2509,4.0,good product worth buying and good value for money
2510,1.0,i bought this book recently while i was absorbed in reading suddenly i found a break of the flow as page number to was missing it definitely maligned the dignity of the book totally disappointed
2511,4.0,good refrigerator worth fr money
2512,2.0,i got my phone today undoubtedly the camera beats all other competitors stunning clarity and it provides awesome performance while playing high graphics games but im highly disappointed when i came to know that it doesnt have an external memory slot only a lite has an expandable memory slot the buyer has to satisfy with internal memory gb in my case or has to go with cloud storage option surprisingly this information doesnt available on their product page here now its too late for me and im thinking about my decision to go for this phone
2513,4.0,very good and fast delivery
2514,4.0,really good deal definitely a good way to save money buying an item with less memory and buying one of these is a lot cheaper
2515,4.0,nice phone
2516,4.0,i like the pointelle feature in the front i end up wearing a lot of black but this at least gives me the option to do a bit of color underneath if i so chose ive worn this with white black and blue jeans w boots looks great im and lbs i got a medium but i could have possibly gone with a small my only complaint is that it might be a tad bit too long since im on the shorter size i cant imagine it would be too much of an issue for others
2517,3.0,it doesnt come with pre shipped ms office highly regretted
2518,3.0,i am on the fence about this one the length is great it hits right above my knee at overall it was larger than i was hoping the waist is pretty loose and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide i wish they had it in a petite size for this price i will probably return it its not worth the price tag
2519,1.0,nokia plus is third class mobile camera is worst that i have seen mobile is not working properly play store is not working we cant download any aap from play store as it is not working properly and nokia plus does not have return policy so please be aware before ordering this phone
2520,1.0,very bed battery bakup do not bye everyone
2521,3.0,beautiful dress but it just didnt look that flattering on me the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off i definitely dont
2522,1.0,it is not worth for total waste no whatsapp notifications
2523,2.0,fingure print reader is too slow camera quality is ok battery life is goodprocessor is slow screen brightness is poor
2524,1.0,system processing speed is very slow
2525,2.0,its always hangs
2526,5.0,i ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening after seeing the other reviews i wasnt sure about it but i was very pleased when it arrived i find it is elegant and sexy but also modest enough when i sized up by i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly it is formfitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight im excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace
2527,1.0,would have used hardly for to hours since i got this product and it does not charge now return window already crossed and a total loss for me amazon stop selling such substandard products plz
2528,2.0,no it did not
2529,4.0,love this sweater i have it in the raspberry and the charcoal color its so soft and comfortable looks great with jeans or leggings its casual but you can dress it up a bit and you still looked polished its a little oversized only downfall is that it piles easily
2530,3.0,loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer
2531,5.0,does what it is supposed to do performance is good and never seems to slow down the phone great product so far
2532,4.0,best phone in this range
2533,1.0,the mobile body its not fully fitted properly which i have received mobile has fast charging but its taking longer duration to full charging camera clarity not good instead of samsung ms could of been chosen realme mobiles
2534,4.0,overall i really like this oil so far ive had the product for about three weeks now and i can definitively say that it has helped stop my hair loss in conjunction to using the oil i have started using the biotin collagen shampoo by organix also and have been taking biotin and vitamin e capsules i use this oil the night before i wash my hair by massaging my scalp then applying the rest through my ends it definitely makes a beneficial difference and you cant go wrong for the price i dont like the packaging though i wish it came with a pump for convenience
2535,2.0,its making a lot of noise like a drilling machineits not value for money
2536,2.0,i loved this thing but it only lasted just months then completely died wtf amazon
2537,5.0,yea
2538,3.0,tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom top is perfect will return the bottoms and try the large
2539,4.0,nice quality material the green is pretty color just a good cozy top i normally wear a large in retailer clothes and the large in this world was very roomy which was fine with me if you are short and have smaller shoulders and bust definitely go for a size smaller than you would normally wear
2540,4.0,timely deliverygood productsaffordable price in this configuration
2541,1.0,it was getting warm in mins of usage there was an issue with the microphone too i could hear some disturbance while on call it was never clear audio camera quality was poor but amazon accepted my return without enquiring much detail star for amazon star for the product
2542,1.0,i like camera but i dont like battery life and fingerprint because fingerprint sensor is very slow
2543,4.0,this runs way big i would recommend sizing down at least one size possibly i got the design with divers its fun and light for summer soft material and very comfy
2544,4.0,and another addition to my wedding guest wardrobe the skirt print is gorgeous and i cant wait to shop for the perfect shoe and accessories im very hippy with a thinner waist and this hides that i love the pockets and the fact that i can wear a regular comfortable bra allaround a great purchase
2545,4.0,nice mobile at this price everything is good except the front camera should be more than mega pixel but this mp gives good photos u must try this phone
2546,1.0,worst productworked only for months
2547,3.0,picture quality ok and features ok
2548,3.0,lot of things to tell positives it gives us a premium look negatives battery life it drains very fastly fingerprint sensor bit slow in recognising shutter doesnt respond quickly certain apps from play store doesnt install
2549,1.0,got a phone which was already used for hrs im not able to even access the app store its stuck got it on the sale day for the exchange of my old phone regret the decision worst experience
2550,1.0,its charging point is not good it stop working after days
2551,4.0,i liked the simple styling of these jeans when i saw them in the store the price is right considering what some jeans cost today unfortunately these are made in china that bummed me out they run a tad bit small but in the end i think they are more true to size because they give especially in the waist the higher waist is a nice change its nice to be able to skip a belt the denim is a bit rough after air drying so i hope it softens up
2552,4.0,i really liked the beautiful fabric design and length of the piece
2553,2.0,so far i dont know how to get it to work more for meall it does is give me news headlines and not much else and to have music i have to be pay premium on the stations
2554,5.0,hi amazon had taken this charger in the old order mobile its charger was not working i had talked about it so they said that you should take the charge what will i do for that
2555,3.0,low light camera performance is very poor compare to moto g otherwise display and build is real feel good factor i gift it to my mother
2556,4.0,im enjoying her but she has many limits
2557,2.0,not a coat by any means merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isnt pretty enough for a spring coatsizing is also sizes larger than anticipated
2558,3.0,these were very nice but had to return i have a hard time with jeans as i am big and curvy in hips and butt these were tight in those places and big in the waist
2559,2.0,i like this watch
2560,2.0,i was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately its going back because the knit is just too thin i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but its not and because its so light the swing effect doesnt really come off nothing special
2561,4.0,they are good but not that great at this price
2562,4.0,good quality sound but low bass
2563,1.0,off the bat ill say that this conditioner might be suitable for you even if it disagreed with me i took a terrible allergic reaction to both the shampoo and conditioner causing immediate irritation with my lips and face swelling and my scalp neck and face soon breaking out in eczema it is a real shame because the product smells lovely and did actually leave my hair wonderfully shiny and soft stay away if you have sensitive skin
2564,5.0,initially i was a bit hesitant in buying online but the product turned out awesome
2565,2.0,like picture quality battery life deslike sound quality is very poor operating system is modified by mi which is not good so many unnecessary mi apps android is modified by mi
2566,3.0,slow mo videos are too grainy i replaced the product with new one still the same but i tested with my friend honor x it works fineis it is a faulty product
2567,5.0,undoubtedly its a great piece of innovation iphone x is not only a premium mobile but a great product thanks to amazon for making an on time delivery and great packing
2568,4.0,a good motivational book mainly for professionalssystematic action plan to get ridoff worries and negative thinking in day today life
2569,2.0,im taller so its not uncommon for things to be too short on me but this was really short for the style it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size both up top and in the wavy part below the style really just did not work with the length it looked very odd
2570,5.0,classy tunic can be worn with jeans or leggings neckline is small but stretches so it goes on easily color is perfect for spring my only word of cautionthe design can add a bit of bulk around the middle so probably not your best bet if you are tummy conscious
2571,3.0,it is too early to write a review about this phone the camera quality is good the battery life is also great but charging is slow if we compare it with other type c charging mobiles then it will take almost hrs for complete charge whereas other type c charging phone like poco f one plus series etc charge in only hrs now a days every phone manufacturers give a back cover or screen gaurd with their handsets but its its missing in samsung
2572,3.0,the phone is very gud in this prize but the camera quality they are give is too bad not atall like megapixl so plzzzz dont buy you will get q very gud camera quality in this prize in other phonesorry to say but this was bad buy for me
2573,3.0,sound is okay not too good bass is shallow trebble is really high misses the balance between treble n bass the wire though feels of cheap quality is stiff for this price range go for philips they have headphones which are quite well balanced have a better build quality
2574,5.0,it is got smart tv in this price range all the features are good recommend to purchase without any doubt
2575,1.0,average
2576,2.0,poor quality for charging my one plus one charge so slowly didnt expect low quality product from boat
2577,5.0,i am an retailer employee i immediately fell in love with this dress i tried it on and it was way to long as always with regular store sizesi am short i wanted to order but it was backordered for about a month i ordered it anyway my husband and i took a mini vacation to chicago over easter weekend and in the miracle mile store they had the dress in my petite size i was in heaven as they had an awesome petite area in the store there i purchased a petite which is the size i
2578,5.0,thank you amazon the book is good for preparing ssc and chsl covered all topics
2579,2.0,this product is not working properly some times only one earphone will work
2580,4.0,after using for a month i would say that overall it is close to good camera is fine so the speed separate connector has to be used as normal portjack for earphone is not present in handset rather an extension to be used to connect the earphone coming to screendisplay it is good in clarity but the navigation buttons eats up the bottom space while displaying the content of imagevideos i wish there could be customizable setting available to hide and unhide the navigation button at bottom battery is average works for a day with high usage
2581,5.0,camera is awesome however battery life is not good
2582,1.0,this just to highlight the type of service i got from icare in bangalore paid twice inr k just to get the macbook air diagnosed which is just year months old and then i got a wow factor diagnosis details checked and found device is not powering on did smc pram and checked with known good power adapter still same issue cleaned and reseated all the connectors and checked no go checked the device with bare minimal configuration and power on pads same issue suspecting issue in logic board hence need to replace the logic board under exchange price to check further amount to be paid rs not getting any answer why is this apple what a customer support infact the service guy informed that these issues are frequent with macbook air this is the worst service support have ever got from any brand
2583,5.0,comfy cozy and great bargain for the sale price
2584,3.0,hope they can improve on the confusing setup steps
2585,4.0,this is an amazing phone at the price of this phone is too damn worthy its got looks like an s series model good camera amazing batterycool colour gradient and so on im sure that you wont get a better one at this price
2586,1.0,i love the smell of this but it made my hair really coarse and dry i thought it would to the exact opposite because it being sulfate free and all i actually had to mix it with a dove conditioner just to use it
2587,4.0,i had recieved the product days ago already crossed hours and didnot get any installation even after requesting it i got a reschedule of installation message two times right now i m using the tv by installing it on the leg stand provided no voice recognition it is the worst thing other things are fine but wud be better if qwerty key pad was given on the remote itself picture quality is good
2588,2.0,received product with hardware problem tv menu and source bottom no workingrequested for replacement but still there is no confirmation from their end there is no option for voice control
2589,5.0,i always buy sandisk because of their reputation they make a great product and have never had any problems with these sd cards
2590,5.0,its flagship killer in terms of cameraperformancewrap chargetoo gd to believe just wireless charging is missing else its a kickass phone within price range under k
2591,4.0,takes around hours to fully chargecharging adapter is not included in packageyou have to use your own charging adaptera one feet cable comes with this package to charge your mobilecharged my samsung j with this powerbank times from to times powerbank charge went down to indicators out of so quality is doubtable
2592,5.0,no words osm mobile
2593,4.0,its ok but not sure how to really use it on a daily basis
2594,4.0,great phone with large screen but camera is not so good picture quality is average processor is very responsive and faceunlock is sometime late and all thing is good ui should be simple its kind of typical thats it
2595,4.0,battery backup is the issue but otherwise its a good product i would recommend adding more watch faces
2596,5.0,i picked this up this weekend so gorgeous i usually dont do maxi length at it can be overwhelming but this is so flattering this is floor length on me i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame ill pair it with a cream blouse pictured to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look im usually a and the small fits perfectly
2597,5.0,awesome bass and clear sound good product
2598,3.0,i liked the concept of this vest but when i tried it on i felt like i was years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform it was also very boxy and wide it seemed to be wellmade though and maybe would have worked if it were a different color
2599,2.0,ive had a lot of misses from retailer lately ive loved this dress since i first saw it in the springsummer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale when it arrived i literally lol its an ill fitting nightgown the size small was a tent on me and its so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldnt be worn in public theres a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesnt do much pass ladies
2600,1.0,it is not working
2602,4.0,cute and comfortable top very cute top that i will have to wait a few months to wear until it is cooler out but a great piece to pick up for a nice price it is soft and comfortable with a generous amount of room but not where you look too big i ordered it in the blue but really it is like a dark gray which does not bother me
2603,1.0,nothing pre installed you have to bear another for installation of apps and softwares
2604,3.0,i am a proportionate year old and thought this dress would look great its aline and looks a lot like the kind of dresses that usually fit me nicely i bought it in an p which is my normal size the hips were a little too big but not bad the top part however was enormous the cut in the shouldersneckline was way too wide the lace sleeves were way too big there was too much room in the bust my c cup was inadequate etc this dress would look nice on someone who is thickervol

2607,4.0,
2608,2.0,smells so nice but thats pretty much it ive been using it for long enough to give it a fair review and only havent replaced it because im lazy its done nothing to the condition of my and unless you wait for a while for it to dry before using straighteners it makes the hair sizzle when going over with a flat iron wouldnt recommend and was a waste of money
2609,4.0,would be great if she could speak spanish and other languages and could answer better about things that is possible to ask her usually she ask you to see the app instead of explaining you what you have to do in order to activate something in general she is very useful

2611,5.0,amazing smell so addicted to this lightweight clean yet moisturising shampoo ive got naturally oily but easily tangled hair due to having my hair permed so the dilemma was finding a shampoo that would not leave my hair oily but not dry out my hair so this shampoo did the trick the only issue is that its quite expensive for a little bottle
2612,2.0,very disappointing product from xioami my old redmi note pro gives better performance than this even google photos are not working properly taking too much time to respond speed of the product is really pathetic camera is not showing the quality of mega pixcels mentioned in the specification giving star just because of the amoled display which is really awesomein all other matter mobile didnt reach the expectation less settings cant customise the guestors really feels like why i went for this product

2620,3.0,i fell in love with this dress when the catalog came in the mail and jumped online immediately to order it the dress just arrived and is not as pictured in the catalog the picture of the model walking on the beach in that picture it appears to have black lining or a black slip underneath when in reality there is nude lining sewn into every edge and isnt going anywhere for a minute i thought about having it removed by a tailor but it seems the entire dress would have to be resewn some of
2621,1.0,although i wasnt expecting much this device is even more useless than anticipated it has only been good as a kitchen timer and for saying the weather to make it worse its ambient temperature is high enough that it stains wood as such there is nowhere in my apartment that this can go so its going into the closet never to be used again

2631,3.0,i bought this on a whim because it was a buy one get one free deal at my local rite aid i needed to buy new shampoo and conditioner to replace my aubrey organics i wasnt looking for an organic shampoo but something cheap and from a drugstore because i am having an out of money experience i smelled all the shampoos on the shelve it was between the passionfruit grava and this one and i chose this one because it smelled really good the smell definately dissapears after you wash even if you use it with the same conditioner overall it is an ok shampoo nothing special foams pretty good but it is definately average i have to say it reminds me of those v shampoos that i think are no longer that and suave definately reminds of something like that

2634,3.0,excellent product fast delivery days before date definitely recommended to buy
2635,1.0,cant ask alexa to send a text or make a call unless the other person has the alexa app so i would have to convince over people to get the appcant leave a voice recording for someone else in the house like in the commercial no information found on how to do that the google assistant is far more functional and it was stock on my phoneto play the music you have to have a spotify account and then deal with spam from that unless you pay for the subscriptionhalf of the things ive asked alexa she says hmmm im not sure
2636,5.0,i purchased this top at my local store this past weekend and i have to say i already know it will become an easy goto top it does run large so consider that when choosing what size to order i generally wear a medium but purchased a small in this top
2637,2.0,looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment both the colors and style the material seems great quality but its stiff and scratchy the style is very boxy and as another reviewer said just hung im a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me back it goes

2643,2.0,i have relaxed hair and was searching for sulfate and paraben free products to baby my super dry hair this product is just not rich enough i thought i had wasted my money until i started using coconut oil as a prewash conditioning treatment after washing with the tea tree shampoo and using this as a creme rinse seriously that is all this really is my hair is soft fresh and manageable very shiny and much healthier if you have seriously dry hair try this combination otherwise i would look for another natural product for moisturizing
2644,2.0,worse
2645,1.0,childsize not sure where this went wrong but its going back immediately always wear a in retailerpologist skirts this size runs at least two sizes too small the material is beautiful but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric so disappointing

2653,4.0,i had this in my wish list a long time ten when sale came along my size was sold out however someone returned it at my local store i purchased it then tried it on later why i ended returning it fabric was gorgeous and light but fall is coming and i wont wear it until next summer may get over it by then the shape is really nice but the hem hit me in a weird spot on my short muscular legs as others mentioned there are spots where the sewing is not perfect and bulges a little

2655,2.0,not very happy with the product apps stops abruptly and then asks for factory reset
2656,3.0,i loved this when i got it it has such a flattering fit slightly loose in the body but not flowy nice weight of fabric comfortable fabric perfect scoop neck that doesnt show too much cleavage but i washed it once on delicate and line dried which i do with most of my shirts and it came out riddled in holes
2657,5.0,a complete smart phone has low weight and good speed everything superb cute and quality design and well finished product built quality is good tgsn iphones and all other chinees phones this one is made in india
2658,3.0,pros smells absolutely fabulous lathers really well and leaves hair squeaky clean cons pricey for drugstore shampoo and doesnt moisturize at all kind of a bummer purchase honestly
2659,1.0,phone heating and battery backup issue i am use this phone normal in a day but battery goes down in a half day when we use phone continually one hour phone generated to much heat
2660,1.0,absolute nitemare would not recommend even for a software engineer total frustration customer service polite and courteous but they do not know what to do most do not speak english well enough to understand issues and they certainly can not reply to questionsreturned everything including the smart plugs and other gadgets purchased no one could get them to work and that includes the manufactures
2661,1.0,unwanted advertisement will appear on lock screen getting frustrated changed all settings but still they are coming
2662,1.0,we received the echo dot for christmas in december its now september months and it no longer responds to voice commanders or button presses tried all fixes suggested on amazons help pages no change called customer support and spent half an hour on the phone only to be told in that end its broken you should buy a another one they offered a partial discount but that would still leave us paying to replace what they admit was a faulty productwe enjoyed it while we had it i suspect most of them dont fail within the first months but im giving it star because if it does fail amazons solution is to have you pay them more money to get another one
2663,5.0,got this in the bluefloral and absolutely love it

2667,5.0,i like kevin tv super quality and looking good really good tv superb tv
2668,2.0,my daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between and this dress was sloppy on every one of us i dont think a size x small would have made a difference the length is all over the place im not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture on the positive side was very soft it may work as a beach cover up
2669,3.0,i wanted to love this dress i ordered an xsmall and a small i am and lbs slender build the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress both sizes will have to be returned possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist
2670,2.0,not going to lie i am disappointed mainly disappointed because you have to leave it plugged in for it to work i also thought it was going to be able to search stuff on the web like an assistant this device is very limited to what it can and cant do
2671,3.0,bad experience though the design looks good phone quality is poor the display itself is not sticked properly to the phone and is coming out wondering what kind of quality check samsung is doing as this is already days found it after this cant return this phone
2672,3.0,this was amazing when my hair was healthy and dyed dark brown it gave my hair lovely volume and kept it soft then when i went blonde through about heavy highlighting sessions i repurchased it thinking it would help my dried out bleached hair nope it just made it super tangled so now my hair needs something more repairing and i wont be repurchasing this but if you have non damaged hair that needs a bit of volume this is probably for you
2673,5.0,bought this for my daughter in laws birthday its just a beautiful feminine design well made nice fabric she can wear this for work or for lunch or an evening out very versatile
2674,2.0,ringtone not hearing due to speaker given back side
2675,5.0,i had this in my cart for ages waiting for a sale and debating the dress in general i am delighted as it did finally go on sale i bought it and it is fabulous my measurements are i wear a d bra and the small fit perfectly the only problem i have had with it is that the lining in the front shows about at the bottom of the dress once i have worn the dress what seems to happen is that the dress creeps up due to its wrinkling but the lining does not hence the showing i
2676,3.0,as a petite big busted woman i found this dress wildly unflattering the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent the design of the bust however i found unflattering
2677,3.0,my product got damaged on its own after months use
2678,5.0,the pictures online do not do this justice i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe it can actually be worn ways i like closing the closest snaptheres two in the middle with a skinny belt over it and a slip dress underneath this way the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking think s glam it can also be fully closed like in the picture or left ope
2679,4.0,awesomely different top the first time i wore it i didnt wash it so it was big on me it shrunk from washing so it fits better now there is some unraveling of the frayed edges though
2680,2.0,very poor sound quality
2681,2.0,product is really good quality wisebut really poor durability stopped working in less than a year can claim for warranty because i lost the box
2682,4.0,good phone at this price
2683,2.0,if you compare it with mi earphone of rs bass of this jbl is quite less than mis earphone build quality is not that enough good in jbl to satisfy because mi earphones build quality is enough good they covered wire with something like cloth or microphone quality is also not good in jbl mis earphone is value for money but this jbls earphone is some how feels like i paid more to get common features
2684,4.0,i bought this dress in red for a wedding i love the lasercut design and the fit overall is good except as another reviewer wrote the psuedoempire waste is likely not awesome for anyone with an average to longer torso i have a super long torso and the dress still works but a lower waist would have taken it from good to wow love the innovative take on a classic silhouettedesign though and the red is gorgeous
2685,2.0,speaker was finebutthe battery backup was not fine
2686,5.0,looks sleek and does its job
2687,1.0,only battery is good rest the screen and color and quality is way way behind wrt its specifications
2688,3.0,if we compared with boat the sound quality is not good boat will get around rupees
2689,2.0,runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it
2690,5.0,never expected something so good yet economical kevin smart led is the right choice as it certainly has smart features with amazing picture quality
2691,2.0,terrible speaker sounds like a tin can and very quiet
2692,5.0,i think these jeans are amazing they are very flattering and most of all comfortable i often will go up a size when buying white but i didnt have to with these they also relax very nicely as you wear them buying white jeans has always been a challenge often they are to thin and not that flattering i dont feel the same about these they are the perfect summer white jean i think i need another pair
2693,1.0,leptop speed too slow bettery power too poor and processor too poor quility i dont like this item

2696,1.0,not good is very bed producta
2697,3.0,over all the phone is good but the battery performance is terrible the battery drains out in hours of normal usage even while using the battery saver mode
2698,3.0,nothing so special its just overrated price too much for this mobile
2699,3.0,usb cable not working need to improve the usb cable quality power bank perform well
2700,5.0,i think in the low budget mobiles the samsung m series is the best series samsung galaxy m is the best mobile under range the v infinity display is given awesome look the camera is super quality of images are too good the wide angle given you a awesome picture the battery life is just awesome the mah battery given you to day battery life the samsung processor is too good after using of months i would say the mobile is overall awesome in budget
2701,4.0,as stated by others this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again i would have given it stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer the sleeves are indeed long although this adds to the coziness but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been im looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here congratulations retailer for a winner
2702,1.0,ive been shopping at retailer since and floreat used to be my favorite designer but for the past year or more floreat mostly misses the mark this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model it is long on her not so in real life this is probably the worst part about this blouse if it were not for this i might try on a size m and give it another chance it runs very large i usually take a l or xl i think i would need a m in this as mentioned above in the picture t
2703,5.0,i loved thisstylish n extraordinary performance

2709,2.0,it hangs its slower performance lagging feeling like gb ram phone although it has gb ram if u r using second space then it became dabba phone
2710,3.0,let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool it doesnt matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere it makes me itch so much that i just cant do it and i didnt not find this as itchy as others stated that being said you definitely need to size down i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric i still dont know what to think i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point
2711,1.0,one book found totaly weti disturbed with your delivery services

2713,2.0,very hard time getting it to work i keep getting i dont know about that a lot
2714,2.0,a big flop wifi and bluetooth not working even after updating its not getting connected dto any device never expected this from apple
2715,3.0,i really like the idea behind this top but at least for me the execution wasnt quite there i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace when it gapsyou move you can see a lot if you dont move the front panel is pretty opaque which is good i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i dont feel comfortable with the sheerness so i returned it i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked
2716,1.0,sounds west
2717,5.0,this shampoo helped my hair so much i was having issues with my hair falling out and breaking off after becoming obsessed with touching up my hair dye and leaving the dye in my hair longer and more frequent than i should have doing that to my hair caused it to break off at the roots due to the hair loss the spikes re growthbaby hairs became more noticableew not cute i watch a few youtube videos and found this line ive been using it for months now and can honestly say i see and feel a difference even my co workers have mentioned that my hair looks and feels thicker my hair has grown out so fast from when i had chopped it off last spring even the crazy spiky baby hairs have all grown out and now looks more normal around the crown of my head im using the sea weedkelp conditioner from the same brand because the store was oos on the conditioner version of that shampoo honestly thought the conditioner itself has made my hair really soft and supple love this line i will continue using it and will explore the other options they have as well
2718,3.0,could have been more accommodating to my needs
2719,1.0,phone is not working receiver not working and not able to take phone calls

2721,3.0,not loud enough music wish i would have bought the one a step above this one everything else works fine its a nice device but would rather have the large cylindrical speaker dont buy this if you want to play loudhigh quality music
2722,2.0,phone is nice but it started giving issue within week after purchase phone were getting automatically on airplane mode and calls gets disconnected sound system is low very low ringtone volume days ago showed at service centre now somewhere it is normal overall though it is at reasonable rate but my experience with redmi a is poor
2723,4.0,this dress does indeed run large like the other reviewers mentioned but it also runs small in the shoulders im and usually a size the xs fit perfectly in the body but was a little too small in the shoulders i liked the dress enough to size up to a small to fit the shoulders and then just had the sides taken in slightly i did purchase this dress during the off sale so that helped justify the cost of alterations
2724,3.0,good product but voice is low comparative to other speaker
2725,4.0,packaging was very cheap and very very poor i dont expect the type of packaging from amazon amazon team please maintain your quality but overall mobile is good since box is damaged my mobile is little bit damage
2726,2.0,if you use only cable then it will fast charge the device else power output would be aa look for something else

2732,4.0,not up to the mark little be manufacturing fault
2733,1.0,i cant get my cashback
2734,1.0,high quality performance is not available to redmi a this model is the failure redmi a is performance very poor and not available headphone jacket and not available memory expendables worst phone
2735,2.0,this product doesnt do much for me seems like it must be using a search engine from the s or something im sure if youve got prime and want to buy something it will find it lickety split but the most frequent response that i get is sorry i dont know that one for instance i asked it the distance between boulder co and hays ks and thats the response i got kind of lame
2736,4.0,very long so may need to hem if your inseam is under beautiful trousers
2737,2.0,while i love the design and shape of this blouse the fabric was of very poor quality i will return it

2743,1.0,after days its not working
2744,3.0,overated but gets the job done for when i wanna control my home lights
2745,4.0,writing the review after days samsung ms is good in many aspects i am using gb variant considering its huge battery for me it last more than a day on a single full charge a really good processor with faster app opening smooth running and ram management is too good and the display of the phone is more than awesome the another main highlight is camera its one of the best camera in this range and the super steady mode in the video will make you fall in love i have attached few photos too on the other hand there are some cons too which pulled me to give star ie tge phone heats within minutes of pub g playing or other heavy games the front camera is mp though it lacks sharpness the biggest con is its plastic back thank you i hope this review will be helpful
2746,1.0,here i would like to inform about the product i received from apple within weeks i got below issues camera not opening have to switch off and on when i open message window there is black line on left hand side speaker doesnt providing clear sound kindly fix these asap and contact me below number
2747,2.0,i was very excited to add this memory card to my g and finally not have to worry about used up memory anymore this was short lived however as maybe a few months had passed when the memory card refused to write anymore data i tried formatting it never could wipe it using it in a thumb drive reader kwpould not delete data all to no avail luckily the data i had on it was still salvageable
2748,4.0,fingerprint is slow camera good battery life super display good
2749,3.0,pretty rigid but charging is slow
2750,4.0,i wanted to write a review on this product because i see so many bad reviews today i tried out this shampoo to spot wash my bangs wich is the most greasy part of my hair i was plesently suprised that my bangs came out decently clean and silky smooth i think this shampoo is great for fine medium full hair that needs to be tamed down a little bit however for best results i dont think conditioner needs to be used with it and i also think that its a good idea to have a second shampoo thats less heave to swich back an fourth form but overall i belive this is a good product
2751,2.0,im a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small so i ordered this in a small and the top was a little loose but it was way too short theres no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public im and the hem was higher than midthigh on me the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape
2752,5.0,great product at low price working properly since last months
2753,3.0,i ordered this pants in white and black i read the reviews and werent that bad i am and lbs i got them in size small they are way too big the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe or i have to returned them quality is ok looking on my opinion

2760,1.0,this is bad product in the sense that it works for a couple of months and then one headphone stops working and after a few days the other one too stops working the worst thing is that the company sells this product under replacement warranty of one year meaning that they will replace the product within one ear but when you call their helpline no one picks up the phone the website does not work seems like a fraud company with fly by night ethics i had bought two headsets one for myself and one for my brother both of them stopped working within months

2792,4.0,i bought this for a beach getaway with the purpose of using it as a beach cover up it was great for this purpose however i also bought it thinking that i could use it as a dress during the summer i probably wont be using it for purposes other than the beach as it is extremely light weight and a bit sheer also although its hard to see it in the photo there are slits on the side of the dress all of these elements make it perfect for the beach when you want a breezy lightweight dress bu
2793,3.0,i bought the phone on the nd day of the sale oct st with an estimated delivery date of oct rd however to my surprise amazon delivered it the very next day i opened the phone and checked all the features and like almost all except one the rear camera which i was expecting to be better than others available in the similar price range however it really disappointed me the pictures taken from my old lenovo phone was way better than newly purchased samsung ms the worst part with the phones is that you cannot return it once bought i would expect samsung to improve the picture clarity in future updates however if it is not done then i am sure that i will never buy samsung phones in future and even would not even recommend it to my known ones

2887,5.0,fantastic quality i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices the fit is tts i am smaller on top than the bottom and size fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design i couldnt tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit i rea

2943,5.0,love it it has a nice creamy lather and actually feels kind of luxurious it gets my hair clean without stripping it or leaving any tacky residue behind i pair it with the matching conditioner and also have the moisture surge deep conditioner from this line and love them as well it leaves my hair clean hydrated and weightless this line literally makes my hair feel fluffy and voluminous im not sure if it would be moisturizing enough for anyone with extremely dry hair but its the perfect amount of moisture for my color treated dry hair after i use these products in the shower i use the organix moroccan argan penetrating oil on my towel dried hair then blow dry and my hair comes out weightless and silky every time highly recommend for anyone with my hair type i also really enjoy the awapuhi ginger and moroccan argan oil shampoo conditioners from this brand
2944,2.0,too poor camera quality mega pixel pics looks like mega pixelalso heating issue if you put on charging for hrsreported same issue within days of use to amazon they are mentioning return or replacement days policy but not ready to listen ones mobile sold telling to contact brand service centretoo bad experience with amazon and thr policy to make people fool by giving some discount

2950,2.0,i had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago but the problem im having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one they are all flawed in their construction i had eventually tried size s in the coral because each one was flawed on one one side hung longer than the other and on all the top design did not line up with the bottom design this blue one is the same way the top design does not line up with the bot
2951,5.0,xr awesome
2952,1.0,keeps loosing connection to the intranet
2953,2.0,because i have eczema on my scalp i decided to give organic shampoo a try this product was horrible i would say the only good thing about it was the smell and the fact that is was organic after using it my hair was super tangled when wet to the point where combing it was not even an option its not so bad after it dries though but still a bit tangly the end result is very dry and strawlike hair with a bit of frizz i will not be buying this product again its a shame because it smells wonderful i got many compliments for that

2961,4.0,i really love this shirt i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too its very comfortable and cute i got a lot of compliments when i wore it this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt so id advise everyone to size down

2980,2.0,quality of internal parts to store the bottles is very delicate hence i have returned the product
2981,2.0,as soon as you get up close to this sweater you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of materialalmost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all it wasnt for me at all even thou
2982,4.0,i havent tried the shampoo or conditioner but i am in love with the hair oil heres a good tip for all hair types mix a little bit of the hair oil with your normal conditioner not a deep conditionerhair mask and leave it in your hair for about minutes and then wash it out youll feel the difference in your after one wash while mixing the oil in my hair feel so smooth and soft up to days for extra moisture apply a pea size amount to your hair after the shower this oil is amazing and leaves my hair shiny and smooth

2995,3.0,i have received a gb ram mobile made in india and a gb ram mobile made in india now i am in a confusion which is the better
2996,2.0,i was very excited about this product when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected the print is just as lovely in person as it is online i dont even know if sizing up will mak
2997,4.0,all i would say is this is the best k tv you would get in this price range it has very good picture and sound clarity it has features like dolby and tru surround if you have likewise sound system you will experience theatre like environment i was able to install netflix but not prime video as it is not available on playstore but i can cast from redmi phone without any issue and there is no distortion in video or audio been using it for a month now and suggested my friend to buy it as well he is too very happy with the purchase
2998,5.0,its brilliant miraculous no idea how she works but she is so very helpful i have her in rooms
2999,5.0,good product very fast processor camera not best but more than good design superb
3000,4.0,amazing devicepronice audio quality for the size but see conmakes call to another amazon echo devices but see conconi said audio quality is nice for the size but volume is horrendous when ambient noise is little loud it can muffle the sound of the dotcannot make calls to people who has tap thats bummer since lot of my friends own tap
3001,4.0,pros camera has been improved by mi a lot in this version than prev version of phone the display is great looks immersive cons its battery life is not upto mark just after months of use i need to charge it twice a day
3002,3.0,slightly on the slower side than what has been advertised but still worth a buy
3003,4.0,i sized up on this one and im glad i did the slip for this dress is very small and in my normal size i doubt it wouldve have even covered what needs to be covered for a dress like this too work other than that this swing dress is adorable work appropriate and the pattern is sweet even though i ordered a instead of my usually the sleeves were a bit constricting but hit at the right spot i see myself throwing this easy little number on a lot
3004,1.0,over heating heating unbearable even for three minutes talk or even for trolling afraid item may explode if talktoll more than minutes feeble voice for both inwardoutward calls over heating if speakers are in on position defective piece so many conditions for replacement and ultimately not accepting replacement trying to convince through customer support dont by this product
3005,1.0,this is one sorry conditioner and its pretty rare of me to find conditioners that i just cant make work i used this conditioner with the accompanying shampoo to this line keep in mind that i have long mid backwaist length dense very thick and kinky hair i was excited to see a line at the drugstore that boasted no silicones or sulfates but when i went to use this conditioner after their shampoo which left my hair soft and still moisturized by the way i could feel the moisture being sucked out of my hair i like to only comb my hair when im in the shower conditioning and this conditioner made it impossible to do so this conditioner left my hair feeling knottier and drier than a shampoo how does that even happen needless to say this doesnt work for me at all must be for finer or less curly hair types even though i was sure a line with shea butter would do the trick for me i will not repurchase
3006,3.0,the camera is very poor quality dont know whats the use of triple camera and the sound of the speaker is also very poor only battery and charging seems good
3007,5.0,i always look for things to hide parts without making my parts look even more pronounced this top is much cuter in person than online it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didnt notice the length is perfect the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin even though it has stripes perfect spring summer top
3008,1.0,the worst product ever bought from amazonand shockingly the response from amazon was also the worst ever
3009,1.0,worst got a brand new firestick was not expected from amazon i am unable to configure it with my tv error unsupported signal check your device output need help asap wasted my sunday hoping that i could enjoy with the firestick i am from india and need to be contacted at
3010,4.0,i use the same mi k mah battery it worth for money and best product comparing this k power bank i wont think really its k mah of capacity whilst using i could charge my mobile in very less times only the pros is fast charging no heat issues easy to carry
3011,1.0,battery life is so poor and it is not value for money because of its battery life
3012,3.0,i bought a large bottle of this shampoo and conditioner even though i usually stick with the shea butter and argan oil line i suggest using them together instead of mixing and matching because the shampoo isnt as gentle as other organix products this conditioner was okay i didnt notice the sleekness or shine that i get from the shea and argan line though
3013,1.0,within months tv stoped working one month passed not yet repaired poor quality product very very poor service
3014,1.0,there are two rear camera one camera only working there is no expandable memory slot there is no additional options on camera
3015,1.0,i used an mi hrx edition earlier i should say it was really good though there was no heat rate monitor the step counts were accurate the mi band is a failure in that i received a band first which i think was already used the step counts were in accurate and i returned it the second one was worse in case of step counts when i move my hand simply it records step there are much more options in this model like call rejection message readability etc but the basic thing is faulty i want to return this one too
3016,3.0,wonderful pencil skirt with subtle design to pair with a variety of tops or sweaters fabric is nice and has a true fitted design however the sizing is all off it runs small and too long im and wait in denim and a p in most skirts the is too tight and past the knee in length more like upper calf the would be way too long disappointed
3017,4.0,sandisk chips are pretty good but relatively expensive at timesyoud think that online prices would be more affordable it can be but you can not tell if the seller is selling a fake product ot notthe one i received was genuine any of sandisk products can be returned and exchanged for another if genuine so ive not had a problem in exchanges with the company knocks on woodthe gb version works well with android tablets but not the gb versions so beware i did read online at other forums that the gb version works relatively well though with android phones which is weirdwhy would it work on the smartphone but not the tabletprices have dropped so it may have come down in prices at local retail stores so do shop around
3018,3.0,i loved the way this top looked in stock photos the colors are bright and cheery and its a great transition piece but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings if that makes sense they are stiff and wide and awkward ive worn this a few times hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down they havent maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something
3019,2.0,im and bough a size regular this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff cute pattern but im returning it
3020,3.0,cellular connection is not that good i am facing difficulties in internet connectivity this was not the case with my previous phone so i think its some fault in a
3021,4.0,i am writing this review after using months and trust me its a very good product and still in good condition and also working good
3022,3.0,i love this blouse ive received so many compliments on it unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow it also ate away some of the fabric so now its completely transparent and i go to an organic cleaners retailer if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic

3025,2.0,ugh i cant even explain how dry this made my hair i have thin hair thats been through the ringer in the past with bad bleach jobs and dreads but this honestly made my hair feel even thinner than it already is and completely dry even after conditioning my whole head my cheap as crap herbel essences shampoo did a better job i bought it because of the reviews on here and the fact that so many people said it smelled like the fragrance pink sugar i didnt really find that it did at all or at least its not noticeable enough to care for it it wasnt cheap either i think its overpriced and way overhyped i always seen girls post pictures from this line on to instagram but i havent really had good experiences with any of their products i have tried so far honestly it was a waste of money and its probably going to end up under my bathroom sink with the rest of my crappy products lol
3026,4.0,love the smell cleans nicely doesnt leave buildupresidue not so great for detangling though definitely will repurchase
3027,3.0,the phone is really good overall but the cons are the battery backup is terrible and it supports fast charging but fast charging also affects the phones performance
3028,3.0,despite other reviewers comments on size i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it im typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit id said for more for a b if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it a final comment on this suit it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed it was reticketed and it didnt really feel brand new when it arrived
3029,5.0,awsm
3030,1.0,battery back up worsti suggest dont bought this phone is but backup is wt a idiot apple companythis is cheating to customers
3031,1.0,beautiful fabric with soft drape unfortunately the captain kangaroo pockets are awful unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people dont want added bulk very disappointing returned

3035,2.0,i purchased three echo dots and have had nothing but trouble with them the first one took me five hours to set upon my wifi network at home and it has been a month and i still cannot get the other two set up why is it such an issue needs to be simpler to setup
3036,1.0,product not afctive
3037,2.0,i loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape i was frustrated that it didnt have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head the fabric was stiff and seemed to be lace over cotton not entirely sure i couldnt get past the feeling off the material
3038,1.0,too complicated to complete the activate
3039,3.0,i love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious
3040,1.0,for the past two months i caanot use the power bank properly since its usb prt is not working well i need to press hard each and everytime to get the mobile charge and i need to hold it tightly to get charged i am fed up with the chargerthe usb is prt is getting loose and it cannot hold tightlyi think i made a mistake buying this product

3042,3.0,delivered within hours review after hours of usages pros excellent battery backup stunning display decent front camera performance cons no headphones no multiuser the fast charger provided is really slow takes about hours slight heating is observed after about mins of imo video call camera is just okay little disappointed verdict good buy compared to cheep chainese product on the price band will add after few days of usages note you may need to set the display property to vivid and enable blue light setting s to get optimal colors attached is the pics clicked from oneplus and ms
3043,2.0,material is thin with a fleece like feeling on the inside hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward shows way too much would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath
3044,2.0,and not in a good way everywhere i went i left a little of this sweater behind within hours of having it on i was picking balls of fabric off the couch bed and the sweater itself looked like it was molting great style fabric and fit although a little on the long side but theres no way i can keep it
3045,3.0,the top is huge i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly i was really disappointed as i loved it in every other way
3046,4.0,superb quality phone i m loving it
3047,4.0,this is a very pretty particularly youthful dress but do be forewarned it is gigantic size down even if you never do and get a petite if you are even a little short i didnt size down enough and it was both wide and long it looked ridiculous i am petite and the hem went way below my knees and the dress was considerably longer than the slip
3048,1.0,bluetooth range is very low honest it is just average quality product and somehow bluetooth not working properly in my piece
3049,4.0,id say these are exactly aspictured and im happy with them they run a little big in the waist i most often wear xspetite in retailer sizes and can often wear xs regular but these are a bit loose i have a waist hips the drawstring tie solves that of course but its only in the front it doesnt go all the way around the waist the rest is elastic id also say these are highrise or long in the crotch but im only so theyre probably midrise on tall people i have them hi
3050,5.0,got these in my usual size and they are wonderful the gray goes with everything im hoping they come out with some greens or blues too
3051,1.0,i m dislike this mobile brightness are always full and low is showingno option to off auto brightness app mi remote is not there dual app is not there finger print not responding proper mobile size is small not liked app lock is not there in mobile flash light power is not so good
3052,4.0,i just had an incident with my galaxy s phone however where the chip became corrupt is it the chip is it the phone i put one of these in my samsung phone and another in my samsung tablet all is well except for that one time where the chip and phone got funny with each other and i had to erase all my music the phone was able to format erase prepare the chip so it was immediately usable but i did lose my music very weird well all i have to do is sync my music to my phone no big deal
3053,3.0,you have to learn to ask the question correctly else you do not get the info you wantedoverall i like alexa i got this as a gift and i am happy with it
3054,3.0,i have a mixed feeling about this cardigan on one hand i like it on the other hand there are some minor things i do not like first i love its knit pattern especially the pattern on the back second i like a soft color of this cardigan on website pictures two motifs look almost the same in reality brown motif is light pinkish while blue motif is light bluegreenish third texture this cardigan is made of linen and cotton so it feels comfortable to wear if there are flaws
3055,1.0,batry performance is very bad
3056,3.0,the fabric so diaphanous so flowy the pattern so pretty with such interesting colors it could literally go with anything purple yellow orange green theyre all in there but heres the but i have no waist and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me i look like im wearing a sack or i have some pregnancy newswhen i dont i tried belting it waist tie is too high i tried putting on a vest too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves while adding
3057,3.0,battery wah not give good backup
3058,4.0,what can i say its a memory card it remembers what its supposed to at least it remembers as well or better than i doonly problem i have with these micro sd cards is theyre so small theyre easy to lose if these things get any smaller we will start inhaling them by accident when we sneeze or something
3059,1.0,i was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me it was very wide bust down and made me look lbs heavier im and lbs ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say its tts up top
3060,2.0,it have slight screen flickering at low brightnessmaybe its pwm flickering which is harmful for eyes and once i faced rapid flickering while gaming even at higher brightness and installation of drivers are so confusing no one is sure whether to download it from amd site or asus site and no one knows which is most compaitable i have requested a replacement and if the problem persists i will ask a refund
3061,3.0,got this on sale in black and red and have only worn the black quality is poor seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down not worth full price
3062,3.0,i tried this treatment because my friend raved about it and said her hair had never been so smooth so i tried it and am not impressed it isnt thick and my hair doesnt even feel conditioned afterwards much less what i would expect after a conditioning treatment i do have curly somewhat damaged hair maybe my friends hair was just healthier to begin with and that why she got hg results
3063,4.0,beautiful color great styledesign only drawback is its not as soft as other cashmere ive purchasedgot the xs and the fit is perfect
3064,4.0,aevarage
3065,1.0,please do not buy this product i have read the reviews on it after i bought it so i proceeded to use it although some reviewers did say it will ruin the haircolour well it did ruin my newly coloured haircolour it turned awful red this was the biggest waste of money and time it also ruined the texture of my hair in addition to colour the hair is very thin now please please do not buyuse this i can only hope my hair will go back to normal with time
3066,5.0,love this jacket it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time i was surprised at how affordable it was my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color
3067,4.0,the redmi pro is among the best mobiles you can buy at this price range let me put down some of the pros and cons of this mobile pros value for money good design and build quality size is perfect rear camera is good its the same setup as in redmi note pro fhd screen with notch display good battery life and no heating issues face recognition fingerprint login dedicated micro sd card slot you can have micro sims and an sd card cons the front camera is just average and its bad in low light conditions snapdragon is a bit old now its been around a while nothing much new apart from the notch display in this phone so if youre not a fan of notch display then you can ignore it not meant for high intensity graphic games i dont play games but i tested pubg and it was below average im not fan of miui too many advertisements and its another revenue model for xiaomi the company has admitted its one way to reduce the cost of mi phones same old micro usb port no type c its fine since you dont see type c port at this price range face unlock is average it works only with good lighting sunlight screen visibility is pathetic you cant see anything outdoors under bright sunlight overall i found redmi pro a very good phone as ive mentioned earlier there is nothing much new apart from the notch display when compared to other mi phones
3068,3.0,sound quality is on poor side always to keep at volume
3069,5.0,i feel like im cheating when i put this on its so comfy almost like wearing cozy pjs but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like im lounging at the same time i wish this came in more colors
3070,1.0,product itself is good i bought it from india store and it is a nd generation model i live in uae dubai where this does not work so i am stuck with this product not able to watch prime video on my tv i cant return it because i dont live in india and amazon uae wont replace it for me money waste effort waste and not able to watch prime on my tv netflix is so much better with no restrictions and controls like this
3071,4.0,this is a great beachpool or lounge piece i debated keeping but couldnt pass up how comfortable it was hugging without being tight i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but its so comfortable straps are a bit long
3072,4.0,nice and easy to use
3073,5.0,yay i love this stuff a lot of oils have left my hair heavy and greasy but not this stuff it really nourishes the hair and keeps it looking healthy and glossy when i first used this product it felt like my hair belonged on a pantene commercial no joke i just follow the directions on the back the product and viola price is great in comparison to other argan oils and the packaging looks a little too bulky for me but whatever great product
3074,5.0,this sweatercoat is great it super comfortable its perfect for my california winters it could be layered for colder areas this piece definitely runs large like really large i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium it is meant to be boxy and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering id definitely say go in store and try it on youll love it
3075,1.0,it hangs more than a k mi phone apple sucks now
3076,2.0,bettery failed
3077,3.0,this dress is beautiful made with highquality fabric unique design and color etc but it fits so weird i am hourglass shaped so this dress seemed pretty ideal but i just couldnt make it work it was heavy and awkward feeling when on the clasp at the breast would definitely not stay closed long and would undoubtedly need replacing sooner than later the sleeves are too fluttery and long the dress itself is just too bulky and has too much of that beautiful fabric maybe a really tall s
3078,5.0,one of the most comfortable tops i own fits loose such a soft fabric looks cute love it
3079,5.0,these pants fit comfortably and are really nice on theyre not too bulky and can be worn in a casual way andor with a formal look i just wish black jeans didnt always have that odd rubber smell other than that these are great

3086,3.0,well this is my first k tv so i am satisfied with its features and performance for the price range its worth it i had issues when i purchased the tv due to it being a festival season last month i had a delay with the installation but everything was done smoothly once the technician arrived it is true that the performance does lagsometimes due its limitated gb ram k videos play smoothly no issues the photo i uploaded is a video of p k no issues or lag it does the job of a k tv would suggest to go for a smaller tv according to your room and dont get carried away by the size its been exactly a month and no issues till now although i had to format the software once due to a unsupported app as it kept throwing errors on the screen anyways the tv is good we always remember the cons more than the positives
3087,3.0,this is one of the best potential dresses ive seen from retailer but it needs a doover im usually a in this style of dress but i sized up to a the largest size and couldnt even button the top even if i had been able to do so i would have worn it as a tunic i am and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most smallbreasted of people that said if the company were to try again ne

3161,4.0,i agree with the other reviewers about the versatility and the fit of the dress i am and yes the pockets hit just a tad high but the fit of the bodice and bust is so great that i am willing to overlook this small flaw the only thing that has really bothered me about the dress that i havent seen anyone else comment on is the slightly strange odor from the denim maybe it just happens to be my particular dress but i have noticed this strange smell from a pair of seven jeans i had purcha

3168,5.0,nice quality soft fabric sleeves definitely make a unique statement the fit worked for me although it could have more room in hips for my hourglass figure got m size l was way too big i am d but the dress can definitely accomodate bigger chest the color are my favorites in this season wear it to stand out
3169,4.0,its a good phonebelow given are the pros and cons after having used it for months pros best price google updates the phone much faster almost every month average camera for this price point infrared remotenot everyone uses it though average display not so bright under the direct sunlight situations usb type c cons bad battery life phone keeps crashing when it hits gb of ram usage itself my phone is having gb of ram you can buy gb ram that might not have this issue no mm headphone jack no fast charging
3170,5.0,as every one knows one plus is a great device
3171,5.0,wow very nice picture quality
3172,4.0,after using battery backup little down now price down i purchased on first sale for phone good can i replace for gb ram is it possible
3173,3.0,okay so im pretty conflicted about this product i bought this on a whim a little while back and just tried it out tonight i have the shampoo and conditioner so i figured id give it a try i will say that the experience while washing and conditioning my hair with this stuff was odd especially the conditioner however once my hair was dry it was super soft it took my nothing to brush my hair out which was a bonus for me considering i always dread brushing my hair after i was it cause i know its going to be full of knots this stuff though left my hair feeling amazing the only reason i probably wont repurchase this is due to the smell i obviously smelt it when i bought it and in the bottle it had that quotsea typequot smell but it didnt seem too overwhelming however now that ive washed my hair its all i can smell its a mixture of old lady perfume and salt is the best way i can describe it the smell is sooo strong that its almost making me want to rewash my hair with something else im hoping i can look past the smell since this product works wonders for my hair but so far its impossible to overlook
3174,2.0,i had held high hopes for the product considering it had argan oil in it however i was disappointed with very ho hum results the product is a thickish white cream with a rather nice scent it applied and combed through my hair smoothly and rinsed out easily something i always look for in a conditioner it made my hair feel neither better nor worse maybe a little softer but certainly no marked change i wanted to be fair so i used it twice more still nothing it was a little pricey especially for results or lack thereof there a many treatments available that are half the price and work twice as well pros nice smell and feel cons made no improvement to my hair pricey for what it is
3175,1.0,one of the wrost mobile ever from redmi phone has no saprate earphon jacku can use only earphon or charger at one tym no memory card slot nither saprate nor hybridbattry life is pathetic backup hrs when internet is on
3176,2.0,did not get the pin to open the sim slot
3177,5.0,good speaker
3178,3.0,the product is far more slower than other laptops with i and similar configuration my first dell purchase ended in disappointment
3179,1.0,bought it for camera is just on paper picture quality is just mp even a phone clicks better than thisfront camera is super pathetic its mp dont buy this item guys go for other options its a worst choice wastage of money pros just one pro ie mah battery but for that battery backup you will not throw away your hard earn rupees cons camera quality is big draw back in k you will get redmi note pro realme xxt with better camera quality than this panel is of low quality plastic which is giving crackling sound which is annoying and worrisome waste of money please dont buy samsung ms camera clarity was not satisfied its not a mp camera looks like mp feeling bad about samsung ms please dont buy it
3180,2.0,while out and about in a photo shoot i had this card fail on me luckily im a backup freak and was just starting out for the day so i only lost a few pictures card completely died and had to be sent back to sandisk for a replacementthe whole process took a little over a week and communication was excellent so stars on sandisk supporti know about memory so i always have multiple cards available and if im out for an extended time spread my work out over cards to minimize riskwhat about the average person who throws all their data on this disk and looses precious memories sure they are at fault for not backing up their data unless you are shooting hd videos though chances are youre not going to fill this card up in a dayunless you either need the storage for hd video or something or your data is not important id say it makes more sense to just get several gb cards equaling gb at roughly the same or less price depending on brandagain sandisk support was great and they even asked if i needed data retrieved i cant recommend this card though
3181,5.0,the features provided by samsung in this price range is superb the display is awesome really liked samsung after long time
3182,1.0,dont get carried away with the reviews i am a prime customer but received the product only after days i tried charging my power bank for the past days still not even also it stared getting too hot that i feared it could burst returning the product
3183,5.0,the liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over ones head it contains wool but is not in the least itchy in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric it would be cute with a patterned bottom like a plaid or dotted pants as shown doesnt seem to be easy to snag
3184,4.0,hi useing from past months regularlygood experience almost time change mah mobile only problem is when charge mobile on this power bank charge discharged fast i mean if you have days battery backup on your original charger and you charge mobile on this power bank you get charge over all good cheers

3188,5.0,i love this top i typically wear a size small and this is very true to size its loose fitting but does not make you look large the pattern on the material is also fun without being too busy perfect for fall
3189,3.0,good product at a very competitive price
3190,2.0,not at all meeting expectations i still have my year old lenovo which performs better than this one it keeps getting frozen at everything has some major issues especially for a brand new laptop that too for a brand like hp i havent even installed anything big or major to slow it down soo much its only a few months old im searching for my warranty information to return or get it replaced im regretting choosing this over lenovo bcuz i was getting a good deal or so i thought
3191,4.0,prompt delivery by amazon the colour body are simply as expected the front camera could have been better but at this price range you cant expect much the gb storage could have been increased to atleast gb though i am not a gaming person but for browsing etc the phone works fine a con i must mention is the positioning of the speaker if the phone is kept on a surface we always do that the ring of the phone becomes extremely diminished involume but for this range you can blindly go for it
3192,1.0,waste of moneyit is out of order just in days no service provided by service centre simply stating water damage it is non repairableno guidance for return the productbye online be helpless
3193,4.0,not up to the expectation
3194,2.0,the laptop came with loads of preloaded bloatware and software that completely slowed it down i had to do a clean install of windows which brought out the speed and performance of the laptop
3195,2.0,its my first purchase of samsung galaxy smartphone its ms previously used other brands like motorola nokia xiaomi vivo as it was global brand i trusted and expected more from the specs advertised or mentioned but from st day of delivery i found it was defective yes defective product delivered by amazon india coming to device review only display samoled with full hd was good and some how the one ui was good battery backup was like mah only processor heats a lot upto degree and consumes more power power hungry processor so battery lasts less time product was feel like cheap because poor build quality makes back panel and sides crackling sound even one ui having ads yes but it can be stopped when initial setup of device to not to receive any marketing information unlike xiaomi cameras also above average front camera is below average only overall not expected from samsung brand for the display only i am giving stars rest was a crap because of overheating of device when using normally without gaming and battery drains a lot in idle also

3205,3.0,i bought this product from local apple authorised store and this is what i feel after using it for almost days now they say it has superior hardware like better processorcamera and battery life with additional features like waterproof and dust proof compared to iphone s practically it makes no differerence at all except for camera any application you run in iphone and iphone s takes same time and also same time to copy files etc what is the meaning of superior hardware if it makes no difference compared to its predecessors this hardware etc is just selling point of this phone as its battery life is same as iphone s too if you are upgrading from iphone s or to iphone then it could be worth but if you are upgrading from s then it is completely waste of money for iphone splus users i say wait for iphone s
3206,3.0,very good product thanks to amazon for fastest delivery camera quality of the product is very good but battery life is soo poor disply is also good look very premium quality

3213,2.0,like most other volumizing shampoos this one seems to work by blowing open the hair shaft not the best thing for color treated or dry hair i really love the scent but its way to harsh for hair even with the conditioner my hair feels like straw after dry and coarse
3214,4.0,i tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit it fits in the most beautiful flattering way red looked gorgeous rich glossy fabric this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it i have never seen a fabric like that it almost looked coated red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me so i decided to order the produ
3215,3.0,i purchased this phone through maple store in cash in april now my phone is hanged is quality of phone not up to mark
3216,4.0,a very good conditioner which softens and moisturizes my hair i use it straight after the coconut milk shampoo its quite emollient and rich in texture but yet doesnt leave my hair and scalp oily like most other conditioners do it also doesnt weight it down or make it frizzy not to mention it smells literally like heaven if you like coconutscented things then youll love this my only wish is that it would last longer than the hour or so that it does price is also good i can usually pick up a oz bottle for just under usd from target which is brilliant value considering how long one bottle lasts for my only complaint has to be the bottle itself no matter how much i try and shake the conditioner out i just cannot get the last onefifth or so out of the bottle and end up cutting the bottle in half just to scoop out whats left not that this is a pricey conditioner i just dont like unnecessary wastage other than that its hard to fault this and ill definitely be repurchasing selena x my top hg list as ive tried s of skin hair and mu products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top musthave products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm pigmentation antiaging serum divine herbal facial treatment serum cleanser paulas choice skin balancing cleanser concealer mac studio finish concealer lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash foundationspf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream moisturizer lush enzymion hand cream origins make a difference

3227,1.0,i knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first thank goodness for that at first glance i knew i wouldnt be buying this the construction leaves much to be desired from the flimsy single layer of unlined unstructured fabric to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim

3236,3.0,this is not worth it looks cute on butthere is no support in the bust area just a slight tuck in the fabric it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning ill look for something else i havent bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasnt slipped i will look for another option
3237,1.0,over rated in flexibility and versatility started using it and found the limitations very quickly not worth the money or time
3238,1.0,no way to format it i even downloaded programs that claimed were able to format it after wasting about hours i decided to give up and send it back the seller should format them before sending them even if they would charge extra it would be well worth it instead of the hassle of downloading programs and wasting time trying and sending it back after hours of frustration

3242,5.0,im amazed i ordered this from amazon on tuesday morning and it arrived with wednesdays mail very impressive service from amazonas has already been reported the card formats out to gb and it performs perfectly in my samsung galaxy s iii which is also new using two card readers on a fast pc i transferred everything from my old gb card to the new gb card in less time than it took to walk to the kitchen and get a cup of coffee so i think the class rating is correct on the cardonce i have some experience with the card in the phone ill benchmark the card and ill also benchmark operations such as internally backing up my android phone to the card then ill update this review with some accurate numerical data but in the mean time on first look the person who said that the s has problems with anything faster than class may not have been correct a full backup of the phone to the card was significantly faster than the backup with the old gb class card again no benchmarks yet but once i have them ill include them hereright now im very happy with this card and im really impressed both with the card and with the unbelievably quick service from amazon and im in atlanta where shipments like this one often take the full days to arrive

3308,4.0,at the price redmi is available compared with price features are good like sound quality battery life etc
3309,5.0,first saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular the length hits right below my bum so its perfectly structured to wear with leggings the cable knit is super soft and very warm wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price
3310,1.0,ive just purchased two redmi phone from amazon in the eve of gifestival septoct and being a prime customer got the phone just next day in kolkata thanks amazon however my main motive to write the review is i found few very very suspicious things while configuring the phones being a lazy writer i never write review but this time i found this should be known to everyone including amazon ill put the same is social media also i told i bought phone in first phone i have given all permission while configuring initial setup then i checked for any firmware any system updates are required or not there was no update i recorded the version number then i started configuring the nd phone this was to be used for phone banking and credit card activity thats why i have restricted few permissions during initial setup and then i checked system update section the version was same as previous but now it was telling to update my system during update i found lot of patches has been installed very very syspecious why everytime my activity will be monitored if im not willing to please think
3311,5.0,very nice music quality

3313,4.0,i really loved the uniqueness of this dress and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work but it was just a little too fitted for the office
3314,2.0,refurbished product sold as a brand new product bad bad quality
3315,4.0,i was hoping this dress was a bit thicker but when i tried it on the fabric was very thin and sheer because of the body skimming design this dress likely wont work on many without some serious spanx or body trimming hosiery if you work out and are very fit you might like it but i dont so im not that brave lol
3316,4.0,i absolutely love the look style of this piece perfect for summer evenings only complaint is that it feels maybe a bit too delicate fabric is quite lightweight and may be easy to tear i will be taking special care of this hoping to keep it looking great for the season
3317,1.0,this dress has pretty colors the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella it has enough material to make skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways the photo of model is from side not the front very unflattering on me
3318,5.0,i rarely need it just for backup and rare conditions its a good buy though if u are a tech enthusiast id advice to go for mah power bank of same brand
3319,3.0,dont buy this phone its waste of money and build quality is not good phone function is very slow actually gb variant phone you wont feel like its gb really am unhappy with this phone

3321,1.0,i had this sandisk gb class micro sdhc card in a pittasoft blackvue drgwhd incar camera dvr it worked like a champ for months and then died with the dreaded please format the sd card errors stuck it in my mac mini and it is unrecognizable same with windows pc even the low level hp sd card formatter cannot reformat it so in the garbage it goes i have more of these cards in my garmin gps devices and they continue to work so far but they are not being written to continually every day like the blackvue so a word of advice if you need to write to these cards often buy something else
3322,5.0,new
3323,4.0,this was was a great buy i got in on sale and the quality is really excellent the material is thick and stretchy there is a spanx like liner which is really nice as well for smoothing out the bumps the dress style and cut is very slimming i am more a size at and the fit well i agree with the other reviewer regarding the twisted shoulder it doesnt lay on me either like it does on the model but it doesnt detract from the dress so its a keeper given the other positives
3324,1.0,worst product and that too coming from brand like samsung no pros only cons for this mobile device so called unbreakable phone started giving issue with its pixels without any physical damage it started with frequent prompt of moisture being detected at usbcharging port this came as complete shocker as device was not even moist or came in contact with any water particles post couple of days of prompt device started losing its pixels without any physical damage to the screen recent scenario is device is behaving weirdly without any physical damage to the screen samsung service center is not ready to accept the complaint or even ready to take a look at the reported issue being launched recently samsung are not prepared at all with the device or services same issue has been detected with m which was purchased by my friend at the end post month of purchase i am being told to fixed the display even thought there is no issue with display rs purchase now giving additional rs of expense despite of any issue samsung service center or customer support are of no use i would suggest to go with moto or mi for the purchase instead of this poor device and so called samsung brand
3325,3.0,color not as vibrant as in the picture skirt is darted which is not clearly seen in the picture assumed would be cut on the bias which im more familiar with in slip dresses i didnt fill in the bust and the style is such that it isnt possible to compensate with helpful undergarments while not for me im still recommending it because it may fit others better reviewers are instructed to avoid writing about customer service but i feel compelled to note that the customer service i have
3326,4.0,if you want to try out wearable mi band is a very good start it has good battery life and is water proof havent liked the notification management so it moreover stick to basics of step and sleep tracking watch would have preferred to see the time without touching the button the wrist flick doesnt really work in real life
3327,1.0,very bad mobile do not buy camera quality very bad more than hours take to fully charged
3328,4.0,nice twist on a basic tshirt pictures dont tell the full tale better in person bought the cream one loving it
3329,3.0,well i was disappointed in the fabric for this dress it is a heavier material and i suspect will not be very cool comfortable during warmer weather when i would normally wear a sleeveless dress on the upside the pattern is really pretty
3330,4.0,this is a beautiful sweater but if came up weirdly high on me in back higher than it looks on the model she must have on high waisted pants
3331,2.0,when you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress the stripes are diagonal however that is not the case with the dress in person the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation alas not very flattering so back it goes
3332,3.0,mob is osm but mp camera not enough quality normal pic
3333,5.0,i have two of these that i use in my asus infinty tableti have one in an sd adapter in the dock and the other in a microusb adapter in the dock
3334,2.0,this shampoo smells great and left my hair silky and shiny but also caused a terrible allergic reaction i have sensitive skin and immediately felt a burning sensation when i used this shampoo and conditioner i washed them off quickly but still my lips and face swelled up and i had chapped lips and angry red eczema on my neck hands scalp and face for days i would advise that you stay away from this range if you have sensitive skin
3335,2.0,like most people here i wanted this beautiful dress to fit so i decided to see for myself if maybe just maybe the negative reviews were wrong they werent if you have any sort of breasts at all the top probably wont fit properly i imagine a narrow upper torso like a or possibly a might find the top part of the dress closes properly but with a c i could not get a size to button up the waist hit at a strange spot and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
3336,2.0,this dress either runs large or just has too much fabric ordered my usual size but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me embroidery pretty but background is more of a muddy gray then denim as shown if the smaller size in petite was available id have exchanged it but it is going back
3337,4.0,good product worth for money
3338,1.0,hour battery life on full charge slow as hellwould have returned but exceeded the days window sheer waste of money
3339,5.0,i dont know price will drops
3340,1.0,on flipkart its lesser without being on sale
3341,4.0,too small in comparison to the size expected seeing on amazon sound is good for listening in car but not so good for rooms
3342,3.0,picture quality is just average basic options such as infra video calling and some other options are unavaliable lack of picture sharpness and zoom is less avergae phone for k only advantage is fast processor kirin
3343,2.0,this dress runs very large i am and lbs hourglass curvy build i ordered a size small and its enormous on me the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all its like a big wool sack id have to gain lbs for this dress to come close to fitting im very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes including petite i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available the dress lo
3344,5.0,no question it is really as fast as its rated how fast well class sdhc means literally sd format hchigh capacity class mbsec readwrite how fast is mb per second well class the most common step down ie cheaper is class ie mbsec so class is times faster why pay the differencedigital cameras at some point the number of picturessec or hd video is bottlenecked by the speed of the media it is being recorded tosmart phones i have a samsung note ii a quadcore processor wizbang yaddayadda yes i do notice speed differences in camera app performance i use a spreadsheet appbrowsernetflixmusic streaming et al is noticeably faster where do you think the phone stores stuff to when it doesnt use the factory installed memory iphomes dont have an sd slot and i wouldnt own a phone or tablet that doesnt i believe in choice in the computer realmoh yeah sandisk is a leader and pioneer in the sd format where do you think the sd came from the only other sdhc class card worthy of comparison is the samsung brand but then i might be biased on that one
3345,3.0,i am so in love with this skirt but unfortunately it runs at least one size smallsince i am a there is no sizing up the color quality and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to juniors sizing than a regular womens size so sad because it will be going back
3346,5.0,i was looking for the maximum storage i could add to my sd card slot on my samsung galaxy s while samsung only recommends using standard microsd cards this microsdxc card works perfectly and offers great speeds if you need a card to expand your galaxy ss storage this is the goto card for you
3347,3.0,after using this product a few times i didnt notice any difference in my hair the bottle was very hard to use no matter how you grasped it it made also pressing the sprayer down difficult if you held it where the bottle was wide it was hard to grasp because of how wide the bottle is if you held it the narrow way you still had to have fingers around the widest part to keep it from flying out of your hand
3348,2.0,i was really disappointed with these pants they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist sadly they will be going back

3351,3.0,lasted about months of daily use in my android phone but yesterday it stopped performing writes and then failed altogether while it was working reads were incredibly fast and writes were pretty good as well
3352,4.0,love this tee the fit is true to size and very flattering shaping not too tight not too baggy good length i love the stitching detail on the top the material is thick enough that you are not forced to wear a cami under it my only concern is that it says to hand wash dry clean acceptable i have had some bad luck with retailer tops shrinking im not going to risk it and dry clean it normally i would not want that expense or hassle
3353,3.0,tilted pages cutting of paper isnt good quality is average

3358,3.0,those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture also the material is quite thin which makes the snug part look unflattering they were not for me unfortunately

3362,2.0,slowly developing but still have issues with smart home functions has issues with connectivity to internet and phillips hue
3363,3.0,i bought this product because i loved the way my friends hair smelled and she said this conditioner was her secret while the scent is nice this conditioner only gives good results during the spring and fall seasons when there is no humidity but once the rainy season and high summer are in swing i have to shelve it because it doesnt help with frizz at all i hate the packaging because it is so hard to squeeze out the last drops and cannot be stored upside down also ive learned that products that claim to contain argan oil need to have at least argan oil in their composition for them to be effective i dont think organix contains that much argan oil because other argan oil products give much better results in particular moroccan oil and josie maran so even though organix is cheaper i will not repurchase
3364,3.0,i got a samsung galaxy tab and i got this to increase memory i had hoped to transfer files from my macbook but it will not recognize the memory card i need to go to the apple genius bar to see if they can figure it out

3394,4.0,once i return the faulty product then new came good after sale service new product is working well accurate time and very easy to connect looking stylish on hand
3395,2.0,the battery life is very poor battery drains very fast in morning i charged the phone and by eod the battery life dropped to without usage since the phone is used by my mother their is no internet or applications running inspite of that the battery drains very rapidly
3396,3.0,this dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part front i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork design near my face all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx was too much to spend on this
3397,3.0,it feels soft and like a good quality however it really does run large and long i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didnt work out i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didnt also wrinkles easily

3401,1.0,i should have read the reviews first before ordering this top buyers beware you will not get the same top delivered to you as is shown in this picture the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all and while there is a bow in the back the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow i hate to write a bad review but come on retailer id never expect this from you it looks like any other peplum white top not something special like the picture is o
3402,5.0,was most awaited finally recieved it super excited
3403,3.0,visibility not good
3404,1.0,worthless poroduct
3405,3.0,i would have l loved to keep it but even the p was big i have pretty broad muscular shoulders and back and i was swimming it i wish retailer would stock more petites i would repurchase if the p was available they always sell out very very quickly and they never restock
3406,3.0,im usually a or size l in retailer and when i tried this on buttoning it up from the bottom i was so exciteduntil i reached the chest it was way too tight in the bust and i am not that big in that area it was painfully tight on my d chest its also unlined which makes it not very useful for anything other than the warmest times of year its a shame because the skirt is swishy and a good length many trenches are too short or not wide enough on the bottom for a fuller figure i
3407,5.0,the fabric is incredibly soft and has a good weight to it this is also pretty warm its not a down jacket but its as least as warm as a sweatshirt it fits close to the body in typical bomber jacket fashion im lbs and went with the large which fits well i always find myself wishing bomber jackets were just a tad longer and this is no exception but i cant really fault the jacket for that its true to the style
3408,4.0,if a fully charged power bank is left unused and unrecharged it will drain slowly
3409,5.0,dont think just buy this excellent battery back up and the wonderfull thing is that it can give you the fast charge if your mobile is supported
3410,4.0,st this jacket fits true to size nd the shoulders are too tight designnot sizing as other reviewers have noted its such a beautiful design and material so its unfortunate that the shoulders are so tight the jacket is a little impractical i purchased this jacket with off sale price im not sure its worth it for such oversight on shoulder mobility

3424,3.0,this would have been a perfect jacket for a trip im taking light weight and very stylish however the jacket runs huge the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big i wear a size mostly in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about past my natural shoulders i wont return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool i should have checked its unbearably itchy esp around the neck you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it

3454,4.0,ive had my gs frontier watch for weeks so i am ready to update some of my initial observations unlike a review that i read recently i wasnt expecting the unboxing to be an experience into itself needless to say the frontier isnt a rolex these were the positives that i found the setup is a breeze with my oneplus t even though the watch is fairly big at mm it didnt look large on my wrist maybe i was just prepared for the size but the features on the watch like the rotating bezel buttons and screen are well balanced maybe the dark color helps but it didnt look or feel big on my slender wrist by the way that rotating bezel is awesome i bet apple wishes they had thought different the watch faces that came with it were pretty nice compared to the funky ones that the s had i felt less of a compulsion to buy replacement ones although if you pay a few bucks there are a few good ones out there that are more functional than the stock watch faces the speaker on the watch rocks i left it at the default loudness setting of and i can hear calls perfectly the maximum call volume is i had my mom call me from the phone she is very softspoken and i could hear her perfectly you dont need to bring the watch close to your mouth to be heard clearly for all other sounds which are ringtone media notifications and system i left them set to maximum volume for those is again the speaker is pretty loud for such a small device i havent had a chance to test the altimeter but the speedometer and gps work very well i tested them with the free speedometer app and the speed matched that on my car dashboard i love hiking so itll be interesting to see how well the technology works and whether an app ecosystem can grow out of those features the screen looks really clear and bright i have brightness set to and the screen is perfectly readable indoors and in direct sunlight the s can let you control your favorite music app on your phone music is routed through your phone speakers or you can listen to tracks that are on the watch itself music is routed through the watch speakers or through attached bluetooth headphones check out spotify the s now has a native spotify app that frees you from having to interact with your phone if you setup wifi access and log into spotify premium from your watch you can stream music directly to it without having your phone with you or powered on this feature shows how the s is increasingly becoming a dependable device in its own right now onto the reasons why i gave it stars a maybe its the size of the rotating bezel in this larger watch face but it feels loose there is a slight wobble on the s but if you tap the rotating bezel on the s you can actually hear it sound as if it is loose maybe they can make it a bit tighter in the next model b the s voice assistant is very rudimentary in the age of siri alexa and even cortana samsung needs to catch up quickly with integrating ai into such an otherwise featurepacked watch whats the point of cramming in so much processing power if one is left with only a glorified phone dialer svoice needs to get smart c you need to own a samsung mobile phone if you want to use this watch to its full capacity or else you will be left wanting for more i own a one plus t samsung pay the best part of the watch oh man this is cool similar to android pay and apple pay it is a service where you can link your creditdebit card and pay using your smartwatch the gear s revolutionized this by claiming that you can pay at almost any store that has a card swipe reader even if the card swipe reader does not have nfc you can just hold your watch near the card swipe area and boom its done you will go through the initial setup which requires you to enable a pin pass code on your watch every time you take off your watch and put it back on or it senses inactivity you will have to enter your pin then you will go through the process of adding your creditdebit cards now you are all set you just hold down the top right button and select the card you want to use and hit pay place your watch near the nfc reader or card swipe performance samsung advertises that this watch can go days without charge moreover that might be true i tested it and i was able to get little over hours d h m s to be exact with left not bad it probably could have made it to days if i used power saving mode i was able to achieve the above battery performance by turning off automatic heart reading always on display and gps ps i purchased this watch from the usa for roughly rs which i feel is steal compared to the amount it retails for here in india i know the s is right around the corner but this purchase was made from the heart and not the brain ps attached a pic with my fossil q crewmaster for size purposes do give a thumbs up if you find the review helpful thanks
3455,2.0,i dont suggest bez its getting heat quickly with use of mins net battery getting heat
3456,3.0,doesnt always connect with drop in and often says unavailable aside from that it seems to work as expected disappointing because drop in was a big factor and often you cannot hear the person using the dot
3457,4.0,played pubg in ultra gives fps otherwise gives lowersettings the hz screen is good for gaming the gpu is a beast
3458,4.0,a very nice fall into winter tunic length is long enough to wear along line as a dress with tights and tall boots i found it true to size the color of slate blue is beautiful
3459,2.0,dress is pretty i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings nice but not nice enough to keep i am returning
3460,4.0,the product is nice i have purchased this item duly exchanging old lg refrigerator but while purchasing the item i have wrongly selected old refrigerator company as other but it is lg hence please review the exchange offer value by consider the old refrigerator model thanks in advance
3461,4.0,the battery of this phn is not good enough the battery backup is only to hours when you will playing high graphics game like pubg the front camera is good but the back camera clicks descent photo not good as realme pro the phone gets also some heat when you will playing games gaming performence is good in this price range rest of all features is good display unlock sensor speaker audio output all are best at this price gb variant is totally value for money which comes in
3462,2.0,the screen visibility is poor in outdoorthe network proximity sensor wifi connectivity are poor battery is very poor system consumes gb for apps and no external storage is a major drawback the service from amazon is not good
3463,4.0,battery camera face id and everything works well slightly heavy and bigger if you are not used to use large screen phones but use will soon get used to it
3464,4.0,this is one of the finest devices for travel battery lasts long easy to charge and built quality is amazing prices are competitive as well i gifted this to some of my colleagues and they were thrilled update after using it on a few trips really worth it and couldnt have asked for more so easy to pair and the battery backup is wonderful good sound for such a tiny speaker and more than enough for a room or outdoor camping spots overall very happy
3465,3.0,xiaomi has completely messed up the redmi series with mediatek chipsets i am a big fan of xiaomi and used to recommend xiaomi phones for all right from redmi note times but xiaomi isnt good these days mediatek chipset seems better only on paper in real world performance even yr old redmi a can easily beat it though rear camera quality has improved selfie camera performance is disappointing battery life is no way close to the redmi a or a and the ram managementreal world performance feels completely worst worst xiaomi phone ever now the under k market is filled with better devices like powerful realme c feature rich lenovo a and snappy asus max lite so be wise to choose a good phoneeven redmi a is far better choice than this wish things get improved with miui updates
3466,4.0,i wish i had sized up on this one you cant tell from the photo but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back the back is extremely flatteringly but the front not so much the shorter sides are a little awkward there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan and it lays kind of strange the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile very soft of course i got the blue teal color i found the color to be true to the color online
3467,1.0,duplicate product i recd
3468,3.0,every thing is good but mp camera as compared to oppo vivo apple is not good need to work on this
3469,1.0,refund
3470,4.0,i really really like this tunic it is gorgeous but it runs small i tried in l usually wear lxl i may need to try the xl but i sent it back because it just too expensive the fabric itself is thick and heavy i didnt like the fabric much i wish it were softer especially for such a gorgeous tunic it was hard to send it back but i may try the larger size in the store i think i need sizes up it runs too small
3471,1.0,display gone in days worst product by samsung my trust on samsung and amazon also gone
3472,3.0,loved the look of this shirt on the hanger however when on i found that it puffed out in the back its fitted through the shoulders and midback but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump maybe it wouldnt on someone taller also although this wasnt a con for me the shirt is darker than appears online
3473,2.0,i wanted to love this top but it unfortunately did not work for me the material has a nice weight and feel to it and while i love the pattern the shape leaves something to be desired the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top for reference i am lbs and typically a size i wear a small in retailer clothes and got a small in this top i think an xs would have been to
3474,2.0,i hate to say this but this was terrible on my hair this made my hair rough dry strawlike and completely unmanageable albeit heavenlysmelling even though i used the conditioner religiously i wanted so much to like this product but it seemed to actively damage my otherwise healthy hair i cant use this anymore
3475,5.0,the fabric and cut of the dress is beautiful i am writing a review so i can share my experience regarding size i ordered the dress in size my normal size for this designer it fit ok but was a little large in the bust area for reference i am a a i i returned it and ordered a size which fits perfectly
3476,4.0,i love this dress for day and night time the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra it runs big though im normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me it was also generally too big all over i like the length and the weight of the fabric i purchased in the off black color
3477,2.0,this is the first organix product ive ever bought ive seen the line before and read reviews on their other products but nothing really jumped out to me as a quotmust tryquot while grocery shopping a few weeks ago i spotted the hydrating moroccan argan dry body oil which is evidently a new product on the shelf and picked it up because im super lazy and hate putting lotion for the past year or so ive been using neutrogenas sesame oil which i really love but unfortunately ive only been able to find the regular scented version which i really really dont like first the good points this oil is fairly moisturizing and has a decent smell im not scent sensitive but i could see how someone who is might find the smell slightly overpowering i wouldnt say the smell is yummy or anything one would want to douse themselves in to me this smells a little plasticy weird i know and slightly tropical in a fake theytotallyaddedscenttothis way the scent is infinitely better than the old lady floral scent the neutrogena folks use for their oil however as for moisturizing this does a fair job per the directions this can be rinsed off after you apply it in the shower or you can smooth it on after your shower while still damp and pat dry for quotextra moisturizingquot i use the latter method and it does keep my dry skin somewhat in check i still have to apply lotion to my elbows dry city hands and feet so its not a catch all since this is a dry oil youre not going to look like an oil slick even if you apply too much it sinks it rather quickly so if youre looking for something that you can apply and not be forced to wait for it to soak in this is your oil i believe i paid around for a ounce bottle which is about as much as a good drugstore lotion so the price is alright i also havent had an adverse reaction to anything in this no weird bouts of body acne or anything like that but since the skin on my body is basically bulletproof im not the best gauge for sensitivity now the bad points this isnt as moisturizing as neutrogenas sesame oil or even plain old baby oil by a long shot with neutrogena my skin is still soft the next day with organix not so much i think the main reason for that is this quotmoroccan argan oilquot is mainly compromised of good old fashioned mineral oil my biggest problem with this oil however is the bottle when i first picked this up in the store the top popped off without me squeezing it the top itself is one of those weird designs that is slightly slanted and just pops off instead of screwing on to me this is the worst design for a bottle of liquid let alone an oil that youre suppose to use in a wet environment i figured i picked up a bum bottle so i chose one that was at the back of the shelf after i got it home i noticed that it was leaking in the bag as soon as i took it out of the bag the top popped off again i managed to keep the top on for a while and used it with relatively few problems the top popped off twice when i used it but i caught it both times but earlier this evening i accidentally knocked the bottle over and about half the oil poured down the drain perhaps the store i went to got a defective batch but if goofy pop off tops are the norm ill use something else im still undecided if ill repurchase this because im a bit irritated by the bottle design and losing half the product down the drain its a decent enough product that is moderately priced but i dont know anyone who doesnt mind spending for something in a shoddy bottle i think ill use up whats left of the bottle and go back to neutrogena even though its a little more expensive edit to add i finally found a bottle of the neutrogena unscented oil that i love so much i stopped using this organix nonsense because it wasnt as moisturizing and i found i still had to apply lotion to my hands knees feet and elbows
3478,2.0,i got a very bad product from apple this was really not expected from apple i dont know whether its an issue from apple or amazon from the day it has come it started giving me issuesissues related hardware like distorted sound ie other person cannot listen the voice clearly voice becomes like mute and software issues like phone getting hanged never heard ios hanging not able to unlock the phone moreover not able to recieve a call i am the first time user to the iphone and got this sort of bad experience which was never thought of or never expectedi am really disappointed with the productalso i think battery life can be improved camera quality and face reader is ok
3479,5.0,i wasnt sure how the knotted front would look on me but it lays perfectly very comfortable welldesigned flattering top in lovely rich colors im normally a smallmedium in retailer tops but i got the large as it does run small and i dont like things too clingy so best to try on in store rather than buy online nice simple statement piece
3480,2.0,phone is hanging even some times to play a small vedio also irritates u really didnt expect this from mi
3481,5.0,this is a go with everything throw on sweater coat that is very soft and flattering on the fit is true to size for a swing coat being a heather black helps with the no show of lint i will wear this no doubt for years to come thanks retailer
3482,1.0,loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding unfortunately the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else it fit well but was poorly made based off other reviews this isnt the first time this has happened with this dress not worth the risk at all
3483,2.0,sound not clear poor voice clarity and when u put earplugs u feel uncomfort u cannot stay with more then minutes u feel its irritatingbass is there but like local quality base headphonez
3484,3.0,some times touch is not working and also phone hang problem
3485,3.0,i got this after using the moroccan argan oil and the coconut serum i got great results with both the smell is absolutely amazing my hair is oily in the roots but dry at the ends and the shampoo just made this worse after the first couple of days my hair turned into a mess my roots were so oily i had to wash them twice a day and i even had to trim the ends because they were so dry also i got this annoying itch i definitely wont buy again
3486,5.0,good quality casual feel good dress it can be worn as dress or as tunic over the pants

3490,5.0,this shirt fits beautifully though might be tight for the large chested the fabrics is very soft and the look classic and feminine
3491,5.0,camera problems
3492,1.0,this is the most awfully built phone i have ever purchased ever within days of receiving the phone i realised that the phone had bent saw the bend today while i was putting it on charge as seen in the photographs there is no damage to the screen but look at the side panels theyre bent how how is it that a phone is so awfully built noticed this just two days after the cooling off period
3493,2.0,sound quality low speaker volume quite lowreally hate it
3494,3.0,while i typically love the organix line the results of this hair treatment were pretty underwhelming it smells absolutely fantastic a refreshing aquatic spalike scent but it basically just felt like a normal conditioner i appreciate that its a lightweight treatment that didnt weigh my hair down or make it look greasy and my hair did seem a little less frizzyunmanageable after i used it but it just doesnt have much of a richluxuriousmoisturizing texture it definitely didnt do my hair any harm and the price was so reasonable that i dont regret buying it i think it was on sale for at albertsons but its literally a bit lackluster
3495,5.0,i bought this in the mauve in my usual size small i think this sweater is intentionally big and slouchy so i would say it runs true to size it is very soft and the weave is airynot going to be warm enough for a below freezing day but i love the style the neckline is a bit fussy but i think you just have to wear it and let it fall the way it wants to the sleeves are long enough to cover your hands the sweater when pulled all the way down covers my butt and half my thighs and im t
3496,4.0,i love these cords soft and great fit bought three colors
3497,4.0,fingerprint reader is bit slow camera quality is awesome battery life is very good i charged the battery yesterday am then till pm used the phone continuous using camera for video recording and pictures in the evening i watched youtube videos for long time till today morning by am the battery life was remaining after all the internet surfing calling chatting and all screen shot facility is not provided in lock button or in the quick function i have to press volume button with lock key screen display is the best voices are very clear is calling speaker is very louder at full volume overall nice product
3498,4.0,the product works as expected and loving it although amazon failed to place an installation request although they claimed to have done it i had to call the whirlpool customer care and they did the installation the same day
3499,3.0,i was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful breezy dress for summer unfortunately i didnt find the fit to be very flattering as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline upper arms and shoulders the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i
3500,4.0,good product at right price
3501,5.0,the sounds gets distorted at times and so does the picture quality i guess the picture is due to to wifi signal however i am unable to understand the sound quality issue yet even the streaming does not happen of there is little wifi signal strength whereas the same can be watched over the smartphone
3502,5.0,want to buy another

3505,5.0,fingerprint and face recognition works really fast camera pland battery is really amazing pros mp camera mah battery samoled display light weight even after such huge battery cons only which is less color option to choose overall its a best budget phone who are looking for good camera with good battery
3506,2.0,average productafter one month speaker is damagedone should buy another better brand at this price
3507,3.0,purchased with good expectations as this is highlighted with mah battery but infact this is giving hardly hours back up only which already i had with my another phone which is mah battery camera is also not upto a great level of capturing and as usual with samsung slight heating problem is feeling design is good but performance is just average and not an advisable one to purchase call volume is also seemingly lower but it might be a design good up of speaker position
3508,5.0,i love this top shows off the shoulders but a normal bra works no tank needed not too boxy looking all these things i have had a problem in some of the currant tops an retailer i felt it was flattering and comfortable with some country chic i found the colors to be a bit more rich than online there was a tiny bit of puffy fabric around the back upper shoulder but nothing to worry about the neckline is a stretchy and close fitting and thats the part of the top that i dont usually wear i
3509,3.0,battery life is not good camera is ok speakers got issue on my phone
3510,2.0,i got this on sale for a few dollars off of the regular price i purchased this on the same day i got the organix macadamia oil conditioner and shampoo both of which my hair loves very much i have very curly hair so i wanted to try this cream to see if it helped combat frizz and define my curls i have used this a few different times and i am not impressed at all it doesnt do much for my hair it doesnt define curls or keep them together the only plus and the reason i gave it stars is the smell it smells really nice and reminds me of the original pantene shampooconditioner however there are better curling creams out there
3511,1.0,sensors and hardware of this phone is not good please prefer other phone i have purchased it from amazon on oct it was working wall for almost months then this phone started giving me problems like my volume keeps incresing even if i press volume low key sometimes device hang out also camera quality was not as good as described here also battery is not good enough wont go for mi or asus ever again in my life its your money think before you invest

3547,2.0,unfortunately this sd card is not fully compatible with the samsung galaxy s i installed it and the phone would check it only to tell me sd card ready for removal this was a continuous cycle and even after formatting to fat ntfs and fat the card would not work and would revert back to exfat formati do recommend this product for those who can get it to work but my stars rating is only due to a lack of compatibility listing on the product site
3548,3.0,this thing smells really good it definitely makes hair feel smoother and for the price its awesome it makes a difference in my hair for the day but its never lasting like some highend stuff id rather spend money on a pricier item that works my hair more would recommend if you are in need of a cheap hair treatment but wouldnt repurchase

3563,3.0,i was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on its a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe its because i ordered a large im lbs d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress
3564,3.0,i purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but its thin and see through if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it

3574,5.0,they are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort
3575,5.0,if you love the boho style then this too is for you it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans leggings sandals boots and booties i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws for reference im and bought the pm but needed the ps i have recievied tons of compliments and im thinking of getting the silver one too

3581,1.0,phone not working
3582,5.0,mobile looking good performing good totally satisfied display clarity sound clarity superb for normal usage battery comes one and half day
3583,4.0,samsung galaxy m one of the best smartphone in this range and competitor to high end phones too massive battery and almost two days of battery life is really impressive tripple rear camera is really impressive which gives shots with great depth and picture quality and colour perception front selfie camera is also best in this range now coming to the screen inch tear drop notch is really impressive full hd display gives good quality videos movies experience build quality is also good with dual shade colour overall best phone under k range

3588,4.0,best in all class but android one so bettryy life low over all best
3589,5.0,i ordered size small i am b the fabric is super soft and the fit is great theres an adorable little quote on the panties lining and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining the feel of the lace and fabric is divine love it one more thing to notethere is very little lining in the bra really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric it is enough to protect modesty but not much else
3590,3.0,i ordered a size my usual size is a or the tunic fit well through the torso but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long i dont want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy
3591,5.0,endless fun something new everyday would and probably will buy again bought them as gifts and everyone loved them
3592,2.0,the first drawback about the phone isit dont have separate audio jack u have to use the connecter provided to connect to the usb ieu cant use ur earphones while charging the second drawback of the phone is its battery life when using mobile data its getting drained at avery faster rate

3599,1.0,i wish i could give amazon o stars no wonder mac is awesome product but buying it on heavy discount on amazon made me regret big time this is only second month to my purchase and it started showing up problems when taken to apple centre they say mother board has to be replaced not sure if amazon sells defects tie products on heavy discounts i am a frequent and loyal buyer from amazon but i have simply lost trust in them as my almost k product has gone for a troll you are a shame mac has also let me down as they were suppose to provide best in class products now what they have in justification is that it shouldnt happen but we will replace the part coz it is in warranty imagine had it not been in warranty period my hard earned money invested on this effing product would have gone into trash big thumbs down for amazon india and mac who make fools out of customer and not giving them full satisfaction even the executive seated at service centres give least explanation as to how a new product can show such defect useless people
3600,2.0,after using it for weeks and days i have heating problem and the battery backup is very bad some times it dont show the increased battery percentage just stay on
3601,2.0,i wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird slender in arms but baggy in the torso i will be returning
3602,5.0,id been eyeing this dress for a while wondering if it could work for me i wound up ordering the sp size when it went on sale its pretty perfecti am and currently lbs it fits well if a touch loose in the waist but i think if i had purchased the xsp it might be too snug through the bust as its fairly fitted there the neckline comes a little lower than i usually wear which is part of why i wanted to order the petite size rather than the regular that and the length but i can
3603,5.0,i bought this memory card to replace a gb memory card in a zte valey phoneand it works great
3604,2.0,i wanted to love this shirt but was very disappointed i had read other reviews and still ordered but wish i would have listened the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering had to send it back
3605,3.0,tried this on in store and it runs very small i am a size but have curvy hips so i sized up to a size and i couldnt even button it i was hoping it was more of an aline but its fit more like a pencil skirt not very flattering on my body type overall cute design but not for me
3606,4.0,product is as per expectations and amazon had some cool offers to add to our happiness quality is very good
3607,3.0,worth the money rest features of camera and call should be improvised
3608,4.0,nice but bit overpriced
3609,3.0,i loved this dress and tried on the xs in the store and then ordered the petite i thought if i ordered the petite it would not be as baggy it is just way to boxybaggy for someone my height and weight however i would recommend to someone taller because the velvet is great quality and it would have been an amazing dress to have for fall and also for winter for reference i am and weight pounds
3610,5.0,worked well after reformatting good thing i was able to download the free app on line after reformatting memory to spare i like being able to download and snap photos without thinking how much space left in the phone
3611,1.0,very poor response of machinehard disk gone in a year time
3612,4.0,i love this sweater and the sleeves are amazing i also love the purple color which is more of a deep maroon the material seems to be of good quality what i dont love about this sweater is the shape it is very swingy which is somewhat flattering because it isnt too clingy but it poofs out a bit too much on the sides becoming unflattering from certain angles
3613,2.0,battary life very disappointed
3614,2.0,battery back is very bad only h m playback
3615,3.0,not up to retailer standards fabric quite thinyou could see nudecolor bra through the white one and thin fabric wide bottom hung sloppy no way i would feel well dressed in this top i returned it
3616,1.0,lot of heating issues if u play song in youtube do system update or install apps from app store then phone gets over heated i called customer support they told me to install blancco app so that they can record the temp of mobile times i called both the times they told me tat there is no heating issue n test is passed but both the times temp was degree according to them degree is not hot they want more than that so this is some kind of scam going on with blancco app so i request customers not to purchase mobile phones from amazon they give defective mobiles like this and play with the customers because of this we can neither return the handset back nor get the replacement also easily like it used to happen earlier if there was an option for giving stars id have definitely given it so from now on ill not buy mobile phones from amazon we trust amazon n buy products here now when we just want to return or replace the product it is taking so much time n difficulties
3617,3.0,amazon is still slow to make this user friendly but its slowly improving most of what it can do is easier to do by just checking your phone i know someone who has invested a lot into upgrading his home to a smart home environment and speaks very highly of echo dots capabilities but for those without smart devices it is just an okay experience pain to set up multiple devices to use as entercom but we finally to it to work and thats a great feature it doesnt work easily with iphone which is very frustrating calendars todo lists music etc good luck
3618,5.0,the print and fit of this dress is perfect its very flattering and slimming

3621,3.0,camera is not good as compare to other
3622,3.0,this is a relatively cute top when you try it on however i dont think it will hold its shape after even just wear it also doesnt seem like you could wash it without ruining it like a shirt form a throwaway cheap clothing store i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high viscose meaning it wont last long at all im returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is
3623,3.0,slowly working
3624,2.0,length too long and waist to high these are not sized for petites
3625,1.0,hanging issue network dropping issue needed restart to get network again face detection is also very disappointed please never waste your money with this product
3626,4.0,if you are on a budget then this will surely be a good product

3632,4.0,value for money i just connected a mouse to this and installed nova launcher now this is like a inch android phone haha overall great product and since this is made in india i would recommend everyone to buy they have toll free service centre lines which is good
3633,3.0,dont buy this go for samsung apple have a great brand value but the customer service is the so worst thing in apple i believe going to samsung is best than apple
3634,3.0,i stalked this blouse and when the price dropped i pounced on the black sadly it did nothing for me im a large sometimes medium but decided on the large youd think it came with its own cami at this price but no completely sheer unwearable without one the lace is nothing special the collar is wider in the back uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front the highlow hem fit me oddly in the back im returning this one
3635,2.0,i couldnt wait to get this dress i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag while the fabric was beautiful the sizing was way off this dress claims to be long and i could tell instantly it wasnt it barely covered my rear i also know its supposed to be flowy but it was really really wide i can see this working for someone around feet tall who is wider
3636,3.0,i dont know much about phone but its okay type for the price the camera is not so good and battery doesnot last long i dont know this is a good product or not but i dont actually regret it for the price
3637,2.0,i am felling cheated on battery mi should back back this phone on full prices top class phone but worst battery backup
3638,3.0,i liked this top i really did i also liked the subtle shimmer the fabric didnt seem as soft but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back you can see it on the model here but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didnt look right asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large but here it is the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader i am sending it back
3639,5.0,its a nice phone in budget has a good camera screen is quite good
3640,3.0,it is good phone with awesome specifications but sometimes the phone has bugs here and there might be software issue may be it will get solved through updates and pubg mobile game works smoothly but makes phone lag often dont know why otherwise its a good phone at this price and is value for money the camera is the best thing of this phone and the pure android feels good and got the android pie update yesterday only i will update the review soon its better than realme pro nd asus max pro becoz of its over clocked processor

3650,4.0,battery performance do not match mah as specified camera night performance can still be improved but camera day light performance is awesome the screen touch sensitivity is too good
3651,3.0,this top is good quality and cute it runs large im usually a medium and needed a small the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on it makes me look wide in the waist or like im wearing a maternity top unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it
3652,4.0,picture quality is good and so is the battery lifemanual mode in camera is really good the phone response is one big con of this handsetit lags sometimes but never hangs overall a descent buy

3678,2.0,over all future is ok but display resolution is poor and finger print sensor reeds finger prints very slowly it takes more than seconds and phone weight is little more to compare with other mobile
3679,2.0,i was surprised by the other reviews expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward the hilow cut with so much bulk just wasnt flattering i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as id hoped it went back
3680,1.0,hot hot hot garbage nonfunctional and a total waste cant hold a connection complete a sentence or function at all
3681,3.0,sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured no ruffle such a bummer sleeves are much longer and yes its teared in the front and back also the button opening on the back is much longerlarger in my opinion ill most likely keep it but consider the mentioned if buying
3682,3.0,i really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesnt seem to be a womans white t on the planet that isnt these days however it was really sheer the fit was also short and boxy this coming from a woman who is shortwaisted on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute maybe if you are younger and dont mind the sheerness its worth the gambl

3688,3.0,im on the search for a new shampoo and conditioner combo that prevents breakage as i have flyaways like you wouldnt believe mostly caused by brushing my long straight hair too much with the wrong brush but possibly also due to using harsh shampoos i figured i might as well review the different products im trying out since this site is informing my choices this one felt good in the shower but i actually had more frizz and flyaways the next day i cant tell whether or not it can prevent breakage but im not a fan of the look it gives me ill finish using it on days when i dont care how my hair looks but likely wont repurchase will edit if i change my mind about how it works
3689,1.0,bad power bank i want a power bank for my moto g plus fast charging and in discription its mentioned also its support fast charging but feel soo embarassing its not support fast charging bad tooo bad
3690,4.0,this velvet tshirt is perfect for the holidays i usually wear a size top or a l but i ordered up and got a size xl it is very tight around my chest c and armpits and the vneck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot but other than that it looks great just runs small if you are a size or larger i dont think that this will fit
3691,3.0,i wanted to love this turtleneck i read the reviews before ordering i love the color the weight of the knit the ribbing the small fit me perfectly i am a b not broad shouldered and on the thin side in my upper body however this item has a strange blousy fit the picture of the back view hints at this but its worse in person its like a bell shaped top or even slightly trapezey which simply doesnt work with my shape plus im long waisted i could have made this work had it not
3692,2.0,battery quality very poor
3693,5.0,reliable phone on this price with years warranty

3695,5.0,cool product once again brings lifestyle changes easy to use lacks portability
3696,1.0,i think it is a refurbished one for the past couple of months the performance has been so poor and for the past days the speaker is not working i am really worried if i can get it replaced or repaired
3697,4.0,i tried this top in both colors for the black the lining looks much more peach in person the main issue though is the diagonal line that runs through the middle of the top you can see it in the picture but is much more pronounced in person it appears to be where pieces of lace are sewed together and it just looks sloppy the line is much less obvious in the navy and looks much more seamless perhaps because there is a transition between two colors of lace the black lining is completel
3698,2.0,this looked like such a cute casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said it runs small im usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips however once on i couldnt figure out how id wear this i wouldnt pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didnt seem like a good idea either between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
3699,1.0,bad experience
3700,2.0,im petite and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater that is the look that is portrayed on the model the sweater is scratchy the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right it looks great on the model here but not on me going back so bummed the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little holes or openings across the shoulders so there is a tiny bit of detail overall not a great sweater
3701,2.0,no proper power back mobile is getting switched off frequently by morning no extra options to set the notification tones not at all satisfied with the mobile
3702,1.0,dont buy this note pro u r getting front camera with mp only whereas note pro has dual dear front camera with mp purchase the better note pro from flipkard if possible this note pro is totally different and waste of money you will regret after buying it you cant return this product you only can replace it dont buy smartphones from amazon
3703,1.0,normally hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses this dress is a big thumbs down as most of these reviewers and myself point out the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you dont just get a peak of your bra you get to see the whole side of it secondly the bust of the dress would work only for an acup bra too small for the average woman the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself excelle

3715,2.0,these could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of

3717,3.0,this dress is not what i expected the bottom half is woollike materiallooks like someone has worn it the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms i wouldnt of paid full price but for the amount i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter
3718,3.0,this dress has very pretty colors on the embroidery there is nothing wrong with the dress other than the fact that there is nothing special about it very blah fit the fabric feels very polyester no real shape to it the embroidery on the dress i tried was lined up like the photo so no problems there just nothing about the dress made me want to wear it perhaps at a much lower price point but at this price point its disappointing size fit perfectly and i am in general just

3723,1.0,wrost phpne ever automatic on and off even full charge very very very bad experience no invoice with phone
3724,4.0,mi brand is now a worthy competitor to put your money on quality of the product is good need to charge as its blinking two led lights

3726,4.0,i got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtimepretty but with a fair amount of coverage i am really happy with them wonderful with a tank top or chemise i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans but i love them for sleeping they feel special

3733,5.0,better than mi and honor best decision ever made performance is the fabulous pubg work daam good
3734,2.0,i was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms its clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure and athletic i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu
3735,2.0,i couldnt wait to try this on this sweater sadly it was too large in all ways the sleeves are adorable but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms this was much longer on me than the model it stopped midthigh the quality seemed fine but it is a thin sweater
3736,5.0,nice picture and sound quality
3737,1.0,first the supplier cheated me by sending a cheap third rate product that i would not give my house help the exchange was better but shocked at the sound quality of jbl which is perceived as a leading brand
3738,2.0,very bad camera quality even old keypad phone camera quality is better then its
3739,4.0,this is a great product but with over production comes some small issues at times my phone will say that my card is damaged sometimes so i have to reboot not sure if its the phone or the card i got of these one for me and the wife hers never have any issues i can live with it it happens every so often
3740,3.0,i love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on but within a day of wear i noticed significant pilling which made it appear much older worn
3741,2.0,this would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy too bad
3742,1.0,very worst product i hate it please take it and refund me
3743,3.0,im using this in a samsung galaxy s gb unlocked smartphone and the only problem is as you write more and more flies to the card it gets slower and slower to the point that youll be so po at a crucial moment say for example you want to access a video or doc that when you do actually get your file youve lost all faith in the card so buy it for the capacity but always remember its not reliable for fast access
3744,2.0,book was good but the packaging was bad
3745,1.0,raddi phone hai
3746,5.0,the sleeves are fitted which i love works with a belt or without
3747,4.0,hmm
3748,1.0,moved from andriod to ios very disappointed on the flexibility of use compared to andriod very rigid set of controls not much options to play around like andrioid apps moreover you cannot move whatsapp and truecaller data to ios you have to loose all that data truecaller doesnt show caller id photos are native format and need a rd party utility to convert to jpg apple google keyboard doesnt show any alpha numeric layout you have to switch layout no autosave passwords for websites you visit in chrome i think due to battery very heavy pretty unimpressive and not happy last but not the least no amazon upi on ios very funny and silly phone that is sold by amazon itself thats amazing apple the worlds costliest least worthy phone sold by amazon
3749,3.0,slouchy relaxed fit well sewn together and hangs well on the body bottom hem hits upper thigh good length and soft easy fabric light layering option as well good spring jacket can be kept on indoors without getting too hot
3750,3.0,cute skort but seems to run big its also sort of long for shorts the model must have much longer legs than me i may try a size smaller since i love the print but im not optimistic
3751,4.0,this is really the best iphone ever im in love
3752,1.0,my phone is producing too much heat even didnt put sim never used more than half an hour and its producing too much heat totally disappointed with amazon now they are saying to go icare services after calling to customer care several times amazon cant do anything for this worst experience with amazon no one would like to repair new phone better go for shop to buy apple products
3753,4.0,product is good but search engine and data base needs update lot of things she cannot search which is easily available in google
3754,1.0,received a pirated copy
3755,3.0,the only best thing i liked was the monster battery it lives upto expectations face unlock is not working from nd day and cant register also not sure about the problem finger print unlock is bit slow sometimes camera quality is not what we expected its surprising how come mp doesnt produce sharp images and my opt was much better with less specs
3756,3.0,i loved the brown color on the model and i love the wrap style in general however im not sure if the color looks as goon on me i first ordered my standard size small lbs b which fit but exchanged it for the looser fit medium shown in the pictures i really like that the material is a thin but not see through cotton it has an extra cotton layer lining in front which is nice the v isnt too low on me so i dont have to wear a cami under not really crazy about the s
3757,5.0,great sweater vest its not too thin or too thick just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition its easy to put on and i dont worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler highly recommend i am a b and usually wear a
3758,4.0,we like it not the greatest sound quality but its adequate and can be easily upgraded with an external speaker we gave it stars because nothings perfect but the dot is pretty close
3759,3.0,there is so much that she doesnt know
3760,5.0,well sound quality is excellent with price range voice command while opening and mode change are predicted
3761,3.0,this suit is so adorable i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me the suit is comfy seems well made and fit nicely but although it fit technically i dont like the way it cuts me off at the thigh its not flattering for me at all the suit is kind of a neoprene material so its thicker than a normal bathing suit so i think even though it isnt lined it might not be seethrough but i didnt get it wet to test it out in terms of fit i think it
3762,5.0,its hard to go wrong with the charlies especially in this fabric keep them coming i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well they fit pretty true to size id say try both your usual size and one size down as well they stretch out a little so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric try wearing a burnt orange green or pink the isabella sinclair grid wrap but
3763,1.0,the australian market versions of ogx are like washing your hair in in dish detergent the conditioners are just as bad
3764,3.0,i was given this conditioner by a fellow finehaired lass for whom it didnt work she warned me it might weigh my hair down as it had hers but i decided to try it anyway well it did weigh my hair down but i love the scent it reminds me of aquolina pink sugar which i wore years ago and so made it work by using it for reversewashing and rotating it with other products i finished my mostly full bottle organix should either reformulate this to make it work for fine hair or market it for hardier hair types but definitely keep the delicious scent did i mention that it lingers for a couple days i dig it but you might not i didnt buy this but organix products are on the pricey side for drugstore hair products a bottle though theyre often on sale still i may get it again just for the scent
3765,2.0,didnt know a lot
3766,1.0,bought october th passed away december rd ripi didnt really even use it because of the built in storage on my gs i had about gb of music and movies on it but only for when i was unexpectedly bored and without my zunehd on to the next brand i guess
3767,4.0,works fine but it is becoming very annoying that even with flash devices you buy gb but only get gb why not just label it as the exact size
3768,4.0,i like this phone very well but battery should me more than mah this devise is mah battery this is not enough fir gaming and many more activities but i like this device mote than other
3769,5.0,nice battery works good in travelling
3770,5.0,me waist hips tried the size the usual for me in pilcro they fit like a glove and i loved them i clearly needed a heel to do them justice and now i see the photos of my rear im a bit doubtful but pilcros always stretch a little and these are super soft and funky a win
3771,5.0,mast mobile
3772,4.0,this and my big echo doesnt seem to know as much as one would hope or at least as much as was advertised it is good for weather and playing musicreally good but its knowledge base for other things seems its limited overall however a neat little device i put one in my office and i love it
3773,1.0,i was really excited about this sweater but the fit was terrible the sleeves were the right size but the body of the sweater was a tent absolutely no shape they must have clipped the sweater on the model for reference im and pounds and ordered a size small
3774,4.0,good product at this segment main issue speaker volume low compared with mi a
3775,5.0,ultimate bettery ultimate phone
3776,4.0,nice mobile worth of money
3777,3.0,i followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe i am usually a size but ordered a ok maybe overkill i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight but this was way too big and tent like i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size stay tuned for an update
3778,5.0,received ms days back i will describe you my experience in these days the first impression is just amazing its smooth fast and you cant come out of it the display is stunning and camera is amazing battery backup is also too good and it took me min to charge from to pros camera battery display performance speed gaming experience cons no headset back camera is not too good overall
3779,3.0,the phone is very nice and the build quality is also good and it has a nice display and a good speaker in this price range in performance wise the phone is good for normal users like surfing and it is good for casual gaming but comes to heavy games like pubg etc the phone sucks the phone is not good for gaming it really sucks go for real me c adding buck dont buy it for the users who do heavy games in their phone but the other wise for common users it is a good phone no lags in surfing in internet etc it is really a good choice for common people but if you are gamer dont buy it really sucks go for real me c its will give u decent performance in this price range
3780,4.0,love the echo dot i would give it stars but sometimes she will start talking out of nowhere
3781,4.0,after four months of usage it is a very decent product ive bought the gb gb ram version touch sensors processing battery life everythings great photos are quite good too to my surprise only minus is the loud speaker could be a bit better and my current phillip earphones are not supported by pro had to order mi earphones
3782,4.0,i would have liked it but it was too small for me
3783,5.0,its very good phone to buy camera quality is ultimate its performance is awesome design is good black doesnt look boring anymore
3784,5.0,nice productworth to buy
3785,4.0,the fabric is so thin i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normalsized letter envelope the problem is not going to be that the garment is seethrough which it is its the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky its cottoney and i suspect it will get stuck against the back of my shirtpants while im wearing it and not drape nicely i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly however im such a sucker for a pre
3786,3.0,i still have mixed feelings about this pants the fabric is nice soft and flows well the fit is good i ordered could have gone with not a big deal the one thing that is off is the length i am and these come right to above my anklenowhere close to how they sit on the model the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there too short for regular pant length and too long for crops i will probably have to hem them a bit which is a disappointment when you pay so muc
3787,3.0,i ordered this in size xl and it ran small im a pearshape and thought this style would be flattering i have a few other peplumstyle sweatshirts from retailer that are my favorites but the cut on this is tighter so the bottom layers gap and dont flow well i found it to run short too its cut one size too small i would have sized up but being xl theres no option for that im returning mine the applique is done well and is cute the colors look the same in person
3788,5.0,good package and build quality
3789,3.0,these are great for summer except you need to size down unless the pair i received was an anomaly these run very large
3790,4.0,this is a lovely dress the shape is really flattering and its light and easy to wear the only problem i have is it runs a little big im normally a and im sizing down to a otherwise its pretty perfect the length is good for taller women im and the bodice is sturdy enough that smaller cup sizes wont need a bra definitely recommend this
3791,1.0,its old product
3792,5.0,i tried on the usual xs in the patterned style and it fit really nicely the colors are very nice in person vibrant teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing the sleeves flutter out and will give a bit more volume if i would change something that would be it i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter i am lbs for reference
3793,2.0,frequently gets hang speaker is too bad
3794,5.0,the best thing to have in your home i love it
3795,3.0,this dress has a beautiful color and design however it runs too big im usually between size or on antropologies cloths i had to size down to size to get a more fitted look like the model
3796,5.0,a must for every closet very flattering fit although i think the white is slightly boxier than the chambray
3797,4.0,got this withing two day one of the thing which i liked about this band is its display its good another thing are its step counter it will give you good accurate reading steps sleep tracking is spot on even it will track nap heart rate dont know about it i havent compared it with medical grade equipment spo and music control feature will be activated after update so update it as you get it only cons is its life is on lower end but compare to feature accuracy and display you will be happy buy my one advice is that buy this only if it is going to be helpfull to you other wise no need to buy it and there are some not so serious health issues have been found in other countries product fitbit so please buy only if you need good product by huawei
3798,5.0,i just tried these on at my local seattle store and ended buying a size up i feel they ran small as i am usually a in most and got the in these the fit tight but it looked nothing special just like a very high rise mom jean and i was bursting the top button so this jean is made for hourglass bodies for sure the is loose and slouchy and it looked really different in a good way so it came home with me they are a washed out black grey color with some tie die effects did not care fo
3799,4.0,i went to the store specifically to try this dress on because i was captivated by the photos online but worried about the fit it was just as pretty or even prettier in real life but unfortunately i couldnt fill out the top there was gaping even when i went down to a size even though i mostly wear a and sometimes a in retailer dresses the fit me everywhere else which is why im saying this dress runs small would it have worked with a padded bra or for someone with more cup size
3800,3.0,good phn but having too many drawbacks battery life is not for heavy users
3801,4.0,spacious faster cooling
3802,3.0,hey everyone who so ever are making the plan of buying please dont buy because they are giving very poor quality mobile phone and the camera quality is really bad and phone is hanging too much so i would prefer that no one should buy this and you can view the the vivo and oppo because these both company are giving very good quality service and good quality mobile phone to the customers and they are very low in rangers so if you are planning to buy a mobile phone in the low range then the best option is vivo and oppo and i will prefer you to buy the vivo and oppo accept samsung and i already visited samsung service centre two times but they didnt give me that much kind of service by which i felt satisfied except battery there is nothing good in this mobile phone and i have one vivo v which is very good in every situation and in every condition and i am using vivo from last years and i never felt bad and any kind of problem in that and if any customer gonna buy this is contact me i will tell you everything about that mobile phone clearly that what is proper mobile they are giving to their customers any query contact number is
3803,4.0,works pretty good going to get more things that work with alexa
3804,3.0,not must to have it
3805,3.0,defective product received kindly exchange it
3806,1.0,died within months stopped being able to read or write when i went to destroy it it crumbled easily into tiny pieces never again
3807,1.0,bought this for my samsung galaxy note ii i started having all kinds of issues with recording photos and movies to the card it would look like it worked and then when id go back to review the photos or movies they were corrupted i see other people having the same issue with these cards lost memories bad card
3808,2.0,i bought this shampoo for two reasons it was sulphatefree the smell i will definitely not be repurchasing this shampoo it did nothing for my hair like right after i wash it makes my hair feel too clean and then like a few hours later less than hrs it feels all greasy its kinda gross i used the coordinating conditioner and that didnt do anything either this is one of the worst shampoos i have ever used
3809,3.0,sound is good but stopped working just in months
3810,3.0,its a cool little gadget but doesnt know much its going to take some time before the ai is developed enough to serve as a virtual assistant
3811,5.0,i bought this for use with my gopro hero silver and i have had no complaints trhgtr thth h r
3812,1.0,very slowhas only hard disc partitionseems heavy dont buy it guysi get rebuked every time my sister uses it
3813,4.0,the shirt fits nice and has a classic cut i would imagine this to look good on just about anyone the shirt is soft and comfortable but is rather thin and see through the stitching is coming undone a little bit in some areas wouldnt pay full price for it but its worth it on sale
3814,3.0,i wanted to love this so much i am and normally do a size large in retailer but based on the previous review i sized down the top fit fine but the bottom just sort of poofed out not flattering it does have pockets which are amazing but overall just wasnt a good fit the top is tshirt material not denim
3815,1.0,i have mediumthick wavy hair and can usually skip washing every days not with this i had to wash every day because this left an oily residue on my roots im constantly trying new conditioners and have never had this problem not even with other organix ones ive recently switched to a beekind conditioner sample from my birchbox and the problem went away also the smell is really overpowering and too sweet for me
3816,4.0,such a cute top can be dressed up or down i wore it on sting break and had many compliments
3817,5.0,it has just been days and phone has got problem it has been swiched off suddenly while the phone was charged and its not getting on
3818,4.0,i am and wear between a pant and ml tops depending i would consider myself a pear bodytype bc i have a thicker midsection and flat everywhere else for this i ordered a medium and it was slightly loose so if you are conscious about your midsection ordering your normal size will probably be fine the fabric is very lightweight like a normal drapey tshirt would be made out of just to keep in mind the draping is really cool though i would just probably handwash dryclean or if
3819,1.0,wont play music siruisxm or pandora or just about anything its hooked up correctly i have other echo devices and they work fine ive restarted it and i set it up a nd time garbage
3820,4.0,loved this at first but not as helpful as siri she does play games though and plays most music a fun entertainment piece for the famliy great to ask about hte weather
3821,5.0,got it for k worth it
3822,4.0,this t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything my only concern is the fabric is super light not enough to be see through but just enough to make me question the quality i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though the drape is nice and not super revealing discreet enough for work i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile
3823,3.0,this is an easygoing weekend piece it wrinkles a bit easily but its comfy and swingy i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern nude bra or nude cami im still not sure if its appropriate to wear without a cami
3824,2.0,i bought it for a samsung s and had continuous problems of messages saying it wasnt connected etc replaced it wit the equivalent trascend and never had a problem for the past several months it would work on a pc with ana adapater and then failed to format in any device so i had to rma given the lifetime guarantee a hassle
3825,3.0,this jacket runs very large i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium i have long arms and the sleeves were way past my hands i love the jacket but its just too sloppy
3826,4.0,processor is very good but camera can be improved
3827,3.0,no in built call recorder cant install xiaomi call recorder inbuilt redmi not
3828,5.0,skirt fits true to size i bought a regular size even though im only feet because i didnt want it too short the size was perfect as it hit right above the knee bold vibrant color and great quality also very unique which is what i look for at ahtro recommend give it a shot
3829,2.0,this product without amazon prime is useless also i speak spanish and spanish support is highly requested for years and still nothing
3830,1.0,the camera is very worst in number they have mentioned mp but its like mp only waste of money do not buy
3831,2.0,i have the echo and three dots the music everywhere does not work sometimes they will play two or three songs and quit i am loosing faith in amazon
3832,3.0,i have the big one and never have problems with it the dot well every time my alarm goes off i tell alexa to stop and she keeps going even thou the dot is my bedroom next to my bed then i tell the dot hows the weather and at times the light comes on and she ignores me i will not buy another dot ever again i even made a complain with customer service and i never got anything back from them
3833,5.0,quality is nice and book is very helpful and informative
3834,5.0,i loved the look of this dress the moment i saw it but was ridiculously long at i can usually get away with buying regular length longer dresses and pants with the help of heels if needed but not a chance this time this dress does not come in petite and the fringed bottom design of the dress would not allow for any type of altering either
3835,3.0,but the home delivery was very late but the quality of product was fabulous
3836,3.0,i am ever in search of a light white summer top this is not quite it there are two distinct layers and each of them is the scratchy starchy type of gauze it would just roast me in the summer sunbut i run fairly hot in general
3837,2.0,mirror casting not working properly service very poor
3838,3.0,this is a pretty dress although it runs smaller and the colors arent as vibrant as on the website the waist ran very small for me in a size which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure this probably will look very nice on someone smaller
3839,4.0,i love it this is worth it just go for it
3840,2.0,i ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length another customer had a similar review but i still took a chance that it would fit well the sides of the shirt have slits and because the shirt is too short it shows the skin on my hips the rest of the shirt fit fairly well but ill still need to return this top

3849,3.0,i was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail the structure of the top falls funny on your chest a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric it doesnt look right if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric like the main photo shown you are good the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best

3854,2.0,dead display after month
3855,3.0,cost effective
3856,2.0,it seems to me that the organix lines strength is the fragrance of the products rather than the performance silk serum smells great and application is easy enough pump out a bit and evenly distribute it through the length of the hair i get greasy roots so i only applied the serum to the bottom of my hair besides a bit of a film i didnt notice any immmediate change the label claims detangling powers but my comb didnt go through any easier than usual i let my hair dry naturally and the result was well there wasnt much of one my hair looked a little limp was no shinier than usual and felt no softersilkier it did smell lovely though i suppose this will come across as a pretty negative review but really vanilla silk serum was just quotblahquot for me not downright bad i wont buy it again but i wont swear off the whole line either
3857,2.0,i was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering whatwasithinking when you try it on later when i bought this once i tried this on at home i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing theres so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back i wanted to love t

3862,2.0,i was so happy to finally find a scalp treatment that didnt smell like tea tree or mint it wont replace legit dandruff products and the effect is mild but it still helps somewhat i have a dry itchy scalp and spraying this on it per the directions helps to make it feel a bit less itchy and alleviates to a small extent the drynessflaking i do have to wash my hair daily when using this especially in warm andor humid weather it can make my part look greasy and feels just kind of sticky on my scalp the scent is a very subtle fruity one and the product is easy to brush through and doesnt make hair the rest of my hair look greasy update the soothing effect after using for about two weeks become less noticeable i would still feel itchy around the edges of my hairline and my part would look waxy day of oily by the next morning discontinued use

3868,2.0,screen not working after months after buying pls suggest what should i do
3869,1.0,i usually only review things i love but i am making an exception for this serum i cant believe how highly reviewed this is because it was just awful on my hair i have long virgin hair and use serums daily after showering this serum is thick and tacky doesnt absorb and leaves hair greasy i have tried it on my hair dry and wet and either way it is awful it either does nothing or leaves my hair stringy and greasy the renpure moroccan oil serum is the best drugstore serum i have found it actually seems to absorb into the hair leaves it soft and shiny
3870,3.0,really good however i did not find the essential punch
3871,1.0,door shelves breaks only after one month of use i regret in cost cutting the product has non durable and cheap material fibre
3872,5.0,this is really a life changing book the way he wrote about personal legend and dream is way beyond imagination and motivating
3873,3.0,i so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail just felt looked frumpy i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasnt a good fit for my body type i wore my normal size and it just didnt flatter made me feel years older
3874,2.0,im not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange for one thing the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag also the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss
3875,5.0,i love it so far it works as it should the price was good and i am very pleased in fact i bought a gb as well for my phone i bought the gb for my wife

3885,3.0,cute shirt but not worth the price i did purchase it at off but would have waited for a better sale the yellow is a nice fall color
3886,2.0,this is not a gb card it is x gb cards packed together and connected internally if you want to use it as a single gb drive you cannot when i tried to copy the contents of a gb partition it refused to do so saying the space available in the disk was not enough tried to clone the partition and failed again i finally found the truth about the disk on the net so if you want to use this card as a single gb drive do not buy it because it is not a gb card
3887,1.0,this is so close to perfect but theres a seam down the middle of the back and they didnt bother to match the polka dots you can see the mismatch in the second photo i was about to buy the jacket and totally in love when i turned and saw the error i hoped it was one bad match but nope on every one couldnt unsee didnt buy very disappointed

3891,3.0,i wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling im petite build and it consumed my slim figure i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves pinning them back would have been alright but the execution didnt fit my frame i would have liked it to be a tad longer too i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because its so cozy

3907,2.0,the camera quality is disgusting and it doesnt fit the description of mp even when there are no apps running i am getting only gb usable ram when i am asking for a phone replacement for defective piece associates deny it by stating that we dont have any proof for product being defective i am a prime member since a long time and this is how they treat their old customers

3911,4.0,this phone is nice and a pretty much good budget phone it does the basic tasks smoothly but sometimes crunches due to lag overall a decent phone but not for gamers at all
3912,3.0,i love this dress but it is inches shorter than the description says or shows i am only and it is to inches above my knee otherwise it is a loose fit and hides all problem areas
3913,4.0,some times internet using time mobile was heating lite and mobile working condition is good
3914,1.0,this product does not worth for rs waste of money rs correct value for this device we can get better tablets on same cost
3915,3.0,i love this piece because of its flattering stripesi am lbs and ordered a medium the large was just too big the small too short and tight but the medium fit well however the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment and because of this theres an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in how the model has done
3916,2.0,i saw this dress online and i thought it was perfectly cute however once i tried it on at home it just didnt work one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning and once i got it on the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm im and lbs and purchased in size i didnt even try buttoning all the way i took it back and i dont even think i want a larger size the buttons are just too fragile
3917,1.0,oh my god this thing its actually call a conditioner next to what water it smells so good kinda like mint ice cream i accidentally bought two thinking i got the shampoo instead bad mistake for not returning it instead in once use it took half the freaking bottle for it to barely moisturize my curly medium thick oily hairthat says something that it doesnt do anything true it has some nice ingredients but it left my hair really dry damaged and full of knots i had to use a hair mask to counter balance the havoc it caused my poor hair now i have two bottles that i have no use for
3918,2.0,touch feels low quality lagging
3919,2.0,smells clean but isnt clingy and absorbs well with no residuebut my skin was visibly dry within an hour of application this is one of the least moisturizing body lotions i have ever tried its possible i got a bad one but this might be best saved for summer months and people whose skin doesnt need that much hydration

3923,1.0,and this is the nd generation the only questions alexa seems to be able to answer are related to the weather and she seems to get those answers wrong most of the time other than that alexa reverts to her stock response sorry im not sure about that and then theres my personal favorite hmmm i dont know that one so heres another important question alexa definitely wont be able to answer will amazons otherwise stellar reputation be needlessly tarnished by releasing a digital paperweight like the echo want to put your echo to its best and highest use unplug it and use it as the hockey puck it resembles
3924,1.0,this could seriously fit a large and its an xs so frustrating this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous i get the whole loose fit style but seriously youve taken it to a whole new level retailer another trip to the store to return another item a complete waste of my time ugh

3931,4.0,im lb and tried on pxs ps and xs the portions on the petite are perfect for petite sizes however if you are a d cup keep in mind that you cannot wear anything thick underneath it if you go with the fitted size the sleeves are pretty slim in the petite xs too im keeping the pxs skirted trench because it looks like a dress from the fifties fitted and flared and looks so cute unbuttoned like on the model also unlike some trenches there are minimum details like epaulets contra
3932,5.0,i absolutely love this shawljacket i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when its too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket the blackbrown works great with whatever youre wearing so versatile and i love that it has pockets
3933,2.0,i agree with other reviewers it is beautiful but too tight around the chest i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable sadly i had to return it i am lbs and a c by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual

3935,2.0,let me start off by saying that i really really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts got a p unfortunately it didnt work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didnt even bother trying it on the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop

3945,4.0,this cardigan is lovely casual layering piece its a very thin lightweight knit and pairs well with a tee or tank under it i really like the color and the style the longer front can drape or tie for multiple looks
3946,3.0,this dress has a beautiful purple paisley print and reminds me of classic retailer from years ago i wanted to love the dress but it runs extremely large i usually wear a p or xxsp and got this in an xxsp but was still way too big while the intent is to be flowy i was overwhelmed by the bagginess and it changes the style from flowy to baglike while the belt helps cinch the waist i had too much bunching in the waist area making it unattractive very disappointed as its such a pretty
3947,5.0,very nice polkadot pattern i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans it is a timeless classic
3948,5.0,this shirt is awesome i absolutely love the style of this shirt its super flowy and is a really breathable fabric ive been wearing this shirt a lot lately with printed pants the only downside is the quality of material it kind of feels like this shirt could have been made myself with a plain t shirt and some basic sewing skills it also feels like its going to start falling apart at the arm seams nonetheless i adore the shirt and will be getting a lot of use out of it this season no
3949,5.0,i did not get ear phones

3952,2.0,this machine was supposed to come with licensed microsoft office for student but i got expired version of office asking for office product key
3953,1.0,very disappointed ordered two sizes the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldnt have worn it and the zipper was sticking the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under but at they are not returning both sizes
3954,5.0,picture quality is good at this price range sound quality is great
3955,1.0,ill probably never understand what people see in this device i havent been able to discover a single function that my cell phone doesnt handle more reliably and accurately the worst is when a commercial for the echo dot comes on tv and my device perks up and starts responding immediately then theres the creepiness of knowing or sometimes forgetting that theres a device sitting in your house listening to every soundmaybe future versions will be more useful but this one has turned into little more than a paperweight in my household fortunately it didnt cost much
3956,4.0,honar n easy to use and light weight phone
3957,5.0,after monts update is its still awesome
3958,3.0,this product is incredibly comfy and perfect for getting cozy however the sleeves were sort of loose and did not look cohesive with the grey props on the draping though that was lovely
3959,1.0,google services always gets stopped and you are stuck with phone all time worst product to buy online
3960,4.0,i tried this skirt in my usual size s and although it fit it was too short for my liking and made my hips look wide bc of the way it billowed out the size m looked much better hit me right below the knee in the front im my skirt is much more highlow than the picture also it sits much lower on my waist which i like i bought the blue and with the color variations it is gorgeous reminds me of a chambray or denim coloring i rolled it up to take on vacation and it traveled rea
3961,3.0,i order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a petite or xxs petite i ordered this in a petite and it was like inches too small in the rib cage and chest area even if i would have got it zipped up the halter cut is cut narrow so you cant wear a bra for surestrapless would be necessary also the actual neck part was tight for reference i am pounds and a c bust it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs
3962,4.0,got this one at with exchange which makes it a steal deal for me got it delivered within days of ordering the screen looks great samsung has the best displays in the industry and this one is no exception the camera quality is also very good as compared to the competition and the wide angle camera is sweet an a for battery life plus the fast charge bundled in the box also the device is very light the performance is great to but one setback is the design the plastic back spoils the feel a bit as compared to the reamle pro as well as the redmi note launched today if design is not ur priority then a perfect device at this price go for it
3963,3.0,airteljiobsnl sim cards works fine but handset have problem with idea sim
3964,5.0,best mobile under kjust ignore all negative comments its a must buy phone battery back upstar designopal blackstar camerastarcamera quality overall its ok ok type front camera could be better procesor star it has many amazing features like super slow and slow motionalwz on displaydolby atmos and ram management is fantastici am loving it and its a must buy phone in this festive season for availing discounts
3965,5.0,product built quality seems great sound quality is up to mark i didnt felt any connectivity issue overall performance is excellent i dont usually write reviews this is the first time i felt to do i will suggest to purchase this product
3966,5.0,everything superb but battery drain to fast
3967,3.0,i love the style of this top and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts its somewhat fitted on the top yet its aline shape gives a full swing at the bottom the ruffled vneckline is pretty and i like the longer length of the short sleeves but with all these attributes unfortunately they cut the armholes really big so when you put your arms forward the sleeves pull against your arms i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway but for dollars i thin
3968,5.0,super with worthfullbetter clearty good audio
3969,1.0,picture sound quality okay battery life is worst mobile getting struck or hanging and only return back duration given week and experienced very worst support as day return back time so i suggest everyone dont buy from amazon try for other shopping sites
3970,3.0,the fabric is very thin it isnt see through just thin i would have kept this if the full length shell wasnt longer than the dress
3971,2.0,i got this power bank recently after my old one refused to get charged or to charge i read many reviews and thought this was a good product and went ahead with it the delivery was fast so i got to use it within two days of ordering and within days of receiving it i placed a request for return now enough story and more about the pros and cons pros charged my phone pretty clean finish meaning the product looks premium cons heavy and big so cannot really carry it around in hand for long you need a separate bag to lug it around it was not consistent it sometimes charged my phone and sometimes did not stopped charging my apple watch and bluetooth headset midway on multiple occasions so i guess its meant only for phones recommendation avoid buying
3972,1.0,camera quality is ok ok and brightness of the mobile in day is worst u cant even see clearly in day light and while talk u cant use data if u have activated only one data overall worthless to buy this mobile in this range
3973,4.0,awesome product but the price is little bit high
3974,4.0,the sole purpose i went for this phone is because of its sheer battery capacityand after using it to its optimum level after an entire day i have to say im more than impressed hats off to vivo for this beast the phone in itself has a premium feel to it the only downside is the weight it feels rather heavy when you hold it surely because of the battery however wouldnt have hurt if vivo had slimmed it down a notch the screen is huge and the resolution is so good that you cannot tell that its just an hd screen the screen navigation is seamless and very responsive to touch unlike xiaomi devices the funtouch os is easy and very userfriendly what sets this phone apart even more is that it offers w fast charging at this price which is a sweet deal even with a gb ram havent experienced any lag yet even after shuffling between apps simultaneously the rom however could have been better simulated as the basic configuration itself eats up over half of it leaving only around gb available i recommend that you go for a gb variant or purchase a memory card alternatively because if you are a heavy user of many apps gb just wont be enough i bought this to be used as a secondary phone hence the few kinks are passable however please dont look at this as a primary phone for heavy duty use allinall a full thumbsup to vivo for this phone for the price its quite a steal
3975,3.0,it takes more than hours to complete the charging from charge
3976,1.0,sound clarity and picture clarity not satisfaction loudspeaker sound clarity not satisfaction really i am feel this is bad experience
3977,5.0,such a great product easy to use awesome dslr easy to use great picture quality i am satisfied with it

4026,4.0,do not buy this if speed is an issue you want type at least for speed but this type works great in my phone to just increase storage i keep all my pictures on it and random files i have not used it for music but imagine that since it plays my videos included with my pictures that it could easily handle music
4027,2.0,there have been multiple occasions when the keyboard has slowed down immensely while composing a message becoming irresponsive to touch also the phone blanks out sometimes
4028,2.0,rate of speech cannot be altered specially in bedtime stories children dont understand the fast english accent is pathetic kids cant understand the accent its a good music player but poor assistant many a times the mic doesn work the biggest problem is the search criteria there is a lot of information which is on google that it deliberately does not pick it searches only from amazon search enginewikipedia
4029,3.0,im and lbs normally a size petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large i exchanged them for a size petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist didnt want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style sadly had to return my purchase

4034,3.0,front camera is average mi music app donot scan all songs from phone back camera is good there are lots of ads in preinstalled app screen is good ads are very annoying in some apps
4035,3.0,just a warning the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath im not a sparkle kinda gal so as soon as i saw that the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures to me it cheapens the whole dress which would otherwise be adorable
4036,5.0,its too good charging my phones
4037,1.0,started sucking with the very first usedistorted and breaking sound on first play feels like a fake or imitation product
4038,2.0,it is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph it made my foot frame look short and wide
4039,4.0,as per the price and name of the brand product is worthy its a great portable device as compare to logitech portable
4040,4.0,i tried this dress on in my local retailer and was pleasantly surprised it fitand looked cute as other reviewers have mentioned it runs small but it is super stretchy especially in the top portion with that said it accommodated my bust i have a g bust and it possess a problem for me when i try to buy dresses the top of this dress is pure elastic so it works the dress stretches on top but comes back inward on the bodyso i can show off my curves i have no idea what bra i can w

4042,1.0,fabric felt and looked cheap hem was completely frayed all the way around perhaps purposely but ratty looking all the same
4043,3.0,i was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks unfortunately i was very disappointed when i received it it is as a previous person said very much like a pajama top it is very loose and boxy and in my opinion did not flatter my shape at all sadly i will be returning it i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic or straight and slender as you suggest
4044,4.0,the inseam is advertised as but they are more like i was hoping they were for short people but they are for someone with very long legs event in my tallest heels id have to get them hemmed just a warning to my short friends out there the quality fit look was great but way way way too long
4045,4.0,found this at walgreens i love coconut scented stuff and coconut water and oil and milk are all awesome hydrating ingredients so i figured it was worth a try i also love that it is sulfate free both sodium laureth sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate this did a great job of cleansing my hair i had split end mender in my hair it actually created a creamy lather which is surprising because the formula is completely colorless and clear i have not experienced any dryness or uncharacteristic tangles typical of a shampoo that does not work well with my hair i believe i will like this shampoo i am always a fan of sulfatefree shampoos i cannot account for the matching conditioner im quite fond of my current conditioner so im going to stick to just using the shampoo from this line ill update later
4046,1.0,taking to hours to full charge output also slow if you view on price ok to buy but i am not recommend to buy it since i am not happy with its performance also amazon team wrongly updated the delivered status before reaching me and more than times contacted cusutomer care to receive this item fed up with amazon for poor quality of deliver and no proper hold on field deliver team also
4047,2.0,extremely disappointed with the earphones there is an extension wire you need to plug to insert earphones m happy with this mobile but wish they dint make this earphones insertion such a complicated process
4048,3.0,very slow and some times the folders take min to get opened unhappy ultimately
4049,2.0,no one came for installation of the product its not a accepted behaviour the delivery guy just dumps the product
4050,3.0,i know this is supposed to be a loose flowy fit which is exactly the style i love however this is beyond tentlike im weeks pregnant and i can probably fit two of me in my normal size small fabric is very thin and pattern looks like drab wallpaper huge bummer especially after seeing a few stars
4051,4.0,when i got this top in the mail i was impressed by the colors they were very vibrant and i loved the feel of the material as well however the top did not look good on i have an hourglass figure with a dd bust and the peplum just made me look like i didnt have a waist the arm holes were also very big and showed my bra overall i think this is a very cute top but would probably be better on women with more athletic figures
4052,5.0,the floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy but not with this top im usually wear sm with retailer brand depending with the design this tank has loose bottom section so the s is tts for me
4053,5.0,i love it
4054,1.0,stopped working within a year sparingly used
4055,2.0,this phone is too bad after buying this phone stopped working its receiving sound and after servicing of month again the same issue arised camera is the worst amongst its peers even redmi a had a better camera i dont play games on mobile so cant tell you battery life is good average usage long last for hrs as my internet always on but for hefty usage only hrs overall experience is waste of money
4056,3.0,this cardigan is very soft and feminine it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room if you dont mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater
4057,1.0,ill start by saying over the years i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailers products this dress represents all of my frustration cheap cheap cheap material low thread count elastic around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm i mean this dress is a total disaster and looks nothing like the photograph shown
4058,2.0,surprised with in day even not much usage battery was down by never expected mah battery at least to stand for days on continuous usage see today and return it if same thing happens
4059,5.0,except for the sound quality i overall love this product wish it had a front flash though they gave one in note pro then might as well could have given with this model but love the way this phone functions and pubg works pretty smoothly on this so its a steal deal for me
4060,1.0,the batteries are draining within days some liquid is coming out when all tv remotes are working long periods without battery replacement amazon should rectify battery problem urgently
4061,1.0,never even think of buying this phone mi claims it is an incredible phone it has a very good battery life good ergonomics light weight fine in display fingerprint reader supposedly first in segment which is so so slow now coming to cons it has a surprising bad screen not just bad but terribly awful p superamoled screen i had been using redmi s earlier that too had p screen but i never had any problem with it i wish mi had supplied p display even if meant a higher price for the phone the color production is very inaccurate text seems blurry geekyranjit said as i quote display is not very sharp i say its horrible worst in industry never buy p amoled display rather buy a phone with p lcd screen such a big downgrade compared to previous a and a although mi claims it has gorilla glass protection but how is it useful when you have such terrible display some tech reviewers say youll get used to as display thats a big big lie youll always find the text hazy and blurry and the colors to be in natural maybe even start to doubt your vision your eyes are fine its the display that is low grade
4062,5.0,bought this to use in our go pro white edition and it has worked well no issues recording time lapse or minutes of video at one time
4063,2.0,alot it doesnt know
4064,3.0,good looking phone decent performance
4065,4.0,camera is good for the price battery life is also good
4066,4.0,i am using fire tv stick from the last year i am very much happy with the device it has all the required features to turn your normal tv into smart smooth interface with no lags and compatibility with most of the apps except the google apps it totally does the job for media viewing experience update video added to show a demo of the interface and alexa functionality in the device hope it helps note do check if your tv supports a universal remote for controlling not every brand or model does that so onoff volume control and mute might or might not work the new remote that has ir feature now can turn your tv onoff and control the tv volume this is a very practical move which should have been included in the previous version supported famous appsgames prime video prime music hotstar netflix airtel cinema jio cinema zee viu youtube via thrid party apps firefox riptide gp asphalt but storage wont be enough crossy roads etc unsupported apps google photos google drive facebook jio tv airtel tv playstore pros easy to setup intuitive interface with curated content no stuttering or hangs with good internet speed supports phone mirroring casting support for prime videos youtube videos option to sideload apks very responsive remote remote app available to control from phone alexa for voice search above all its a stand alone device unlike chromecast cons the screen mirroring has a slight lag making it not suitable for gaming from phone voice search in the remote works only for the content in prime video does not have a great game collection limited storage and no sd card support slow startup times best to not switch off the adapter no option to add another amazon account only one account at a time conclusion if you are ok with using two remotes you can buy the previous version that is available at discounted price but if you dont then buy this without any hesitation either way you will have a great device for your family i just wish they increased the internal storage at least in this version so one star reduced only for that

4069,2.0,this was my first samsung phone i loved the os battery is a big plus decent camera but it struggles in the gb ram version within a week or so i got issues with bluetooth and wifi coonectivity speed over wifi is very less and it is difficult to connect to a new network bluetooth is signal is so weak that the sound start to breaks when held at few centimeters faulty unit
4070,1.0,i have other stevies and these are nothing like them the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny the pants themselves run very small in the waist approx two sizes too small compared with other stevies additionally the cuff is sewn like that in place and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves see how it gapes in the cuff on the model like a rounded bottom that is way more emphasized in real life buyer beware
4071,2.0,i purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color i hated the way the second one fit im concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked
4072,3.0,the colour in the discription was blue and the actual watch delivered was pink
4073,4.0,this great casual jacket has a confusing fit but if you know what you want and understand the style you can be surely happy with this plush smooth stadium coat first the neutralbeige fits a little easier but it is definitely larger in the body compared to the navy for both colors the shoulders and sleeves are fitted perhaps a little tight while the body has an aline flare and subtle hilo hem the neutral really flares out a lot while the blue is a gentle flare if you have narrow shou
4074,5.0,good but in comparison with selfie camera the rear one is weak present cost of the product is decreasing hence feeling cheated
4075,5.0,great product for personal listings
4076,3.0,i loved this dress and ordered it online i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point ultimately i decided to return it as i couldnt justify spending on a dress that didnt seem as well made as i would expect from retailer

4089,3.0,as per budget and fetures mobile is very nice but i faced a problem in this mobile power key of mobile became non ops after months and when i asked customer care to provide me a copy of bill so that i could give it to service centre but amazon was not able to provide the copy of bill horrible experience from amazon
4090,4.0,fridge works fine delivery was smooth thanks to amazon cooling is perfect i like ittakes less space and good enough for two people
4091,5.0,i was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model
4092,3.0,i fell in love with this romper and it was my goto for any given day but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere so i had to return it

4098,2.0,this dress fit so oddly i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly the dress wasnt tight at my hips in either size it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out maybe i was too short couldnt figure it out the color and detailing are beautiful though a little tight in the bust
4099,5.0,suberb quality in its segment looking at its size one cant imagine this much bass and sound quality the only cons is that battery life is not that much good but still its good enough for domestic usage
4100,3.0,i love the color coralpink and the open shoulder design of this top but its too blousy at the bottom way too much fabric i ordered a small i am and lbs i might try an xs if they still have them in stock fabric is comfortable the ties on the sleeves add a special touch

4112,3.0,purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering the one problem was that when you raise your arms the sweater also rises to expose your torso it was returned
4113,5.0,this is the second of the new dress batch i have purchased and it is lovely this catalog shot does not do it justice the colors are brighter but not neon lots of indigo and coral there is a tad of yellow the bodice makes my aa size look much more the bodice fits me perfectly as the top pleating is flat the v neck is just right not too low and the back is even prettier the dress just fell gracefully out of the package without a wrinkle and without a mussed pleat that was a sh

4153,4.0,i bought a size small lbs it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much i ended up looking hippy with no butt the material is nice and it is a nice quality i just didnt have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area
4154,2.0,i bought the echo dot during amazons sale event when it arrived setup was more or less straight forwardi googled things alexa was able to do especially the jokes and easter eggs this proved very entertaining for one evening then got old so i turned to alexas other featuresthe dot was not compatible with my smart lighting system which really disappointed me there was one thing i really hoped the device would do for me read a web page my dyslexia makes reading half as fast for me as the average person and i really like listening to books and having say an essay dictated to me while i quickly jot down notes plus you can listed while driving i actually imagined getting one just for my car alexa will not do thisthe google now feature on my android which ive been using for years has significantly more capabilities than amazons alexa i have an app on my phone that will read an entire document to me i can place a call using only my voice a surprisingly new feature for alexa that amazon was only recently able to roll outi returned the echo dot and was given a refund i imagine this product will be much better in five years but for the time being i think im better off just talking to myself
4155,1.0,here is the thing it will work for a while then things will fall apart i use pandora a lot and there is no consistent way to get an alexa product to play a pandora station forget the tricks about what to say after a few months you will not be able to play anything but the last station you picked there is no way to choose a station from the app that will work basically you will only be able to play a single station from pandora are there other uses for an alexa device sure but after failing at the most obvious why on earth would you even think about exploring other uses you know for a fact that even if they work at first they will fail later junk software

4160,4.0,i love the idea of this shirt the embroidered pattern is fun and summery the fit of the shirt is a little strange i saw that in other reviews but i had to see for myself it is rather boxy i think i may keep it though i will look cute with super fitted skinny jeans to balance out the boxiness of the top
4161,2.0,after using the product for only months the right earpiece started showing problem and within days both the earpieces did not work i tried to contact the services via troll free number given by amazon but the number is always busy overall not satisfied with the product not a good choice at this price level go for other brands

4206,4.0,i really do not understand it too much yet but learning slowly wanting to connect to both computers and tv and have not had too much success yet might be user error but slowly i will get it other than that so far i like the concept
4207,2.0,the wire from the band to the ears is too long previously i was using skull candy which i lost so went in for a cheaper option skull candy wire length was perfect in boats rockerz because the wire is too long it keeps bumping against my neck when i run the sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces also when i do floor exercises the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck sound quality and battery life is decent for the price though so if you plan to buy it for casual listening go ahead wouldnt recommend for serious workouts

4277,2.0,purchased this in two colors online purchased in an xs i am usually a s or xs the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering returning both
4278,3.0,just good
4279,5.0,this is just the perfect sweater in my opinion i got it in the rose which is a gorgeous subtle color that will go with just about anything i love the knit pattern and the buttons and the sleeves are nice and long which is crucial for me at my height overall i just see myself throwing this on over everything so im sure i will treasure this for years to come
4280,2.0,the side of fridge like steel water is coming dont buy this fridge

4284,4.0,good mobile in budget apart from bit heating issue rest is fine
4285,4.0,i love the idea and color very flattrering and easy to trhrow on however i need the petite in this one and they sold out in the neutral color it looks too big in eregular sizing and since it combines xss it is made slightly bigger material is soft enough
4286,4.0,i ordered a size xl it ran small especially compared to other retailer xl tops the quality of the material was great as was the embroidery i wish it fit because i definitely would have kept it very pretty tee
4287,4.0,nice out look
4288,1.0,i usually dont post bad reviews on amazon as i love their services and products but this was an exceptionally awful product i wonder if amazon even tested this product before launching it i had preordered it and was very excited about the fact that finally a k streaming device at a fairly reasonable price was here which will become my sole source of entertainment i gotta give amazon the credit for doing a great job of disillusioning me as all the expectations i had of this product were dashed at once my issues with the product were the same as some of the customers have already mentioned in their reviews it has this terrible notsouserfriendly remote that drain its battery faster than you can imagine hdr content is dimmed looks super ugly and dull as opposed to showing a detailed and highresolution image the audio at times either didnt play at all or would mute dialogues with only background music playing which was quite irritating not that i didnt check all the settings properly i didnt waste my time in calling customer service as i had already read some poor reviews about the product which helped me conclude that there was no resolution to these issues i had because thats how the product was developed needless to say i returned the product got my refund and then proceeded to buy apple tv k by personally visiting an apple store i researched online and i only found positive reviews about it the price is undoubtedly a little steep but if you own an oled and a sound bar that supports dolby digital ch or dolby atmos you will have a delightful experience and wont have to worry about buying anything new for the next years at least because apple tv k reigns supreme
4289,2.0,battery life was poorsome times hanging and some times restarting during worknow after monts its sometimes not responding during calls

4291,2.0,bad service and body quality is also badit os produce too much heat
4292,3.0,over all this phone is very good phone but for multitasking its performance not good for gaming it suffers
4293,5.0,note no fingerprint reader in the phone so please consider it as the review of face id the product is really good no doubt it arrived on time and the product was secured and sealed plus overall packaging was good the product was not tampered with but the only issue is that of the bill inside which was crumbled tattered and half torn the phone is ofcourse not updated to the latest ios so that is what you can see happening in the picture i would recommend the phone and the seller but only if he starts sending the bill properly
4294,5.0,mi a no doubt best camera phone after note probut biggest drawback no mm jack and bit disappointed with battery performance
4295,3.0,alexa doesnt have enough answers for me but its fun t have for time weather and as a tv remote
4296,3.0,i had high hopes for this jumpsuit for a holiday party but it is a very odd fit im normally a preferably a petite i ordered this in a large and i couldnt begin to zip it up it also ran extremely short in the crotch area very pretty print but its going back
4297,5.0,sandisk is the best brand in my oppinion gb is a great size to put music video etc recommend it
4298,1.0,i rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever but this dress is awful i ordered the black and white the fabric is very poor quality the colors are washed out i almost didnt try it on but i did and found that for me the fit was terrible though some of the reviewer pictures are cute
4299,2.0,this sweater i bought to go with a navy dress it is not ivory it is sortof a blush color not at all what i had in mind the sweater itself is pretty the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it definite return
4300,5.0,i was a little worried this top wouldnt look quite as nice as it does online due to the price but it is super cute in person too tank underneath is attached but does not get in the way great top cannot wait to wear it

4306,2.0,after having used the yes to cucumbers shampoo as my slsfree shampoo for the past couple of months my hair was feeling rather dry besides that a hairdresser completely messed up my hair recently leaving it damaged and brittleand not in the color i wanted because i color my hair and want to do my best to keep the color as solid as possibleso i dont have to make as many trips to the salon i was looking for a new slsfree shampoo and soon enough my attention was drawn to the line of ogx shampoos a bit pricey but still lower priced than your standard salon shampoos i decided to look up some reviews online and the opinions on ogx shampoos were very mixed the coconut milk seemed to be the highest rated shampoo out of the bunch as desperate as i was for a new shampoo i decided to bite the bullet and bought this shampoo anyways the pros and the cons the pros has a very pleasant coconut scent that leaves your shower smelling nice produces quite a lot of lather for an sls free shampoo i didnt need a lot of product for my rather long hair so i think the bottle could last me quite a while the cons it takes a lot of work to rinse this out properly and its hard to feel when the product is completely washed out of your hair so its hard to tell if youve rinsed well enough this did nothing for my rootsscalp but made the ends of my hair very greasy i find this odd because the ends of my hair are usually quite dry normally id wash my hair every to days while using this shampoo i have to wash my hair every dayevery other day this is a huge con for me because i dont like greasy hair and i dont like washing it often because i dont want my color to fade too quick conclusion i shouldve listened to the negative reviews and so should you potential buyer dont buy this shampoo there are lots of better shampoos on the market for a better price this stuff weighs your hair down and makes it greasy i dont want a shampoo to make my hair greasy i want a shampoo to gentlyclean my hair sorry ogx but this shampoo is a disappointment
4307,3.0,its mobile is good and camera quality is good battery bakup long time
4308,1.0,annoying to try to get setup
4309,4.0,battery capacity issue
4310,5.0,superb
4311,3.0,enjoy talking to it but cant answer some of my questions ie what music do you have for me choose cant understand it sometimes
4312,4.0,i have been looking at rompers for a while but being that im a lot of stores seem to carry rompers that are super short i think these are the perfect length for summer and for me its cute i am and pounds and i ordered the xs i docked one start because the top part seems to have a bit of excess fabric if i pull the waist up the top balloons out a little awkwardly but if i pull the shorts down so that the drawstring is resting lower than my natural waist it looks okay
4313,4.0,i love pilco jeans they fit in all the right ways for a size this is a great pair of everyday casual jeans a tiny bit oversized in the ankle a bit of a flair but overall i am very happy very comfortable
4314,2.0,initially i really liked this conditioner it is at a very affordable price point and i love the packaging and the scent it worked fine at first but after using it for a while i noticed how frizzy and dry my hair was becoming i dont heat style my hair anymore but this conditioner did terrible things to my ends it made it seem like all id done with straighten my ends over and over in terms of the dryness and frazzled look i also noticed that it made my scalp so dry that i got dandruff it made my scalp itch and flake like crazy i also at one point tried washing my makeup brushes with this they ended up slightly stiffer than they used to be i also tried using this as a shaving cream when i ran out for a brief period it made my legs so dry that they looked grey and this is coming from someone who is tan all year round overall i would not recommend this conditioner however ogx makes some other conditioners that i really love like the coconut curls conditioner
4315,4.0,ok love this top im b and the reg fits perfect on the top half i am going to have the waist taken in because i love the top it is very short i usually need a petite but the regular is just barely long enough i thought it was red and white but it is red and beige great with jeans or navy for work
4316,1.0,very bad products no clarity only red red screen old stock manufacturers kavin service very bad
4317,5.0,this sd card is perfect for my phone it is the right size and especially the right price after looking all over amazon price for this card was almost lower than everyone elses
4318,1.0,speaker quality is bad it is very painful when you talk for a couple of minutes
4319,3.0,i bought both black and white shirt white is see through completely black is ok but the material is still too thin i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash not worth the money i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap
4320,4.0,its not an amazing product but definitely worth the money you spend battery life is alright you need to charge it every days it adds steps when you drive or travel in a vehicle unless the roads are super smooth but i found it not tracking steps when i walk without moving my hands while holding a phone or something so the steps displayed are usually close to the steps i take in a day
4321,5.0,great to have this device in my loft i can control my thermostat down stairs
4322,1.0,the back cam was not at all working
4323,3.0,navigation is not very intuitive and smooth the remote is not very responsive and keys are difficult to operate
4324,2.0,i was so excited to get this classiclooking retailer dress i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print the popsicle print on this dress is really truly adorable unfortunately the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest and im only a b ladies so be warned at the same time the arm holes were huge i mean massively big i think if you have a swimmers body this might work otherwise youll for sure nee
4325,4.0,i wanted the blight yellow as photo with navy flower motifs however it was much more darker as on the tag mustard if you like its color you will like it
4326,2.0,maybe its because im but this top was underwhelming i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big obnoxious bow on the back it does look cute on the model so maybe its a younger top i would have felt silly wearing it
4327,4.0,great looking casual dress but im not sure about the fit on me the skirt drape may be a tad overwhelming on my short legs if i want to emulate the styling of the green model bodice fabric is a nice clingy but lined stretch material of medium thickness the skirt is a thin crepe viscoserayon without a lining and i think it really needs one i was hoping the skirt was the same material mix like the elysian maxi i picked the medium petite and sizing down would be appropriate for ladies with
4328,1.0,i am lbs ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized it fit like a parachute you could fit about of me in the bottoms and very short nice quality material but extremely awkward fit
4329,3.0,after seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out i was curious about it but thought i was out of luck it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size i tried it and wasnt sold however i loved the color it was snug across the shoulders and arms the rest was somewhat flowy but boxy at the same time i ended up bringing it home to think on it after trying it on again i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t
4330,3.0,i live in ny and bought his coat for the winter thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm this coat is extremely thing more like a springfall coat and therefore i dont think the price justifies the quality i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely
4331,4.0,the dot is great it does everything you would expect it to do my only complaint is that it doesnt always catch what you say however it does a great day job picking up orders the other of the time
4332,3.0,needs to expand its scope of skills many general questions about various topics like history economics etc csnt be answered without relying on wikipedia great for playing music and answering weatherrelated questions though
4333,5.0,display setting like contrast saturation brightness is not available
4334,3.0,so i posted a review on this shampoo and conditioner previously but since then i have noticed that my hair sheds sooooo bad after i use them and i know its this product because my hair never sheds so bad like it does with this stuff im talking like handfuls of hairscary right yeah im going to give these away cuz i dont wanna waste them im disappointed cuz these make my hair soft and it smells great but i cant deal with losing that much hair
4335,4.0,overall good mobile this prices
4336,5.0,this top is lovely its got a decent length to it so it can be tucked into nice pants or a skirt the gold beading design on the shoulders is a little heavy which can sometimes cause it to slipsag off the shoulder not entirely off but enough to reveal a bra strap for a kind of offshoulder look its very flattering if you tuck it in or even if you dont i got this top in red and its lovely a little more towards than coral side than crimson
4337,3.0,best phone for those who using smart phone for the first time processor is too slow

4347,4.0,this skirt is stretchy and really comfortable i love the color the only complain is it gives a little magnification to the low belly on me at least very flattering for the behind though
4348,3.0,this product is straight down the middle of average for me i absolutely adored the scent and the texture of the conditioner was nice and creamy but i didnt find it was anything close to a quottherapyquot for my hair it did the job of a conditioner but didnt stand out as any better than cheapie palmolive or tresseme types for the price which i paid aud there are much better conditioners out there matrixs hyrdatherapie range costs about the same and moisturises my hair triple the amount that the keratin therapy conditioner did give it a go if youre looking for a basic conditioner that will give your hair a gorgeous smell but dont expect any miracles
4349,5.0,i expected this to be a pretty basic peasant top but was pleasantly surprised with all aspects of my purchase fabric is soft and flowing with a perfect feminine vibe it has a nice liner and the length and fit are perfect can be dressed up or down as you like it does run a bit large but its due to the style not the sizing i ordered my usual size and cannot be happier with it go aheadpress the button

4354,3.0,these pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size which may not be what you usually wear i have several pair but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product now that said i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants and the outcome was successful i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t
4355,5.0,my husband whom did not want this loves it
4356,3.0,i wanted to love this dress so much and am so sad it just didnt work for me i am pounds still trying to lose that last from my third daughter and the chestback of this dress was so tight i was afraid if i hugged someone it would split up the back i am normally a size and tried the p p and and they were all too tight in the chestback it sounds like this is common for these holding horses dresses

4364,5.0,i really enjoy the generous storage space that my samsung galaxy siii has every once in a long while i have to unmountremount the drive but i doubt its the card and most likely the phone i would highly recommend
4365,3.0,if camera is your main priority forget about this phone you need to have very high outdoor lighting to capture gud images but practically normal images sucks
4366,2.0,i read the existing reviews before purchasing and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer i figured by ordering a medium i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater this was not the case the sweater is short does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind and i assume the model is taller than ias models are usually tall for reference i am medium build
4367,2.0,i ordered this dress in a xs petite i am lbs the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back it might work on taller people like the model but i would steer clear if you are a petite
4368,3.0,fingers painted bhandh
4369,4.0,one of the best iphone i have ever used battery life very goodcamera quality has no match when it comes to shooting videos from xr overall a perfect phone
4370,3.0,i have the long sleeved version of this dress and was super excited to try on the sleeveless version but it just didnt work nearly as well the armholes are huge and will definitely show quite a bit of bra the black pattern was also nothing special i like the mock turtleneck and the dress has a nice swingy feel would consider getting it if it went on sale i tried on the small and the extra small didnt notice a difference between the two i think i have on the xs in the photo
4371,2.0,not toogood

4376,3.0,i loved this top when i saw it online and i still love the idea of it unfortunately the execution of the design fell short im w a long lean torso i ordered my usual small and the arms on the shirt were so long bc of the way the sides of the top cut up and my d chest i dont think a petite would work for me such a cute top but it just wont work for me
4377,3.0,the bass quality is good but the volume is too low for a portable speaker but not that bad led effect is awesome in for a month warranty it is a peaceful purchase
4378,2.0,the worst power bank you can find in the market has a malfunction problem all the light blinks simultaneously which means there is an issue with the power bank
4379,2.0,soft ha i think not this made my hair super dry i have short normal slightly wavy hair it looked dirty and it started falling out do not buy
4380,2.0,hmm this is my first time buying this product i bought it at watson and it was about even with discount oo i dont know about you but thats a little too pricey for me nevertheless i gave it a try because the scent was fantasic heres my opinion the lather is too i had to use about palm size for my shoulder length hair i felt that it was not enough and i dont think i can get use to this kind of consistency whereby it is not thick sorry for poor explanation it was strange that the top felt dry and the middle felt okok and the ends felt fab i think it is too drying for me btw i have a dry scalp and oily hair now im using this as my conditioner just to finish it however i do not recommend this
4381,4.0,nice phone and it looks a real beast for gaming
4382,2.0,colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and thats where it ends cheap flimsy polyester and no lining far too expensive for what it is on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great i would say it runs a tad big but in my case i have wide shoulders not big enough to downsize too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress
4383,3.0,i found these to fit odd i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering i am usually a and the fit but just did not look good
4384,1.0,the cellphone automatically disconnects the call after seconds of ongoing call the message occurs as mobile network not available
4385,3.0,everything is ok except camera very bad camera its not a mp triple rear camera the camera is like full of small dots like dust front camera also of very bad quality
4386,3.0,battery dren very fast
4387,2.0,there is really no reason to get this unless you cannot afford the better echos i have three regular st gen echos and two of these echo dots i also have preordered the next gen echo plusthe problem is that this thing sounds bad due to the poor speakers in a tiny and cost efficient design there is no rotary top that adjusts volume like the regular echo and worst of all and the reason i will be getting rid of these when the next gen echo plus comes out is that the microphone is so poor that it cannot detect my softly spoken voice from less than feet away the st gen echo in the living room can detect my somewhat louder voice in the kitchen when it is almost feet away around the corner with two walls in between it and me its a deal breaker for me and i will get rid of it once i have the echo plus
4388,2.0,as a beach coverup this would be great but im surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesnt show on the model how thin it is its pretty sheer and i couldnt get away without layering it
4389,1.0,this is an extremely flattering dress i couldnt resist buying it even though i didnt come into the store looking for a dressier dress which i feel this is once i tried it on i had to purchase it its one of those things that i know i wont regret because at some point an occasion will show up that ill wear it to its soft comfy and flowing and accentuates the bodys curves without being too tight or clingy its a classic
4390,4.0,nice laptop in this price
4391,5.0,this picture does not due this sweater justice at all i purchased this today for summer its beyond cute and the colors are awesome its a very light sweater with a fitted but not too tight light feel the sleeves are a little longer than quarter length at least on me it looks amazing with white pants very fresh

4400,3.0,i really dont know what to think about this i got it thinking it would solve my memory problems but thats not the case turns out you can only put certain things on this and of course none of the thingsthat are eating up your memory onyour will go there is a way to swap your internal memory for your external card but its not easy and you have to root your phone
4401,3.0,this dress was as pretty in real life as the picture flattering also unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work even though it appears so in the picture the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show unless you dont need one also it was much tighter on top than the model picture even though the rest fit perfectly
4402,3.0,brightness very lessmay set having some defects will contact for resolve the matter

4418,3.0,description says otg compatible but otg doesnt work
4419,2.0,this device is not what was expected the information and music playing options all seem to need downloading plus it pushes one to buy the amazon music packages rather than simply acquiring a radio signal yes one may download the free apps but other than a specific genre of music these arent any different than simply tuning in on available stations everything seems to need a wifi link and not simply a connection forget downloading via a laptop that isnt wireless very strongly considering returning this item as it hasnt matched the expectations considered when ordering it yes disappointed is an appropriate word

4424,2.0,the sweater material was really soft and seemed wellmade the back is an interesting twist but the material creases easily i can see it looking messy by the end of the day the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large i got my usual s and i could have sized down maybe even sizes i didnt like it enough to try a smaller size

4429,1.0,i bought this phone on th february everything about the phone is disappointing fast charging the phone takes hours to charge percent the touch sensitivity is horrible it takes touches for a single action apps keep on opening by themselves leave the phone unlocked and just watch it sends messages calls random people from your contacts all by itself the only good thing about this is that asphalt plays well
4430,3.0,it doesnt work with me only because i have very skinny arm i can not handle the arm part of the dress it is still very pretty though i would keep it if i fit the arm

4447,1.0,very standard mobile
4448,3.0,this is pretty average i favor the macadamia oil in the organix line since it is more hydrating for my dry hair but this does feel weightless and helps control frizz it has some slight smoothing abilities and provides shine there are better oils that i have tried but this is not too bad if you are looking for a basic hair oil these go on sale quite regularly so i would hold off on purchasing them full price

4451,1.0,the picture quality is not good resolution is poor with hd connection of my dth connected through an hdmi cable even though its an hd ready tv i didnt find any difference in picture quality with hdmi and rca inputs greenish hue with pixelated appearance of the image was seen even in close view perhaps defective sound quality is okay in low volume but clarity is lost and crackles with medium to high volume the built is flimsy but i admire amazon for its customer care services for smooth return and refund of the product for which i would give five stars

4464,3.0,im keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity i wore with super skinny white jeans and casual heel im short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you
4465,1.0,i was looking for a new shampooconditioner and brought this it smells divine i love the smell of mandarin oranges since it reminds me of my childhood but my hair did not feel clean after using this it did not lather well probably because it has no sulfate it smells great but thats about it it did not clean my hair and it did not make it any softer or healthier actually i think it made my hair worse i have curly hair btw but bottom line i think this is a waste of money and i would never repurchase i didnt even finish the bottle i brought a different shampoo and concitioner because this is absolutely terrible

4480,1.0,not completely satisfied with the product as the dual sim on iphone is way too complicated battery and camera features is the best of xr recommend not to buy iphone online as i got a used phone
4481,3.0,i like the style and the design of this culottes but the texture of the fabric will caught on any rough surface i had a few loose loops for just one wear so it will be nice to wear for work or shopping but not good to go to the park or play with kids

4486,2.0,unlike the other two reviews i found this dress horrid i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s it was just too much fabric for me i have a small frame so it was just so overwhelming the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me colors were nice and fabric was soft and light the belt made no sense as others have said length was good i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldnt take it off fast enough i literally ran to the post office and back it goes this is my
4487,2.0,i tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress
4488,4.0,phone is excellent other than poor battery performance also i feel call volume is not upto the mark
4489,4.0,except screen quality rest are good screen seems dim even with full brightness
4490,3.0,i have got this for rs and for this range for the wireless headphone it is a good deal sound is ok and comfortable to use it did not fall from ear as there is some locking type of thing which holds the earpiece in its place nice product it may feel this way because i used to airpod from apple

4497,4.0,i think this dress is beautiful i ordered it for my brothers wedding but the nude slip underneath made the dress look a bit too revealing i may keep it for a holiday party though because it really is gorgeous and super flattering it dies run large typically im a and the fit perfectly
4498,3.0,it needs a lot of programing information into the echo as where siri is already to go
4499,2.0,it hangs a lot of times its fingerprints is very bad it takes a lot of time to unlock by fingerprints its processor is is very slow but its camera quality is very nice i prefer to dont buy it
4500,4.0,this tunic is very cute and incredibly comfortable it is a bit loose but you can see that on the model that it hangs off the body i lose my waist a little bit in this but think its a good substitute for a thin sweatshirt and the button detail at the neck is nice if you want to show a little cleavage
4501,2.0,got used one likeit will return to the seller

4506,1.0,writing his review after months of usage i had great expectations when i bought this brand but i now ended up repenting my buy my refrigerator has stopped cooling even after a service guy tried to repair it it still doesnt work per service centre representative there was a leakage with the gas and they had to replace it with some older model replacement and now they have placed an order for my model this shouldnt have had happened with reputed brands as such however disappointed with the buy adding after months of usage now my refrigerator broke down thrice in months now never repented this muchone may want to reconsider before buying this model
4507,3.0,average phone camera quality poorcamera blind in sunlightno extra headphone jack low battery life
4508,1.0,bad prodect getting very slow hanging
4509,1.0,ok phone battery sucks drains out too fast you play pubg for a game done charge
4510,3.0,im not really super sold on this because i have to use a lot of it to smooth my hair it might be my lack of blow drying skills but i use a lot of this when im blowing out my hair and its only shoulder length my hair still needs a flat iron after i dry it and it feels a little dry if i use it without mixing in any other product lately ive been mixing it with some of the argan oil from another line of theirs and i really like the way thats been working the smell is great stays in my hair and lasts into the next day if i blow my hair out at night ill use the rest of the bottle that i have but probably try something else in the organix line next for blowouts
4511,2.0,love the idea of this top but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap the quality reminds me of something you would buy for at a market abroad definitely disappointed with the quality for the price will be retuning

4516,4.0,i agree with the other reviews great dress i got a ton of compliments on it but i had to take it to a tailor to get it taken in not a fan of belts with dresses but definitely wanted it so had quite a bit taken in not sure why this seems to be a reoccurring issue with retailer i was bummed i had to spend money to get the dress to look even somewhat like the photo
4517,3.0,phone and battery work as expected but camera suck after taking pic if you just zoom little bit image fade dont buy if you love to take pictures very disappointed despited they provide mp triple camera my old iphone s capture better camera with mp camera
4518,2.0,thick and full not so much i picked it up because it was sulfatefree but boy oh boy does it dry my hair out it basically made my hair like dull and dead i know its supposed to be chemicalfree but i dont think its supposed to kill your hair i used up the bottle only because it was so pricey but i definitely wont be picking this one up again
4519,2.0,i love finding unique retailer pieces that dont require dry cleaning i was excited to find this shirt but its not flattering the bottom hem is a little tight which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips i also didnt like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person ill be returning this item
4520,5.0,great addition
4521,5.0,v nic
4522,3.0,body is made of cheap plastic camera is very bad battery is like mah performance was good they dont enable some basic options like animation in phone overall look very cheaper than realme c i think realme c is better and premium look
4523,5.0,good so far
4524,2.0,doesnt generate oily scalp but also doesnt really condition my hair its not drier but it is frizzier not sure how that works but there you go the smell is pretty neutral one of those products that really doesnt do anything other than add an extra step and make me think i am doing something productive in the shower
4525,3.0,its bettery never reach to i recently observe this the power hardly stands for maximum if we are listening music worst case if we connect it to smart tv then it last only for minutes if its charged bad product dont buy it
4526,2.0,so much extra fabric not something i would recommend buying online
4527,1.0,got the delivery and surprised to see that camera and flashlight are not working rear camera is not working in camera app and facetime flashlight doesnt work attached screenshots requested for replacement and waiting for amazon confirmation will update once i have further updates
4528,5.0,this is my first apple product and i would say this is an excellent buy with amazing looks and fit and finish is perfect yes it take some time to adjust in ios but so far its performance is really good and i would also thanks amazon for a quick and safe delivery know i understand why apple charges so much for there products because they provide quality

4540,2.0,i was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to readand now i know better the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos the sleeves however ran small compared to the body the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso the body the oppositetoo large and not flattering on an hourglass figureno darts no fitted places nothing making it tailored to fit open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette buttoned it sprea
4541,2.0,im happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me im and lbs and it made me look like i had gained lbs as others have said the pockets make the dress even worseits very hard to get them to lay flat the material is lovely soft and i liked the gray color but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum
4542,4.0,product quality seems harder then expectations which may get damage due to hardness
4543,3.0,huh i use an assortment of shampoos and conditioners and my hair is usually shiny but i noticed that my scalp which is oily and greasy wasis getting really really dry after reading the reviews here my guess that is it probably from this shampoo thats really too bad because i love the smell and i now have a huge bottle of it
4544,3.0,these are very well constructed medium weight besutiful leggings
4545,1.0,i need bill of my mobile

4548,1.0,worst mobile dont ever prefer mi mobiles these mobile r built with very low quality material i came up with problem with sound camera and also about battery worst
4549,4.0,i like the way it was simply superb but i felt a problem while using mobile on lying down it doesnt respond properly screen suddenly changes from normal to zoom and gestures doesnt work properly when i touch the screen this is the only problem which i experience since a month
4550,1.0,not as per specifications and does not meeting my expectations but as ur executive said they cant do anything if i made any mistake i have to pay and live with it because its amazon here customer is punish for his mistakes no mercy if u have taken product i have to be with it no placement no return only headache
4551,1.0,my phone is not compatible i have to return it
4552,4.0,i loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt i ended up getting the despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the at this length with my height and amount of material became overwhelming on me it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well
4553,2.0,hate i have to return it way too longalmost more mid thighalmost dress length
4554,5.0,i trired this one and lvoed it right away the cut is flattering but the sleeves are a little long so ordering petite the red color is like a wine color very nice i also ordered green to see the color in person i am not sure which i will keep can be worn with anything really jeans pants or skirts or dresses
4555,4.0,phone is good but accessibility options are less compared to other phones in market
4556,1.0,camera is bad not worth the money battery too slow in charging pure waste of money if u want to buy basic phone plz go ahead with this
4557,2.0,the worst part of this phone is it keeps hanging from the very first day itself
4558,4.0,very nice bookevery content is very important
4559,3.0,sound is not so good as expected from jbl im disappointed
4560,2.0,this dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on even the sz was too loose and shapeless there is no waist as pictured the hilow hem loose fit and wavy waist seam see in the third closeup picture make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash its really too bad its such a pretty combination of patterns
4561,5.0,his pen must be a magical wand that created such a book
4562,3.0,i was really excited for this sweater its not terrible but its not great the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it i would try a different sweater
4563,5.0,this is such a neat dress the color is great and the fabric is super soft i am tall so the long length was an added bonus it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps i am going to pair it with a funky tank top necklaces and boots super cute
4564,4.0,pretty good price great performance ive been using micro sd cards for years tried many brands mostly cheaper there is a reason theyve been around and will continue to be
4565,4.0,earlier i was using realme which i found great mobile than u lunched i liked the notch it makes the device good looking the battery life is promising and finger print scanner is too good sometimes the camera doesnt give great clicks but it is fair at this price
4566,4.0,bass is not up to the mark
4567,1.0,paper quality is as if it is fake or duplicate
4568,3.0,i did like this dress it has a good simple shape and is very comfortable however its plain and for the price and it being dry clean only ill wait to see if itll go on sale its also worth noting that im and was uncomfortable with the length of the petite but the regular size was a good length right at the knees
4569,3.0,i liked the idea of this tshirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple however i feel that it was overpriced for the quality its a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale
4570,3.0,i get that its a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all
4571,3.0,beautiful dress appears wellmade but unfortunately i wasnt able to get it on about inch gap in the zipper over chest area first time ive ever sent something back to retailer for not fitting
4572,5.0,the quality of the screen is simply amazing with gb ram on top of it makes it better than best of all is the no cost emi option must buy dont wait
4573,4.0,the first reviewer said it was small in the bust but the p i ordered fit everywhere rib cage and all but was gaping at the bust in the back i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down it would be too snug in the rib cage i am dd for reference there and waist is inches otherwise the make is very pretty i like the texture in the fabric the color is very pretty as well embroidery seemed high quality but i decided to pass on it even on sale since it didnt
4574,4.0,grandchildren love it check weather before going out or for latest music
4575,5.0,exactly as pictured great fit love it
4576,4.0,im not usually a fan of ruffles but this blouse has a very smooth and flowing front its flattering and feminine without looking frilly easy to dress up or down
4577,3.0,id been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews when it went on sale i thought id try but it was like a tent on me the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo too bad because the color was gorgeous could have been a favorite of looked like photo
4578,4.0,beautiful material and taupe color the slits are pretty high on both sides so just be aware of that
4579,1.0,this dress is not flattering the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy like the other reviewer said its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didnt help regardless the length is not accurate either i would say its a pretty short dress mid thigh but that probably depends on the person it also makes you look very horizontal i was really excited about this dress but its getting r

4586,3.0,samsung galaxy ms is a overall good mobile under k but the camera quality is below average i gave it one star coz there is no option for star in review i would like to request samsung that the company should be honest while advertising the product the monster camera is just the name camera quality is really bad like a megapixel camera photo are blurry and has a lot noise in the pictures if anyone want a camera mobile then the a series in samsung is way better then this or you can go for vivo zx or realme xt etc im not happy with this purchase coz camera is a mandatory part of mobile and im disappointed with this phone in camera quality
4587,1.0,had a terrible time getting it set up and it will not stay connected to my wifi i have a very good internet connection with gb speed the device frequently takes repeat commands before responding and more often than not responses are inappropriate to my prompts having to reestablish the wifi connection every morning and evening really defeats any idea of convenience very disappointed returning item
4588,2.0,the design and quality were great i really wanted them to fit but they ran large im and lbs and orderd the small unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i wont be trying a size down the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward sadly these went back
4589,2.0,this was not what i was expecting at all i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around the large fit like a small on me and not like a typical oversized sweater type small but a normal fitted top small a previous reviewer said it is long and straight and i think that is a good description for it i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extralarge or a different cut of the

4596,1.0,im lbs i ordered a mediumregular the dress fell three inches above my knees this model is taller than i am and it falls to her kneesdoesnt make sense i think retailer sends petites in place of regular
4597,2.0,i am fine with all functionalities of this remote works perfectly fine and i can avoid my tv remote also because it works for my tv also i give a bad feedback from a sustainability standpoint which is its battery consumption behavior it drains battery like anything and i need to keep on changing it frequently the irritating fact is that most functions except volume and power onoff of the remote stalls when battery gets weaker forcing you to change it amazon needs to do something to reduce this battery wastage and reduce battery waste from accumulating

4600,3.0,i purchased this dress in my usual petite size it fit me quite well for the most part a bit tight around the armpit area but the major issue for me was with the front of the dress there was a weird pocket of extra fabric under my chest area im small chested also the bow across the back did not cover my bra strap below the bow which made me think i needed to size up im not sure if that would have fixed the weird fit in the front but i just decided to return the dress in the end the
4601,4.0,this is a gorgeous dress with a great boho styling the color in person is exactly as its shown it is wearable all throughout the year easily paired with boots or sandals while the fit is true to size i found the lace detailing has no stretch to it so the bodice is a little tight i love this dress and cant wait to wear it
4602,3.0,nice cut but inches too long and no petite sizes available
4603,1.0,phone is very bad and automatically screen lineing
4604,5.0,good product with the price range
4605,3.0,i heard this as an amazing product i have used it before and had a nice experience unfortunately the product i bought is not upto the mark the battery drains off so fast i could hardly charge a mah battery device for only one time it does not serve as a power bank at all i would say my mobile phone serves better

4607,1.0,i am reviewing this product after using it for almost a month for most it would work well as they travel a lot and might need some instant juice for their cell phone batteries but for those who dont travel a lot and not play games for more than hours a day this is just waste of your money if you already have a k mah battery installed this product distroys your battery and reduces your battery life by rd a day earlier i used to charge my cell phone in the morning and after full day utilization i still had some battery but once i used this product it instantly charged my cell phone within mins whereas the original charger took almost hr mins to charge the battery fast charging since i used this product my cell phones battery life is miserable and the device dies twice a day on me suggestion dont buy if you are an office guy as you can carry a charger and your desk might have a charging port
4608,4.0,but display very veek
4609,4.0,food
4610,1.0,in months only im getting issues now im not able to switch it on phone sims to be good but have lots of issues with its hardware

4612,5.0,i have really dry ends of my hair my hair length is somewhere between my waist and hips and this manages to make my ends feel amazing not to mention the smell lasts ages ive died my hair around or times in the last year including bleaching the ends and then dying them bluepurplered as well as black and brown and my hair feels as good as it did before i was dying it heaps i definitely will be buying this again and again its almost perfect for my hair
4613,5.0,good read
4614,3.0,so so
4615,2.0,bluetooth connectivity frequent interuption
4616,4.0,this dress is really really soft and comfortable its loose but still flattering i would definitely recommend it
4617,1.0,this card worked in my galaxy s right off the bat i did not need to format it or anything after about weeks i was watching a video on my phone and it locked up then the phone showed that the card was damaged now i am unable to copy anything over mb to or from the card viewing photos from the gallery also locks up the phone amazon customer service is great however they sent me a new card i will update my review after i am able to use the new one for at least a month without any errorsupdateafter having the second card for a few weeks it also had the same issues even worse the card was completely unreadable after it locked up the card showed about gb of data being used but could not be accessed via the phone or in a computer sent this one back and will be going back to my trusty gb card
4618,4.0,samsung m is really very good and worth the money i bought the phone after so much research and comparison i was very happy with the performance that i have bought the same phone for my dad as well
4619,3.0,this dress caught my eye online and i had to have it when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered beautiful vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty swishy fabric unfortunately the cut was really strange after reading several reviews i went with an xs but im not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having while everything from the waist down fit perfectly the arms were cut too tight the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up an
4620,2.0,totally disappointed too bad not reached my expectations i was expect more than real me speed performance is totally totally disappointed camera is utter flop

4623,3.0,good battery
4624,1.0,i got a used mobile
4625,4.0,receievd in time with fast amazon delivery hardy and good looking power bank with good charging speed power bank charge time hours overall a satisfactory buy
4626,4.0,i have fine and straight hair however i love the pin straight hair so for the most part my hair requires less maintenance i love using this product because its lightweight not greasy and it doesnt cause me to break out like other sprays i bought this spray because of the keratin product the coconut suntan oil smell and the price the spray releases a light mist for precise application which i enjoy the only con is because its lightweight it stays straight for the day and i would like a product with longer results i would repurchase this only because my skin is the deal breaker and it gives me a smooth and lightweight application however personally its not holy grail status and i would like to venture into other flat iron products that are not as greasy
4627,2.0,i bought this product looking for a good mousse that would keep my curly from being frizzy but not make it hard i chose this because i have already tried the coconut milk antibreakage serum and that worked wonders on my hair i really like the smell of this but it comes out sort of watery and didnt do much to prevent frizz plus the bottle leaked at the store and i had to go back and get another one but it did make my hair feel soft
4628,3.0,good speaker very bad battery life within months its not usable without plugging in
4629,2.0,i dont like my total money waste
4630,4.0,very nice simple integration with wifi parental controls would be nice but overall a great product
4631,5.0,everything is best about it the best thing i have found in this phone is we can add song while capturing video at a time night mode is simply classy this phone is beyound expectations in low price always trustworthy in quality samsung and amazon together
4632,5.0,good stuff
4633,2.0,although its good length and sturdy its quite stiff and inflexible and keeps oullingbout of the phone hardly used by t for days
4634,2.0,the product looked more or less as expected but the fabric felt very cheap not the quality i would expect from retailer the shirt is also very short which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of
4635,4.0,this dress is such a lovely thing to have in my closet its so easy to pull on but adding a nice pair of shoes a piece of jewelry and leaving my hair down reveals a gorgeous outfit that takes next to no time i must admit my local store didnt stock this dress so i wasnt quite expecting the texture of the fabric i was expecting it to be smooth but its almost ribbed its soft and comfortable though so thats certainly not a deal breaker i only wish theyd had it in petite as i feel t
4636,1.0,worst mobile i want to return but no return policy
4637,3.0,good but after months i faced problem in call speaker its sounding low need customer care number for service under warranty period
4638,2.0,have been using for over months now if it works its amazing but to be honest it lags and lags keeps buffering almost everything everytime i have clear cache or reset the device i hope amazon fixes the issue with an update or in the next release but increasing the internal memory and ram there is no much difference from the older version so of you have a k tv and planning to buying would still recommend to go for the older version because this device doesnt have screen mirroring
4639,5.0,this top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person the neckline is very high which was a surprise for a summer tank but its cut well nice surprise on seem pockets wore it today for the first time and received many comments a keeper fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top
4640,2.0,what a beautiful comfortable material and the colors are stunning im so disappointed at the unflattering cut it fits like a shapeless tent even the arm holes have big gaps that arent snug i am lbs and ordered the xxs petite
4641,5.0,go for it new apple lovers best of best
4642,4.0,this works well in my galaxy s i use it for media storage i did have to reseat it once as i kept getting an error about preparing sd card but i think that was more about how i put it in my phone than about this media i think that this is a pretty good value to extend storage on a phoneupdate i deducted a star because this card has a capacity of billion bytes but not gb there is a difference the storage is actually around gb because gb its still a very good value and i would still recommend it highly but do understand that you are not getting gb
4643,5.0,this is so pretty for summer it is very lightweight and flattering on the color was a little brighter than i expected but it is still beautiful
4644,3.0,there is a known issue with a batch of these cards where they can completely die this is known defect affecting a lot of galaxy s and note users so if your card dies either exchange through amazon or contact sandisk for a replacement newer cards are supposedly fixed but you might want to back up your data just in case mine were purchased in november and both have now failed in separate phones unreadable by pcs or phones
4645,4.0,a must read for those who want to understand and harness the power of their mind readers will get benefit if they seriously start practising therapies which are suitable for them
4646,3.0,its okay its a computer
4647,3.0,little hanging problam
4648,4.0,i was drawn to this top due to its unique detailing and soft casual cotton feel i wear a nude bra underneath with no problem im c and the small hits right at my hips so its not to short or too long i often wear an xs in tops and i didnt even try on the xs in this one because i felt the small fit just right with the cutout detailing ill hand wash this i hope it holds up
4649,1.0,whenever i am charging my mobile with this power bank its quickly gets charge bt the worst part is its not even month that i purchased i dont what is the problem unable to charge my mobile and power bank is also not getting charge soon
4650,5.0,couldnt have got a product better works great
4651,1.0,color os experience is very poor not liking this os experience realms u is average device iam not liking the its user interface definitely i will not recommend this device because of color os which is pathetic os
4652,2.0,not even months the screen got cracked and only half of it is working so anyone help me for return or repair
4653,3.0,barely use
4654,4.0,this review is after using days i got delivery in days i have gb rom gb ram version with mah battery pros battery battery backup is very good with gaming hour backup video play same around to hour only call msgwhats app more than hours so it is overall very good touch it is very nice you can play game like call of dutypubg and need speed like game very smoothly i love for this finger scanner it is good work great face scaner some time it does not work camera video recordings and its features are good slow motion and super slow motion pictures are avg to get best you have to dip dig into settings cons camera not satisfied with camera pics quality is not so good
4655,1.0,after checking so many reviews i bought it pros ok sound cons uncomfortable thin wires hate the whole thing overall i dont recommend this product
4656,3.0,reasonable price
4657,4.0,no call recording and fingerprint scanner is slow little bitits good but not great

4659,2.0,the product was damged due to dent on the refrigerator body
4660,5.0,love the quality of the sandisk ultra class card it will be very valuable for storage on my samsung galaxy tab sam
4661,1.0,im really surprised that so many people like this conditioner i have long straight hair with a bit of dryness but no frizz i purchased this because ive been trying to use more natural products and i love anything with tea tree oil i really wanted to like this brand but unfortunately this product didnt deliver for me while it did an okay job of detangling my hair when in the shower i was left with constant tangles for the rest of the day i cant believe that didnt bother anyone else i couldnt even run my fingers through my hair also i noticed that my hair was full of static and its august i cant imagine what would happen if i used this in the winter my hair was really limp and even the color looked more dull lastly the tea tree oil smell was weakened by an ubersweet vanilla note that sort of ruined the usual greener smell of the tea tree if the conditioner worked then i would be able to handle the smell but it was definitely not worth it for me im a stickler for using a product until its gone but i think i might have to ditch this one honestly youd be better off buying a cent bottle of suave
4662,2.0,i liked the smell of this lotion but it didnt moisturize enough for my taste i felt like i had to moisturize again like one hour later also theres glitter in it even if they dont advertise it anywhere on the bottle so its good to know do not purchase this lotion if you hate glitter in your lotion the packaging is super pretty tho i will not repurchase but it wasnt a bad lotion just not for me
4663,5.0,good phone delay to deliver
4664,2.0,looks like a pregnancy top a lot gathers in front and back added pounds to me not flattering on much longer than on the model and the color is not white its white with a weird tan taupe stripe i returned it same day i received it which was disappointing
4665,5.0,i love this dress and received many compliments when i wore it the pink is beautiful however it does run large so i will need to exchange it the little square at the base of the neckline was crooked on the one i received might not bug anyone else but it bothered me
4666,2.0,i had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top i get the style but if it adds lbs to your middle area its not for me it is a thin material so it does hang nice
4667,3.0,the older macbook airnon retina had an abundance of ports including an sd card slot a thunderbolt port two usba ports a headphone jack and the magsafewattconnector for charging the macbook air retina editionjust has two thunderbolt ports and a headphone jackit also has a w usbc power adapterand you get a usbc to usbc charging cable i know nobody would like to spend extra for the thunderbolt cable i used to find the sd card slot useful for extending the memory on the older macbook air

4670,2.0,bought this card for my galaxy s and after installing it and loading my music the card was randomly ejecting itself after like the rd ejection of the morning the phone reported that the card needed to be reformatted because it was damaged so i reformatted the random sdcard ejection and damaged card kept coming up after googling i read that the galaxy series phones are known to have compatibility issues with sandisk cards and its a hit or miss some phones have no issues i have replaced this card already which amazon shipped me a nd card within a few days but the same problems arise not sure if i should switch to a different brand but this card is definitely useless to me for the time being maybe i can give it away to a friend who doesnt have an s
4671,2.0,average bass quality medium noise cancellationwhen you listen music or watch videos unwanted noises from the wire itself comes and irritate youif the wire comes in contact with anything it produces noise which is not normally seen in earphones like samsung nokia
4672,3.0,loved this jumper i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer with jumpers its mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach so thought this one would probably be a medium but it was definitely baggylose otherwise i wouldve totally kept it
4673,2.0,not ok with gopro hero black edition the speed of this card is below other brands class standard when i use this card with gopro and protune on it will stop recording after mins or so i already returned this item and bought the samsung class memory card instead

4679,3.0,nothing exciting
4680,3.0,i really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly cant now i was attracted to the softness simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it wrinkles pills and loses shape quickly if you still want to get it consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size the styling is excellentvery versatile but the yarn is too delicate and fussy
4681,4.0,i love this shampoo i have tried several sulfate free shampoos and they just didnt leave my hair as soft as this shampoo does not only does it smell great but it leaves my hair so soft and does not strip my haircolor i also heard that shampoos with sulfates can cause acne so that is why i decided to go with sulfatefree shampoos no more acne i am really happy with this shampoo i will try the other organix shampoos they all seem to smell really good oh the other thing i noticed with this shampoo is that i dont loose as much hair with other shampoos there was a lot of hair that would fall off in the shower not with this shampoo i was surprised that i did not see any hair on the floor
4682,5.0,charging is very slow dont know is it the charger problem or does it have the default charging system as slow kindly give me some number to whom i should contact
4683,2.0,i usually like coats and wraps with highwaisted belts but this way too high and the fit was really unflattering i can see it being chic on a tall slender person but its definitely not right for my short curvy body returning it today

4687,3.0,working fine how i had went for higher capacityas per requirement product is good charge stays for long
4688,5.0,bought this back during an retailer event because i was in the market something long oversized to wear over leggings so when i saw this i thought it could fit the bill i read the reviews knew it was more of a soft tshirtlike fabric and is short when belted so because im i was sold i bought the xl because i have wide shoulders a dd chest size when i got it home i was in love rich garnet so soft comfy then i tried buttoning it it was just a bit too small pul

4701,4.0,i have another paper crown dress that is a favorite this dress has the same quality and i love the print which is somewhere between abstract and almost animal unfortunately the fit did not work for me i am largebusted and need a bra this dress cuts in at the shoulders and did not work with any of my bras except strapless also the waist cinches but without a defined band this looked a bit more frumpy again i suspect the fault is in my figure not the dress for someone with a smaller
4702,5.0,best phone its quite remarkable how smooth and easy this phone operates ive used it for now more than a month and still no lag no performance issues now i have become use to of the gestures by oneplus be it the camera department the smoothness the speed and performance of course the hz display is a real thing and you know what you will feel major difference when using other devices a bit improvement is needed in battery department but oneplus has covered it by giving fast charging which is blazing fast however you can easily run this phone for one whole day if you are a moderate user say hrs of watching videos answering calls taking photos etc i am very satisfied with the product moreover ive purchased the gb variant which at that time was of got instant discount and exchanged my old phone for and got it at no cost emi so it was nice deal
4703,3.0,this top is very pretty but it fits funny its boxy and doesnt hang well i feel like you could almost wear it as a ndtrimesterpregnancyblouse i tried the small the small petite they both fit the same too big and too boxy but the petite was shorter i am lbs b i preferred the regular length but if you like your tops to end at your waistband then the petite would fit too i still really like the top so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale

4706,3.0,the material was a little itchy in my opinion the fit was pretty big almost a night shirt im and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights i got a small i purchased the orange color online stay away if you have an olive skin tone its the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website im pounds d
4707,4.0,i got the package mi tape unsealed but the normal taping was done so i am suspecting it was a returned piece leaving that fact it has good picture quality and overall build is ok being an android tv it dont have all basic apps like netflix prime and voot etc on play store which is strange but can be sideloadedinstalled from usb the software still have glitches but updates might sort it later screen mirroring is little complicated but i havent got my s mirrored yettried all ways no doubt it is a good tv but has few defects which can be cured by coming updates let me say it again picture quality is good for which i was confused earlier
4708,5.0,just loved it timely delivered by amazon

4722,4.0,same as my review for shampoo first time organix user i spent a lot of time wondering about this product i read a lot of reviews and finally bought as it was on sale at my local superstore along with the shampoo id heard reviews of people noticing less hair loss and i noticed it too with the previous shampooconditioner combo i was using i experienced a fair amount of hair lossbreakage now next to none the scent is nice im in love with a lot of stuff coconut and its not overpowering i actually use the coconut water hydration oil if i want a little burst of scent i also love how much more nourished and stronger my hair seems my biggest flaws are the price anywhere from depending where i go and if its on sale and the fact that the bottles dont show how much is left if i have the money id definitely repurchase i love how my hair feels afterwards
4723,2.0,the battery life of an iphone is really bad if you need a long battery life stick to an android phone also the camera is not that great either what a ripoff
4724,2.0,remote quality very bad not work high prices remote my opinion remote price more than only
4725,2.0,quality of printed material is not good as compare to price u can easily purchase this type of printed material in local market under
4726,3.0,it looks great on the model but not on me on me it looked more like a sack of potatoes the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion it is very thick ill be returning it because it is not flattering on me
4727,5.0,the material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back so it is so comfortable i agree with the previous review i am not thrilled about the hook and eye but it still looks cute with a tank under it i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white it looks great with skinny jeans or pants
4728,5.0,superb smartphone by samsung samsung come back in market with good specifications with reasonable price
4729,3.0,hd channels are stacking in the middle
4730,3.0,i love the pattern and style of this top it is a flattering cut however it was way too short i am and small usually fits me without issue sadly enough i had to return it

4732,4.0,good this pri
4733,3.0,customers beware there is no lining on this dress i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress i ordered it on line but ill take it back to the shop
4734,5.0,its a good device i would say its flagship mobile perfect price for such a bigger screen and smooth touch and another noticeable feature is the camera its a trio cam device perfectly synced each one for one purpose and with wide angle and live focus and pro manual camera its such a great device and i would recommend if you are looking for a better device with a medium price
4735,1.0,worst customer service on mi tv c pro i brought days before but not yet installed
4736,1.0,baddest mobile in the world
4737,3.0,i love these shorts very pretty and well made but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs beware not as flattering as on the model adn probably previous reviewer shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg creating a weird tent effect around the area waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on skinny legs
4738,3.0,this top was so pretty online unfortunately it did not work for me the front was a bit more shapeless in person though the back was gorgeous with a button gather at center the color appeared yellow online but was a bit more green in person also the armholes were very low so it would need a camisole or no bra
4739,1.0,useless because they are not provide the basic accessories with this mobile like headphone
4740,2.0,why mi products have some problems always call notification is show but rejection is not work green light always automatic blinking without continue heart rate function on battery is draining very fast as charged to steps counter is very slow i have huawei honor band its is better than mi band for quality and accuracy
4741,5.0,performance on this device is the best according to its price also you dont see a lot of hz or hz screens in this price range hz display gives an extra smoothness than standard hz screens just go for it if you have budget around k
4742,3.0,this top is really cute online but thats about it it runs large but even if i sized down the ruffles were a bit much and the top was a little boxy surprisingly
4743,5.0,love this
4744,1.0,shinco tv is a challenge when it comes to usability remote is very difficult to use and understanding between remote and tv is very primitive like remotes of s coming to remote quality i have changed remotes in months whereas my other remotes work for years in second remote which was delivered the mouse pointer does not work at all really frustrated oct shinco promised months ago to replace mother board nothing done till now
4745,3.0,ordered this in white thought would be really cute but didnt like and returned it i am big busted and it was unflattering teh way it draped
4746,2.0,phone is very good and good performancebut expected bluetooth headsets device bcz no port for wired headset disappointed with this
4747,5.0,good clarity
4748,2.0,had to return this for a couple of reasons was too small its made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand i didnt bother to order a size up because i wasnt sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large the main color isnt grey like the picture its a black and white checkered pattern so it doesnt look at all grey irl im still recommending because if you get the right size and like the colors it will be a nice light and comfy swea
4749,1.0,the print and front ruffle are beautiful the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model its almost like the sleeves have a life of their own so mismatched with this style of blouse such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape
4750,4.0,this is only one day review powerbank was good enough i can charge my mi note pro for two times by this delivery was within days of order and packing was also nice
4751,3.0,this is a pretty dress i bought a size and the body of the dress fit however the sleeves were too long had to return as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me
4752,4.0,everything is ok only sound volume is little less and also youtube not working which is there in google home
4753,4.0,till now the product is good in usage the screen is really big and the voices quality is really impressive the battery lasts for whole day and the picture quality is superb the only issue is memory as its only gb but its expandable as memory card shot is available

4756,3.0,super cute top thin would look great layered not crazy how it looked by itself

4758,5.0,several months ago i bought the byron lars pieced brocade dress size its a little large through the torso area but with the belt it fits good enough since i have loved this dress so much i wanted another byron lars dress so i bought the carissima sheath and the sunrose dress both in a they both were way too big so i ordered a size and they both just barely fit oh was i disappointedso one more try i ordered this dress the allusione sheath size and yepeee it fits perfect

4760,4.0,this phone is good at its price range fingerprint reader is quick and accuratecamera and battery is average
4761,4.0,nice product sound quality is good easy to carry anywhere coz of the small size but if u listen to songs whole day then u have to charge it times for me its best
4762,2.0,i love the color of this dress it is not flattering even though it should be the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky the lace is heavy but the silky panels arent so not flattering its just odd and the fit is super huge you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape it could have been so cute but was executed so poorly
4763,4.0,these pants fit great true to size heavy enough to withstand winter and the knees dont stretch out as some pants are prone to experiencing the one problem is that the zipper is exposed on the inside of the pants so it tends to rub against my upper leg and can be quite uncomfortable its nothing wearing a pair of spanx couldnt take care of so ive kept them despite this design flaw
4764,5.0,i love this thing i bought it primarily as a smart alarm clock it lives on my night stand and is so amazingly capable i cant believe they sell it for with everything it currently does and new skills being added all the time its one of my favorite things ever
4765,3.0,i ordered these with high hopes i have other pairs of joggers by a different brand that i adore i was disappointed the fabric isnt soft as i expected the pants pucker out strangely under the waist band but this might be due to folding while packaged i tried these on several times wanting to like them but just couldnt i am returning them the colors are beautiful especially the bands on the bottom they seem made well it might just be that i am between sizes i am i tri
4766,3.0,kevin tv is good only but i have problem with connecting mirror casting its showing timeout everytime and for installation no one has called yet poor service i dont know how long they gonna a make me wait
4767,3.0,i have bought jbl flip a year ago there was a battery problem and i gave it for repair under warranty it has been months and they are saying stories and no update on my product please think many times before buying a jbl product sound everything is fine but compared to sennheiser customer support jbl is nothing
4768,2.0,my vshape figure broad shoulder narrow hips waist not well defined looked completely square in this not flattering at all perhaps better for other figures
4769,2.0,battery life is main concern and heating problem also existing my recommendation is not to go with this product
4771,1.0,very poor and non user friendly functions multiple good options are not available in this phone during video running brightness and sound can not be adjusted on screen left and right side option not available slow response sometimes give feeling like year old phone poor battery performance doesnt separate messages from your contacts and other service providers multiple messages can not be read as marked as read option not available which is common option in low cost phone also phone hang issue with in week after phone purchase low brightness while video running etc etc

4781,3.0,features options of the mobile is ok but the display screen is not strong and durable screen got scratches easily and broken
4782,2.0,no voice recognition its not a real android tv half of the apps are age old tv has too much colors and not enough controls to set it too bright for eyes wifi reception is not good they should have given a fhd tv instead which could be converted to android tv using chromecast or amazon stick sound quality is cheap verdict tv is not that smart
4783,5.0,so nice to switch it up from all my black and gray sweats these are luxuriously soft and so so comfortable they are light weight and beautiful i am and i am very happy with the size xs i purchased was deciding between xs and s and i am happy i went with the xs worth every penny you wont regret also finally perfect length
4784,1.0,i have never written a review before and i love retailer and shop here often however i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money it is such poor quality it looks thick and flows in the photo it is very thin and it itches so bad i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail i will deff be taking it back and do not recommend it at all

4787,1.0,i bought these on sale and they quickly went back i was very disappointed after reading the reviews i thought for sure these would be a winner however i was sadly mistaken i ordered another pair of jeans the same from a different brand these were way too small while my others were too large they didnt live up to my expectation and were still rather long even though i bought these on sale i was not happy with the quality
4788,5.0,i like the way of writing

4810,4.0,well its working well good to mi make low price good phone
4811,2.0,these socks were so narrow especially on top that they pinched my thighs and were almost painful to wear all day my thighs are pretty narrow im only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they dont slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny one size is definitely not true they also snag easily
4812,5.0,only a single word god max picture quality is so crisp sound quality is damn good connectivity is fine takes very less time to boot up no lags just go for it if your looking for mid range smart tv
4813,2.0,i was attracted to the feminine design of the dress the silhouette the flouncy skirt however i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy dark colors
4814,5.0,simply put it is a gb microsdhc card that came in the mail when it said it would it was empty when i got it it works as expected it holds files images etc and it has the adapter included voila
4815,3.0,it is too early to give an honest review the echo dot is in a room not close to our echo but i will soon be using it more often when colder weather sets in then i will be able to give an honest review
4816,2.0,its a let down i purchased shinco based on internet reviews but it lacks lots of basic features cons it does not support voice search it does not support play store it hangs when i play k content via youtube only way to restore is power cycle its display adjustment settings are poor brightness not comfortable to eyes cannot adjust display settings when in smart mode tried for refund within given day timeline but amazon cheaters denied henceforth will keep away from amazon guys do not waste your hard earned money on amazon buy via store showroom etc first have look at its features yourself then only buy
4817,4.0,first i must say that this dress fits beautifully in my usual xs lbs and the geometric pattern is adorable i often have a fit problem with dresses i think due to a long waist where the fabric bunches up by my lower back not so with this dress it shows off my curves without being super tight and the fabric has a little stretch so the dress isnt binding for my age however mids this dress is just a little too short for the office so im sending it back also i felt that
4818,1.0,i was very excited to get the dot it worked great for a few days now its not working at all and its not even been days makes me sad it was a th anniversary gift
4819,5.0,sandisk ultra gb microsdhc class uhs item is as described decent product for its price and quality it comes with the small sd card and a next size up adapter
4820,1.0,what sold me on this shampoo was the scent its amazinggg then i actually tried it it was horrible so incredibly drying my hair felt like straw i found the consistency of the shampoo very strange almost lumpy and goopy my friend has oily hair and it works wonders for her but i have normaldry hair so this was a complete nightmare i gave them away

4827,5.0,budget phone with great features
4828,3.0,these are absolutely beautiful pants soft and wearable right away but the other reviewer is right if you are average or short these will be way too long they wont even look like cropped pants just regular wide leg jeans i am keeping them bc i love the look and i will also have them altered to be shorter its disappointing that these were designed for the statuesque instead of the other of us especially considering the amazingly high price for a pair of jeans so i guess i am di

4833,3.0,i expected to love this since i usually look good in this style of jacket its definitely comfortable and the fit was fine but i really dont care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just meh its going back unfortunately
4834,3.0,it is not as good as the echo from time to time is fails to react also its connection with wifi needs to improve i wish i bought the echo instead
4835,1.0,dont waste your money if you have another of these devices already you can only listen to music on one device at a time with the same account of course there was no warning about that when purchasing its less useful than a hockey puck
4836,4.0,i like the product for that money
4837,2.0,i ended up using this product as a foam to reset my curls the scent of this product is nice but i could of have done the same thing with a spray bottle of water this product had very little hold factor for me as a hair moussethis is more of a product for someone who prob doesnt need a high factor of hold or doesnt like that heavy hair product feel in thier hair
4838,1.0,laptop is not getting on so please replace it with new one regards j p james
4839,1.0,it requires wifi connection and its impossible to get wifi connection everytime it only understand englishus because alexa cannot understand simple english and hindi too

4841,5.0,this is a bit pricey but its the most beautiful sweater that i own it fits beautifully and the material is soft not itchy which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck the cowl sits beautifully no matter how you fold it and the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright and is just lovely i ordered a small and it covers my butt which is perfect for leggings or even with tights and boots its not shapeless but seems to graze your thighs and has a mild tur
4842,1.0,my band lasted for days i doubt whether the product is defective or is it normal as the company claims for days or better it not even lasted for a week please look into the problem xiaomi sunlight visibility is very very poor in direct sunlight its just impossible to view details on screen this is a fitness band which is used outdoor most of the time hope xiaomi can make this happen via a firmware update or replace with more brighter display
4843,4.0,looking awesome screen quilty nice not perfect but best in this budget sound quilty is poor thats the negatives point over all good product in k
4844,3.0,does not search as intended plays music that suits alexa in short alexa is the master and we the slaves
4845,2.0,its like a work of art but sadly not flattering on me i absolutely loved the look and even considered taking it to a tailor but the material overall is very stiff if youre teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips you might love it very sad to return this
4846,5.0,i love this stuff it works so well and thats all i can really say i use a small amount that i mainly use on the ends of my hair and its so soft now i recieve compliments from friends and family all of the time who also say it smells great i would strongly reccommend this product
4847,3.0,sometimes it works sometimes not isrote thst before because when i got home alexa would not obey i dont know what i am doing when it lights up then makes a little ding turns off
4848,2.0,when i double touch on screen light is on what is this make
4849,3.0,worked fine for the first day from second day onwards the phone stopped charging and i had to reboot the phone for it to charge and the same would happen after minutes tried other phones and the problem persists had to return due to this
4850,3.0,this runs small i got the size which fits like a medium not a large its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy i loved the elbow length sleeves i have a large g bust and although this fit it came to the top of my waist and im shortwaisted its a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length
4851,1.0,what you see above is my iphone x previously i have used many other iphones including se and all but this one oh my god this one is giving me so much headache it started before months when my iphone freezed for a period of minutes and i was not even able to restart the device and after some times it resumed the activity before a few days the d touch was not functioning well and after talking with the adviser from apple i restarted the network settings and the d touch problem was solved but at night the problem resumed today one side of the phone suddenly changed its color by about am and the whole screen is glitching on its own i had so much of faith in you iphone x as i was a fan boy i didnt mind about the freezing because glitches are usual and now one of the costliest phone is malfunctioning by a lot i dont know what to say speechless
4852,4.0,a little thin but overall very cute i like it with waist high skirts
4853,4.0,it is very nice mobile its camera is sound battery life front camera value of money display
4854,4.0,nice buy value for money
4855,2.0,not worth the cost
4856,4.0,i ordered my typical petite and found that the buttons were pulling at the bust im b and at the waist im returning and ordering a size petite because im a sucker for a shirtdress and a cute novelty print the quality is nice and the length was perfect for my short frame now only to wait for it to be shipped oh how i wish petites were available in my local store
4857,2.0,i really loved this skirt on the model but it just wasnt flattering when i received my order i ordered two sizes and i am athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to sadly i had to return both perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame
4858,5.0,best features at best pricesmart purchase
4859,2.0,ive previously used the coconut organix and should have learned my lesson while these products promise a lot and they do smell great and have cute packaging they just dont deliver the shea butter products seemed okay at first after shampooing my hair was extremely tangled and felt stripped but after the conditioner it felt silky and soft i didnt notice any particular quotsmoothingquot ability though after about weeks use my hair was dried out with frizz and i gave these to my husband to finish them up my hair tends to be somewhat dry and i only wash about twice a week these might be okay if you have oily hair and only wash once a week but if your hair is at all dry or has any damage avoid the shampoo strips your hair and the conditioner isnt hydrating enough to recover it wont repurchase
4860,1.0,my phone is only days old and it hangs a lot touch doesnt work properly many a time when i call someone or receive a call the disconnect button and call receive button doesnt work didnt like the phone unhappy with the purchase cannot even return since the return window is closed really disappointed
4861,1.0,bought this tv with exchange i was happy until its fragile max portion of the screen got damaged with the light indirect hit with the remote in the past i accidentally hit my years old sony lcd and another year old sony led but nothing happened so what is so different in this kavin tv of course the thin and cheap lcd panel to save the cost and new led panel is costing of the value of the tv funny i am sure now that i will never buy nonbranded electronic items
4862,2.0,bad phone
4863,5.0,this is the perfect summer dress it can be dressed up or down the quality of the linen fabric is very nice im and it hit right below my knees i found it to run true to size those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size but the tie in the front can be adjusted its lovely
4864,2.0,the top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy it also feels cheap to the touch i love the idea but cant keep it for this priceim a shorty so id have to hem it too sadly will return
4865,5.0,nice one in this price range
4866,2.0,is not a place i want to be even if the style of a sweater is great yes this sweater is very cropped but i think itamps definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit itamps the itchiness that makes it an immediate ampquotnoampquot and thatamps coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance
4867,3.0,the charging cable input has not been working well now it gas completely stopped working since the phone is on warrantee period kindly replace it thanks in advance
4868,3.0,this is such a cute design but its so short it barely hits at my hips youd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed im also not thrilled with the buttons i am a c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size top i wish theyd been sewn shut the neckline is so big its not like the buttons need to function i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great too bad its so short and gapes open at the bust going back
4869,4.0,i agree with other reviews soft cozy and love the embroidery and beading it is a bit wrinkly even after i ironed it but overall happy with this blouse
4870,1.0,fitbit stopped working and there is no support for warranty i purchased this from amazon on the th feb worked only for around days and now its not charging as of today the site is down and customer care support no isnt available so my purchase of is a complete loss my advice to all first get in touch with support and then buy the product
4871,5.0,love my echo love alexa finding the music i want and telling me the time i dont even use all her talents yet but love it
4872,4.0,i tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room i was pleasantly surprised by this piece the color is beautiful not too yellow not too brown i have not worn it yet so im assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model perhaps thats why i dont need a cami underneath
4873,3.0,the fabric was more southwestern looking when i got it than it looked in the pics it fit a bit larger around the bottom than i like
4874,5.0,i tried both the xs and s in the store i am usually an xs but ended up buying the s because the xs was really short and i didnt want it to be any shorter after washing the s fit more like a normal tshirt although the back is longer love the color blue and the fabric is super soft also happy that its not too thin nor seethrough
4875,3.0,battery life is good else its just an another apple

4881,2.0,i was so excited to order this dress had the perfect red shoes to go with it unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small i am lb and it was like a maternity dress sad to send it back
4882,4.0,i just got this shirt the other day at the store to my surprise i needed a size zero i usually wear a size or small never that small i am and a dd and it was still a little loose i bought the blue and brown color combination it looked really cute on with a pair of white jeans for summer
4883,1.0,worse experience with this offer session i wanted to exchange my old phone with iphone but my give pin code is not serviceable it seems then i gave city center address still the same error i have selected option to collect from showroom by that time that product was out of stock and after few minutes same drama started i just hate it
4884,3.0,its said keyboard remote air mouse will be given but it doesnt have it missing mirror cast doesnt works
4885,5.0,this tunic is a lighter weight knit that isnt bulky to wear under coats etc it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth it has a flattering fit i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front it adds more interest to the look
4886,5.0,good product value of the money awesome performance really nice
4887,4.0,so i bought this phone after reading and watching many reviews on numerous websites and youtube overall phone is pretty smooth no lag good performance you can play pubg and it will run okayishly till medium graphic settings and then its bound to lag talking about the camera low light and performance in artifical lighting in not as good as i expected you lose a lot of details the major concern that i have with this phone that in pro camera mode there is no way to control the shutter speed and you can only increase the iso to the value of and you cant even adjust the focus of the camera through stock camera app but you can use the open camera app to adjust focus manually after enabling the cameraapi in open cameras setting rest all is good display is super amoled which is great and the battery runs for about and a half day almosi giving screen on time of about hours
4888,5.0,it has been a amazing experience using samsung galaxy m for months good performance for a price like this amazing battery life best for millennials also taken good quality pictures one of the best thing is about the wide angle lens
4889,5.0,i am giving this item a five star rating because it works well and can be used in a micro or standard format
4890,5.0,this device is working as expected but i got to know that even my sony tv remote can do almost all the things like scroll volume change etc not sure about other tv models
4891,2.0,the color is as pictured good quality its lined the zipper in the back makes it look updated i ordered my usual size small petite size it fit perfectly im feet and lbs hourglass figure i had high hopes i have hips and short heavy legs the skirt only emphasized my flaws if youve got great legs you will do well with this i do own other short skirts but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal if youre on the fence give it a try it
4892,1.0,i usually love tops like this i bought this is the store because if was so soft got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at allwould be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in
4893,3.0,i suggest not to buy this tv though it is good but there are no service center as mentioned the toll free number is useless as it is not working when my tv was not working with in months incould not get it repaired under warrenty because of lack of service center i had to pay to get it repaired from other parties songo for standard television models instaed of such cheap ones though cost may be more there is standard warranty and service available
4894,5.0,i am very happy about the jacket i like the material and the cut i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day about f with a thin sweater underneath and it felt comfortable the fit is very flattering i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer lb got size s also i wish the lining was full not just the front detail it would allow more versatility but thats just me overall i like it
4895,3.0,phone seems to have some sort of compatibility issues with apps so it restarts automatically and had occasions where calling experience were not so good making and features of phone are awesome but doesnt fullfill the purpose
4896,3.0,i have purchased dslr on th aug worth rs on that time cash back on said purchase was mentioned which was to be credited in my account after three months but same has not been credited so far kindly resolve my problem
4897,1.0,got pirated copy as there was no hologram and quality of print and pages also bad so returned it
4898,2.0,i loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly it makes me look like a football player i am athletic build and i was swimming in the m i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads it hangs and gaps awkwardly the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short
4899,5.0,woooow great love u mi
4900,5.0,this is so cool music any time very surprise on the speakers power overall wonderfull
4901,1.0,the phone camera really sucks i ordered this phone because of its camera quality only but who knows ordering this is gonna be the worst decision

4905,5.0,this model is very good excellent elegant look
4906,5.0,i love these pants purchased them in white the fit is great the fabric is just the right thickness given they are white i dont want the fabric to be too thin a bit long so i will have to have them tailored but vey happy with these pants
4907,2.0,very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent like and it looks like a maternity top on me i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes sadly i sent it back
4908,3.0,the details on this dress are lovely the embroidery is wonderful but the fit on this dress is just not for me it is very baggy and shapeless it doesnt have any curves at all so it just drapes down me and looks formless really unflattering sad but its going back
4909,2.0,i have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love everything about them this jumper looked versatile useful and fun so i splurged during the off dress sale my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true or european and thus small i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless it looked horrible from every angle front back and sides i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size the fabric is nice p

4912,1.0,very poor camera detailing battery is not that much as expected from mah processor is not that powerful for gaming and even for selecting more than pic in whats app it struggles and get slower build quality is poor plastic body front camera is very very bad if u zoom in then one can understand the poor detailing quality same for back camera rival phones gives better camera quality and detailing clarity battery is ok for one day use which is not that good as mah of redmi also did the same processor is poor if u play games it gets heated and freezes gb ram and gb still its under performance display is the only one thing that is good no good glass protection is provided not at all satisfied with this product please give update at least for camera we r suffering a lot
4913,4.0,i normally wear an xl but could only find this instore in size large the blouse fits nicely but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size the blouse itself has a nice drape to it the black railroad tracks look very pretty in person and add a nice detail the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl
4914,4.0,i bought the xs and the fit was good ill probably add a snap at the bust area because the slip underneath does show like a camisole which is fine but i prefer it closed also ill add a belt to cinch my waist booties and maybe a hat

4916,5.0,great gaming laptop at this price range verified that all specs are as per the seller discription

4936,2.0,i wanted to like this hair butter since my hair loves thick buttery leave ins but unfortunately this one didnt do it for me it goes on smooth upon applying smells delicious and seems to moisturize but it literally feels like i just spread water on my hair with the speed that my hair sucks up the moisture im talking i apply this butter and the moment ive moved on to another section my hair feels like i never applied any moisture in the first place this would probably be better for hair types that dont need heavier moisture but unfortunately for me it didnt work

4956,3.0,this is the best self help book any entrepreneur could ever read perhaps the only one they need to truly transformative napoleon hill was tasked by andrew carnegie to write a book on what made a successful person succeed and he spent years researching and interviewing great name of the day ford woolworth edison etc plus lots of people who failed because you have to know what doesnt work too this book is the result it basically hammers home a single point over and over again success comes from knowing what you want to achieve and having a burning desire to achieve it the starting point of all achievements is desire keep ths constantly in mind weak desire brings weak results just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat

4968,4.0,doesnt always recognize voice good for music cat sounds weather
4969,2.0,this blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and cant be saved the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesnt lay right underneath the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print definitely not worth the money even at off plus
4970,3.0,i bought this because i love the smell of coconuts and i needed a new body washbar i was previously using dove bars but i like to try new things when i finish what i was currently using i ordered this from amazon for about dollars and when it finally came in the mail i was so excited to try it the smell is slightly coconut but its overpowered by the smell of the sugarcane which isnt necessarily a bad thing but i really wanted a strong sweet coconut smell for the summer the body wash doesnt really lather which i dont like because i feel as though i have to use more of it to feel clean i use exfoliating gloves and they can create a lot of lather even if i dont use a lot of product i dont feel as though its made my skin any softer but i will continue using it until i finish the bottle
4971,2.0,have a net
4972,2.0,its not a bad concept but i wished for more i wish this tunic was a different material as it was wrinkley and dropwaist design instead of at the waist too bad i wanted to love it but it will go back
4973,3.0,the dress is adorable and has a very nice fabric and a slip that goes underneath it was just too big for me even as a swing dress
4974,1.0,seems like used one not satisfied
4975,2.0,way too much fabric sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip eek might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric but the extra fabric just piles up on itself the outer layer also doesnt feel like it will breath add the cotton lining and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer returning

5012,3.0,i just loved this when i saw it in store beautiful fabric lovely color i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs it might end up looking like a witches coat at least that is what i was told by my daughter
5013,2.0,cute in theory i love the bright colors the tied black collar sash and the s vibe however the fabric is cheap and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern maybe this was intentional but with the shirt i received it looked horrible i sent it back i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam so it is a bit deceiving i wouldnt buy this top at any price based on
5014,2.0,for a couple weeks i debated making this purchase in fear that my size would no longer be available i ordered this lovely top when it arrived i was immediately disappointed with its colorsunlike the vibrant colors in the photo the tops colors were dullmore a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender had the fit been better i would have kept this item despite of its color its cut weird though it runs slightly large i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and

5018,2.0,bluetooth connection is poor with my phone
5019,2.0,i am writing this after using the phone for several days the gb ram model is not really very fast battery life is also average the biggest problem is that the phone comes with too much advertisement every time you unlock it you will have to navigate through whole lot of ads before you find your app this was not my experience with previous motorola and redmi note phones only thing i found good is display even the much touted camera is only average consider to note pro considering the quantum of add they sent to me every day the phone should priced around k only i am totally disappointed with this purchase if you gone through any review on you tube like myself you will not find this kind of remark as they are doing only paid promotion only so please think twice before buying it redminote pro is better and cheaper than this as i saw the same with my friend

5030,3.0,frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy and it has an attached camisole but the sheerness of the top still showed my nudecolored bra strap so i dont even know what to wear under it its going back even with the sale price

5036,3.0,i was really pulling for this dress to work because its beautiful however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return its much higher on the model than in real life the petite length was still far too long so additional hemming required otherwise fit was true to size lbs size p

5038,1.0,go with lg and samsung
5039,2.0,this really was nothing special for there are much cuter tops at retailer it wasnt particularly flattering as it was very boxy so it added volume it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big overall this was just a miss for me
5040,5.0,easy to carry led light indicator easily displays whether its charging properly or not affordable price but the usb connector is problematic it doesnt get easily attached to mobile or other devices it needs a lot of pressure to be pulled out of the devices
5041,3.0,a decent phone for that price
5042,4.0,i picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart things i really like about this skirt are that its basic black but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer and its stretchy the yogapantwaistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit depending on whetherhow much you fold it down it is lined which is a big plus i was
5043,4.0,this vest is beautiful and exactly as shown in the model shot it is soft warm and drapes beautifullyperfect length on my frame the leather detail along the edge is a nice highquality touch i will say that it is pretty itchy especially around the neck but wearing a shirt with a collar like it is shown seems to help that issue the dark color is navy in the print not blackoverall i think this is gorgeous but the full price feels a little ludicrousi think i may wait until sa
5044,4.0,can it works on that our local voltage
5045,2.0,i ordered this since it looked so cute on the model when i it arrived i was excited to try it on but when i didblah the color is murky and the top runs large not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top plus its lined i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit in the end i decided that it wasnt worth it too bad as the concept was a good one it just failed in the execution
5046,3.0,this phone gets p fps video recording me laughs in k fps
5047,1.0,very bad experience with expensive electronic purchased on amazon
5048,4.0,i like it for what it does
5049,1.0,product dimension not according to description not satisfied
5050,2.0,maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers usually fall in love with a blouse only to look at the tag and discover its by maeve go figure this top is just atrocious though does nothing for girls with a larger chest very boxy and unflattering gorgeous colors though and the sleeve concept is cute however where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on not impressed
5051,1.0,thought this would be a great dress for warm days but alas it fit like a sack love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses shame this did nothing for my curves ordered an usually wear a and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders if you can sport a loose swingy shape this is a great dress with nice detailing but sadly the shape did not work for me

5056,1.0,its just a month i had purchased this and im facing lots of problems like heating and soundissues
5057,1.0,the last prime festival and the reviews coaxed us into buying the inch model delivered after days and installation appointment fixed after days from purchase we were told not to open the package as this could void the guarantee the friendly service personnel turns up punctually opens the package mounts the tv onto the wall only to find that the tv is broken he raises a replacement request so far everything good and now comes the hard part amazon defers the complaint to kevin who defers it back to amazon in what seems to be a ball game in fact we could reach kevin only once now we stand as foolish customers as bait to the low prices with no support from amazon or kevin may be we are the unlucky lot which fall into the far end of the guassian curve but this review is exactly to bring this group into light to those that might fall into the category of star or nostar reviews the low price comes at a risk and we stand testimony to that

5071,4.0,satisfied
5072,2.0,this was disappointing to me i love how this looks on the model unfortunately it made me look huge it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on i didnt find it was tts i am a m and got the m it was too tight in the waist before id even put it on i noticed the waist looked very small i dont even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching its like the buttons didnt match up or something

5077,2.0,this top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag with only a quick ironing unfortunately the first time i washed it cold water hang dry it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy is much shorter and feels rougher to the touch like another reviewer said unfortunately after i had purchased and washed i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
5078,3.0,the fabric feel and design of this dress is sooo cute but so large that sadly it will need to go back beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering
5079,5.0,fully satisfied with the product and its performance for the last few days durability of the product with time needs assessment
5080,5.0,my favorite mi
5081,2.0,this dress is very cute and well made unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust the arm holes were too big yet the bust small very weird fit on me i am six feet tall with c bust maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric i love the dress it just wasnt made for my tall figure
5082,5.0,there really isnt much to say about this card other than its been very reliable and handles hd video from my gopro hero very well and without a glitchim not offering any benchmarks or other measurements of speed in comparison to other class microsd cards all i can tell you is that this card has yet to fail me and i am a longtime video professional who works in a commercialadvertisingmarketing environment so i need things to be reliable for all of my clientsrecording and transferring video from device to computer is a snap and ive had no issues with it since i began using it
5083,3.0,this top has too much fabric i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large
5084,1.0,front mp camera is fake
5085,4.0,this phone really featurerich pros good battery backup lasts for hours with moderate usage fast face unlock great camera flawless user interface haptic feedback of user actions portrait mode for selfies great video stabilization driving mode cons heavier than other iphones portrait mode is not perfect this is a common problem across all the smartphones including android i wont say it is costly as i got it in k approx on great indian festival sale
5086,1.0,extremely bad experience with this order reasons explained in the following post
5087,5.0,this dress is great wear now and into fall with boots and leggings it seems to have structure with the seams and is nicley flowy
5088,4.0,i received the watch on june th after spending months looking for options online for a good fitness watch ive been using the watch since then on a daily basis and still have battery left i dont use the sleep monitor feature at all i use the heart rate monitor while exercising and during my daily walks and disconnect it once i am done dont need the notification on my watch as the phone is always with me so i think the battery will last me at least another week on just one charge i had issues with the app as it was not connecting to the phone easily which now seems to be resolved after uninstalling and installing the app a couple of times heart rate monitor is great and the readings are pretty accurate i use the other feature while exercising as it gives me an overall of how ive performed and i love the graphs in spite of updating the app i still cant see watch face option in the app itself apart from that the look and feel of the watch is great weight is okay but cant see myself sleeping with it on my wrist
5089,3.0,this sweater is incredibly soft and pretty but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck i really wanted it to work but it was just so impractical
5090,3.0,has very limited internal memory need to buy memory card for sure os and default apps take more space than highlighted no great performance decent enough only to watch videos at p only
5091,3.0,face unlock is not good as compare to finger print sensor
5092,2.0,have not been able to install soooo disappointed need my money back
5093,4.0,its is worth but if your budget is k then go for some other laptop like lenovo it would provide you more features and higher configurations
5094,2.0,my review for it is bad its automatically close all the apps and does not support the sd card also and last day my all the media files had lost its the worst product i have purchased camera quality is good but overall bad
5095,2.0,im not sure whether i should be writing this review for the b shampoo or conditioner as im not exactly sure which is responsible for wrecking my hair im going to blame the conditioner because in theory even if a shampoo causes you some problems a good conditioner should be able to go a long way in working out at least some of those problems i purchased both the shampoo and conditioner as i saw they were new and im a sucker for trying new haircare products i have medium blonde hair that is dry and still a bit damaged from a salon haircolor disaster almost a year ago i have spent this past year buying and trying just about every moisturizing andor repairing haircare product that i can to restore my hair to the health and beauty it had before that hair salon owner tortured it it had really been starting to turn a corner in health and then i tried this the first time i used it my hair was really dirty and the shampoo certainly got it clean the conditioner feels very thick in hand and rinsed really clean but i noticed i did need a fair amount of detangler spray my hair also kind of had that quotdryquot feeling to it after it airdried the second time i tried both products it yielded about the same results but the third was a disaster this time i used them on hair that wasnt as dirty washed less than hours before i shampooed as usual and applied the conditioner initially the conditioner felt good like i could actually feel my hair slipping around on my back the instant i got out of the shower i had an quotuhohquot experience because i could literally feel my hair hardening and drying up i didnt really even towel my hair off and went straight to the mirror to add detangler spray even with a boatload of detangler i could hardly get my hair untangled i was snarly matted dry and tangly i lost a lot more hair than usual and i was so disappointed because this problem had so improved over the past few months prior to this incident my hair literally for days looked ratty and damaged its actually still getting over this stuff i dont honestly know what the problem was the shampoo lathers nicely has a very pleasant light smell does a good job cleaning apparently too good and the conditioner seems like it is conditioning and adding slip also smells nice very light fragrance but holy cow when you get to styling be warned dont wait too long or you may never get a comb through your hair again and no i did not change my washing technique or anything else my hair is air dried basically every day and then worn up in a clip also every day very little changes in my hair routine as far as that goes i am disappointed perplexed and my hair is sorry and sad i would clearly not recommend either the shampoo or the conditioner to anyone who needs moisture in their haircare products
5096,5.0,just i will go through this book for my bank examination that contents are very good author was provided ore exercises with key and he referred a lot of books

5102,1.0,we r not supposed to receive an old and copied book
5103,5.0,to my surprise this sweater is heavy chic and stylish its well made and fits tts im looking forward to wearing it i would recommend this tunic to everyone it looks better on me than the modelevent though it doesnt look bad you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater i really like all the different textures in this sweater
5104,2.0,annoying mobile phone just a garbagge except battery nothing in the phone camera is not good at all it looks like a mp camera and front was just disgusting the premiumness of the phone was just the plastic back was so cheap the display was good as it was super amoled but not canera not performance nothing in this garbagge dont buy it if you still have a samsung lover simply garbagge
5105,2.0,i recently bought samsung ms i discover some issues like network coverage is very low and also internet connection is a problem the internet is not continously flow it stop then working and so on if posible samsung fixed this problem
5106,1.0,pathetic product and service by company
5107,1.0,returned the earphones as of poor quality
5108,2.0,weighs down hair and makes it very difficult to style the next day wether it be with a curling iron or straighter this oil is also not pure and has silicones in it silicones can be good but if you use them too much it will cause a lot of buildup on the hair and make it drier in the long run if youre applying a oil its better to use a pure one i prefer the live clean argan oil
5109,4.0,fantastic smartphone under k budget but now there is so many option in k but as i brand of mi its better smartphone with good processor
5110,1.0,power cable is worest quality when put in a charging cable is melting

5113,5.0,worth for price
5114,3.0,takes a long time to fully charge also does not hold mah as i am unable to charge my phone times using this
5115,3.0,this dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves i do have average athletic arms but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off as i fix one shoulder another will slide down the material is nice but since it is not lined it feels inexpensive disposable
5116,3.0,it has problem in bluetooth connectivity with bluetooth headsets could not not pair with boat
5117,3.0,red colour of redmi is too much irritating boys door rhen redmi ke red color se kyu ki yeh red one plus and iphone wala red nhi haii bht zyda dark haiin maine to apna mobile loss main sell krdia red wala
5118,4.0,i saw this online wondered abt the sleeve length on me i was thinking about ordering the petite size since im only sometimes cardigans have longer sleeves than i want it was at the local store so i tried on the regular xs in the grey the fit sleeve length was fine what i didnt care for was a slight itchiness wool fiber some mild shedding alpaca fiber i decided against it but it is nice looking
5119,3.0,i typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes im a size in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting its super soft and i love the color but it was just unflattering on me
5120,4.0,i think the shirt is supposed to be a relaxed fit but i could have definitely gone down a size
5121,1.0,the battery is faulty it drains even when not in use
5122,3.0,ive only used this twice on my hair after a shower but i love it already this made my hair sooooo soft when my hair dries i couldnt stop touching my hair and the smell its to freaking die for it is so good but not overpowering if you dont like coconuts you wont like this as fir the splitend mending powers that is probably not true i cut off my split ends at a salon whenever i get my hair cut and i wanted a split end mender just to prevent split ends this might work for that but im not sure yet but dont buy this if you actually think it will cure your split ends it definitely wont nothing will except for cutting your split ends
5123,1.0,getting discharged automatically even when switched off want to return the mobile now
5124,2.0,camera is not good as expected and ear phones plug is type c gestures features also not good as expected
5125,1.0,so i got the iphone xr just today the product looks amazing but unfortunately the face id is not working and theres a glitch in the front cameras portrait mode thats fine it may happen but whats not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple firstly amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold talking about the giant apple the so called market leaders went to the service centre after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to bangalore for repair like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product and also to mention amazonin is not an authorised apple reseller i guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court thank you amazon and apple
5126,4.0,compact and easy to use product with lots of features
5127,5.0,the embroidery is actually navy blue not black like it shows in the photos which was even better for me these are so soft and feminine looking love love love please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer
5128,1.0,touch screen is poor often slips distributor had packed by selecting a lowest quality defective item from his store behind the curtain with a hidden motive to befool a unknown customer and to earn much more margin of profit collusion with amazans authoritiespuneet shukla lucknow

5130,1.0,i dont like this product because its work on bit plateform
5131,2.0,this dress looked gorgeous light and lacy in the picture but when it arrived the lace that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive the inner sheath was made of a heavy sequined material it was uncomfortable scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail it also added bulk to the dress so that i looked ten pounds heavier i cant imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip the si
5132,5.0,this is my nd echo dot and i am still very satisfied it keeps getting smarter and smarter as new skills are added at the great price its a cant miss
5133,2.0,on the very day itself that i got the product the hone screen button got jammed took it to apple care and after days they gave me a repaired phone with screen replaced on the next day the screen developed dark patches called apple care again and they said theres sone problem in the device and that i should try to get it replaced since its from amazon which is not a authorized iphone reseller however amazon denied it since date for return had passed so i then went to apple care again and after fighting with them for hours they finally agreed for a device replacement which arrived after days the phone has been tuning smooth since then however it was a horrible experience

5168,3.0,initially i bought this because i liked the color and style of this trench coat i thought it could look very chic and polished the problem was it was too large and too wrinkly im lbs and ordered an xs because petite sizes were unavailable but i realize that a petite xs wouldve been a better fit also the sleeves were too long even with an xs ive already returned the product

5183,3.0,i really like this oil i enjoy most of the oils that organix has it smells absolutely fabulous very easy to distribute evenly throughout hair especially when used after a shower while hair is damp great for softening hair and helping to loosen any tight knots doesnt make my hair have that greasy feeling it leaves a nice shine only downside is the bottle i wish it were in a pump so that i could better control the amount of oil i want but no other complaints update been months and ive come to realize that this is what is giving me backacne and acne along my hair line

5186,4.0,i saw this gorgeous blouse in a store over dark blue jeans on feb of course the store stock only went up to a size typical with the way the fit i knew i had to size up from my usual size and i did i ordered it in a size and it arrived on monday feb with lighteningfast speed it is breathtaking and fits wonderfully i like the top button undone the buttons are gorgeous and the blouse is very retro circa but you definitely have to go up one size the only
5187,4.0,amazing product value for money jbl is a brand and this is something i like quality is good voice is good overall great product
5188,2.0,this dress looked great on the hanger but once on it did absolutely nothing for me navy is one of my most flattering colors but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt that second color made me look drab i am with a long torso and wear a size in tts tops and dresses but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs i really needed the waist to be dropped further or higher
5189,4.0,i saw the cream color in size regular small in the only one left section at my local store i had my heart set on this dress all summer but it was sold out so i was super excited to see it the color is true cream like linen color i was surprised that the dress is very heavy as heavy as a medium sized coat i cant understand why its so heavy because the top is sleeveless and the dress part is pretty sheer the dress is about pass my feet which i wouldnt mind having it hemmed but the
5190,2.0,phone is nice in built wise but in software it is pathetic it automatically on the speaker mode while on phone call also camera is worst plz dont buy this my suggestion go for redmi pro
5191,4.0,ive been a mac user for almost years now i was really happy with the kind of support apple offers on known issues also ive always been an android user ever since i started using smartphones until recently when samsung started really getting on my nerves their devices develop either battery or display problems right after the warranty expires and guess what i said goodbye to samsung and android choosing to try out the whole ecosystem of apple instead i find this phone to be snappy simple and easy to use and of amazing build quality it does take a while of getting used to but then at the end i feel its worth it its got a great camera face id accuracy and quite good quite a good battery which should last you all day long
5192,4.0,just average headset for this price
5193,2.0,the sound quality is poor and the maximum volume is even less compared to my laptops
5194,3.0,this tee was meant to be loose and swishy but as it runs large sizing down means the sides come up really high as they curve a good higher up so your waistband is exposed and it just doesnt look nice returned an xs and small

5196,1.0,i was so excited about kindle but it has been a huge disappointment rather a horror the device was slow and lagging from the beginning and right after the return window was over it started behaving faulty the pages are turning automatically the touch is not working leaving the device completely unusable i called customer care and followed all of the resolution steps but to no avail it was still faulty now i am requesting a replacement for the device as it is still under warranty i have called multiple times but they always say it is eligible for replacement but there is a system issue due to which we cant place your request i dont know what should i do to get this device replaced every time i am left with false promises and then there is no followup from amazon on my issue i have got my hard earned money drowned in the gutter it is a mental harassment to live under the uncertainty whether i will get the replacement or not it is too costly to just ignore it i feel i am only left with option to raise a consumer complaint now if anyone faced the same issue and got a resolution please let me know too update after my incessant calls and complaints amazon returned the device as replacement device was not available

5204,5.0,best product i really loved it
5205,4.0,my store had only one of these in a size xs i tend to be more of a s in most retailer items it was roomy i am d figured a petite small would be a perfect fit i ordered the ps it arrived today is still pretty big the sleeves which are quite flared are a little shorter as is the overall length than the regular xs but overall the ps feels just as big if not bigger than the regular xs trying to decide if i should go back for the regular xs or order the regular xxs

5209,1.0,this skirt looks and feels cheap and the color is much more green than pictured additionally i comfortably wore a size and then lost a few pounds and this is still way too tight to be flattering
5210,2.0,slow processor and not running properly in excel
5211,1.0,do not buy on the first day itself the phone started heating up too badly the battery drains quickly camera doesnt even deserve star the only good thing is the appearance of the phone i hope i am able to return this phone coz its a total waste of money

5214,3.0,i ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around it just was so big and had no shape at all its possible i should have sized down to a small but im sending it back
5215,1.0,defective item delivered by amazon display defective has a thin vertical line
5216,2.0,im about lbs and ordered a size the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all i probably would wear a instead of the but could tell that even if i had the the cut of it still wouldnt be flattering on me at all it was baggy in odd places and had no shape the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice with a fitted slip design
5217,3.0,a decent speaker overrated though good for hostels
5218,3.0,im tossed up with this one ive only been using it for about a month and i love the feel and look it gives my hair after using it but after the next couple of days my hair doesnt seem that great the smell is just amazing i will say my hair is a bit softer but nothing dramatic ill keep trying it out though
5219,1.0,one of the worst shampoos ive ever tried it left ends in many knots it dried them out and made them brittle after a few washes i love the fact that its organic and the packaging and scent is very likable it made my long hair tangly brittle and dry i will definately not buy this again and i encourage you to not waste your money on this overly priced shampoo
5220,1.0,item is not working proper
5221,3.0,like
5222,4.0,bit heavy to carry otherwise its a beast and takes a some time to charge
5223,4.0,working well as described and it could charge your smartphone mah battery upto more than times when the power bank is fully charged not very ideal for travelling as it is quite heavy being mah made of plastic to cut down on power bank weight

5235,1.0,i purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought theyd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe on my second wear i happened to be on a longhaul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper outer thigh luckily id packed a backup dress the pants werent tight at all but the seams wrent strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess poor construction i would not recommend these
5236,4.0,everything you need to know and study about environment is in this bookvery detailed
5237,5.0,i love this and i have been noticing a lot less fall out than before though it doesnt really lather that well obviously because it is sulfate free if i wanted a shampoo to lather than id get a shampoo that has sulfates
5238,1.0,face unlock very slow
5239,3.0,gorgeous top but runs large especially in the arm holes
5240,3.0,everything things good good camera high storage body light weight mobile plastic good hard quality good size nice to use but battery backup is low charger is not good its volt you should buy volt battery because in volt and mobile function compression charger mobile become heat after hour when you charging i suggest you when you buy mobile if function have some little compression price you should st see battery and charger volt if you like high function quality mobile then gogood battery mag above or mah and charger capacity to charge volt
5241,4.0,our store only had one petite dress in my size in stock im and so can sometimes pull of petite sizing no in this case it was a tunic on me however the dress fit beautifully everywhere else and the quality was beautiful so ill probably order my size in regular to give it a try
5242,5.0,the photo doesnt do it justice the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans texture is light and gauzey but i dont find it too seethough sizing was tough im but thin on top usually between xs s and went with the xs on this ordered both to try sacrificing some length for a more flattering width great for the sale price
5243,2.0,any function not oprate
5244,3.0,i love the fabric however the overall fit did not work for me i think the arms are much smaller than the overall shirt
5245,4.0,ive only used it for a week or so works fine and my iphone charges fast but the power bank itself takes a very long time to charge ive been charging it on my laptop and its taken days and still not done maybe i need to try wall charging its also a bit heavy
5246,4.0,i like how this dress is really different and fun with the slit up the front and the short layer revealed underneath it can be worn in many seasons i wore it yesterday with sandals but i could also see wearing it with booties and a cardigan cute dress
5248,5.0,excellent book book arrived early then i expected
5249,3.0,this is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didnt find it to drape well on me it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps the style and design of the dress is great though for reference it did fit fairly true to size i wear a or the xs fit well if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress
5250,3.0,phone is worth with in this budget camera is not good low quality images from this camera battery is good no heating issues no lagging
5251,3.0,ok accto price
5252,5.0,i booked another mobile for my friend because i like the one ui i think user interface having great importance very good ui setting having search option changing data sim is very easy and others convenient features battery is best amongst all contemprory mobiles camara quality is good having convenient features to control and useful options good wide angle photography stability is very good during video recording samsung default apps like gallary calander calculator samsung notes my files these are day to day usable apps are excelent these are ads free and not best amongst all manufacturor display is excelent i compermises on notification light and infrared features due to above merits above review is based on one week use
5253,1.0,performance is not good battery gets drained out very fast and device gets warm
5254,3.0,phone is ok not suitable for this price it just k around
5255,4.0,good for a basic user i bought for my mom she dont know much about smart phone functionality but now she is enjoying using this phone
5256,3.0,camera is very good and the best part is battery life it just goes on cons are poor touch screen scensor very bad scrolling too heavy does not come with gorilla glass designing part needs improvement
5257,4.0,great camera good battery backup premium design handy size
5258,5.0,very nice phone
5259,2.0,this phone has been publicized with numerous gimmicks but the facts are entirely different speaker stopped working after week camera pathetic watercolour effect in the captured images when zoomed colours are bit faded in wide angle mode noticeable lack of details aka sharpness in the images samsung must learn from vivo mi cameras built flimsy back cover check and feel the cover thickness between finger print sensor surface and back cover surface for sure if it is dropped you are most likely to pay a visit in service centre and subsequent costly expenditures fingerprint sensor response is fairly slow as compared to the mid budget segment phones available in the market call recorder is not in built though options are shown in call settings you have to depend on rd party app heating it is still an issue exynos processors are generally considered as inferior to the snapdragon processor and with the similar apps executed for same time samsung phones heats up more battery is massive and so is draining use camera or gps and check the result it really drains fast only indian sim is permitted of course if you travel frequently abroad it is a major issue no native screen recorder for onscreen videos you will need rd party apps only screen shots are supported voice recorder built in voice recorder is loaded with ad no network speed indication in status bar so among the all above mentioned issues except point everything can be resolved by subsequent firmware update provided samsung wishes so
5260,1.0,i ordered but none of them were working properly one is not charging other one is not connecting and rd one is also not working and now since return window is closed im not even able to return it it was a gift to freind and this product put me in very embarrassing situation before friends
5261,5.0,gb seems to be the right size memory card for my needs the micro sd card fits several of my devices and downloads easily to the computer
5262,4.0,i bought opal black days back amazon was excellent in terms of delivery regarding this phone ill will cover few minor cons which are not covered in techies review which you should know but again you must consider the price range as well before making decisions pros mostly covered in you tube videos considering the price range screen size is big though back cover is polycarbonate it looks glossy n stylish don bother about people saying its plastic material n btw plastic is more durable than glass also if you put mobile cover then its design does not matter so back design should not be a concern battery is awesome processor is fast no lag at all till now display is super awesome since samoled screen is there cons network receptivity is little poor my previous motorola gets full network at same location where ms shows bars same issue with wifi network major drawback since primary function of any mobile is to help us talk which is compromised once you disconnect an ongoing call end call screen continue to display for sec or so this made me wonder initially if the call is disconnected or not app scroller screen is horizontal n cant be changed to vertical so if you are used to of vertical scrolling like me it will take time to get used to though can be fixed by installing some app launchers very rarely but yes sometimes finger print sensor does not work lag of just micro seconds not much camera is just ok i use very fast broad band which never let any video buffer even for sec in my amazon fire stick or any other mobile but in ms it does for sec this was most disappointing for me as i watch lot of videos online hope this will help you make your decision but as i said do consider features viz a viz price range will add more as n when i get to know like if this review helped you
5263,1.0,was not very good had trouble to get it to work and it still is not very good if i had to rate in on a scale of to and being to best i would give it a glad i did not have to buy it
5264,3.0,first thing first i have given star coz the packing quality was not as it should be for the safety of phone device review battery life is good but it should last long as it is mah camera quality is good but not as per mp with triple camera fingerprint sensor is really disappointing as there is latency best thing about this phone is display as per my opinion sound quality while using earphones is awesome as it comes with dolby sound it could be still improved in terms of quality and performance as promised by the company in their advertisement processor is quite good at the last you should consider how you wanna you use your phone which means what are the main features you are looking for
5265,4.0,bought this phone in november what i love about the phone its screen the phone is fast cameras both front and rear are great battery life is pretty good the only downside is the charging speed the phone charges slow with the standard charging cable that comes out of the box i personally feel apple should have atleast given a fast charger with such an expensive device
5266,4.0,i will brought this product with rs value of money good sound quality the noise is less
5267,3.0,recently i purchased mi a while charging the battery it gets heated up very soon and i am scared that it may blast so can you just guide me in this matter thank you
5268,5.0,colour was awesome i had purchasedprossesor was excellentat a time more than one apps running excellently
5269,5.0,good phone from apple expectation fulfilled
5270,2.0,i wanted to love this but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured it was a thick blazer type garment not at all what is pictured here unfortunately also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only love most retailer styles but this one was a miss and a return
5271,2.0,it did not reach my expectation although its price was just above my budget so i would like to get a replacement of another samsung m or samsung m i am also ready to pay for the extra charges for m it is not user friendly too so please consider my request i m also a regular customer for amazon hope u consider my request
5272,4.0,the sweater is comfortable and has a little s fabric flairnot quite as classically modern as it looks on the model i am keeping it because it is a true fallspring item not a fabric weight for summer wear in california the peach color is pretty muted so it is not a showstopping goingout piece
5273,2.0,displayed as mah its barely mah discharged very fast gets charged very slowly
5274,1.0,no very
5275,5.0,nice phone but no kidney left
5276,5.0,my shampoo bottle busted in my suitcase on the road i bought a ounce travel size for at walgreens if you buy the full size at for almost ounces thats not a bad price my hair is recovering from some abuse and gets frizzy and dry it has also thinned out recently and has lost a lot of its luster i need a good moisturizing shampoo that doesnt weigh my hair down or strip it and can remove build up it also needs to smell clean and elegant not like a clown threw up vanilla ice cream on my head this did the job i got many unusual complements on how shiny and soft my hair was the smell is a tad bit sweet but has a musk to it that makes it nice the fragrance didnt last past the next morning it wasnt as moisturizing as my current shampoo but it gave enough i had a little bit of trouble getting a lather but that could of been the water in the area the cap kept leaking after it was closed travelers hate leaking caps or its just my curse of leaking shampoo overall ive had the same result with other drugstore shampoos and i dont regret it i might buy a full size if i want to switch up one day
5277,3.0,i love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants

5280,3.0,in call voice is not clear above battery drains fast i had charged it times a day its not for gamers duplicate contacts issue and company does not care about it cameradisplaynetwork is fine no mm jack trust me guys it is the biggest cons
5281,3.0,i have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving thesei would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs i am and ordered a petite but i found the length to be about inches too long as compared to how they look on the model also the rise is relatively low otherwise the quality is great and the denim is very soft i will probably return these given that i am not wowed
5282,5.0,i love it exceeded my expectations
5283,5.0,the phone has an amazing battery life it can easy last one and a half day of heavy usage the super amoled screen makes the viewing experience soooooo much better gaming experience is pretty good being an iphone user since i must say this phone as a whole different experience than other you have felt for a phone
5284,3.0,i am a and ordered the ml its very large i normally take a large in retailer but i cant figure out my size in this its very wide i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the sm and see how it is
5285,1.0,the worst phone of mi till now i recommend other to not buying this product after using days phone start hang in process overheating and the network problem is the biggest problem in this phone i seeso dont buy this phone
5286,4.0,everything is is perfect but if you are buying this earphones for playing games pubg dont buy these earphones because there is a delay of sound for about one second and that really effects our game play but for calls and videos or songs these earphones are perfect at the price i got it for inr
5287,3.0,i like how this jacket is very versatile you can wear it to work or play it does have interesting detail on it i kept it based on the price and those details i have the olive color the arms are a little tight
5288,5.0,this is a beautiful dress the dress is a lighter blue when compared to the picture and the fabric is thick but the shape is beautiful the waist is very fitted but it didnt feel uncomfortable i didnt think the fabric was itchy as others mentioned i do think it is a bit short on the front it is a high low dress but at that is not a problem for me it was true to size for me lbs c
5289,5.0,really a very nice book for showing basics of investmentwith a limited payshows the differences between assets and liabilities
5290,2.0,these were so perfect for the first hour or so i was convinced they were my new favorite pants but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after id been sitting a couple hours it looked downright embarrassing saggy and wrinkly radiating from the crotch no less i got them in the gray and its possible that other colors use different less awful fabric
5291,2.0,this romper is cute wellmade and true to size but i havent figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on not sure what the designers were thinking here im returning this one
5292,4.0,best mobile in this range main camera mp is not enough for this mobile i had purchased m series in this m series mobiles one thing i have observed that it is not possible to block mobile data completely for certain apps only we can restrict background data it is one of the main drawback that mobile data usage will become high in other company mobiles this feature is given i dont know why samsung is not providing this feature
5293,4.0,i got this as a gift from my daughter and its a great addition to my home office i am planning on buying another one or two for other areas in the house its very handy as a personal digital assistant i often need to check time andor weather in other parts of the world and its faster than trying to look up on my computer when alexa tries to read something like a price it is very funny it reads every digit as a separate digit so comes out one dollar five zero zero zero like that they definitely need to work on that
5294,5.0,i think i could eat this stuff but i guess ill settle for nice smelling shiny hair
5295,4.0,no problems with display quality the sound is loud but there is a problem with sound when viewing dth channels the dialogue is muffled a little bit no changes to the equaliser could give me satisfactory results also the tv is thick my year old tv was way slimmer also the wall mount provided is not slim so there is a lot of gap between tv and the wallvery disappointed with this one also note the fact that the tv has a plasticky cheap feel to it despite all these flaws i dont regret my decision edit the apps on tv are quite good most major apps are covered i had to buy a sound bar to address the muffled dialogue problem
5296,2.0,volume not enough alarm too soft
5297,1.0,data cable is faultyi received a damaged audio jack with the insulation gone

5300,4.0,this is a great pullover very cute for lounging at home or running errands it does run large i ordered an xs its pretty big for reference im lbs b it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute
5301,5.0,lovely airy fabric and colors true to the pictures online i am and lb i ordered a regular s and it fits fine yes it is midi length coming to about below my knee i would have preferred the length if it had been available but it was not still i will compensate by wearing higher heels the embroidered embellishment along the neck and sides stands out more than in the pic and really makes this dress special the cutaway shoulders give it sophistication if you want to a
5302,4.0,i decided to order this skirt to look at it and regret it now as i want to keep it one bummer is the smallest size xs runs big the skirt falls on my lower waist aka hips on me not on my waist bu i love the look it has pockets where the pattern reverts the fabric is soft and thick making the skirt structured the length was nice on me though ti is a mini and there is no petite size the hem still was above my knee and therefore was acceptably flattering the colors are also nice for fal
5303,1.0,silly product thats a solution to nonproblems
5304,5.0,this dress is very well made the fabric is thick enough for winter weather and is great for work or a nice party i do not think the arm openings are too large at all
5305,3.0,good battery but poor camera
5306,2.0,this wasnt for me i have a short neck and am the length was fine on the one i tried on but other proportions were off it was too big around in the middle yet tighter at the bottom on me this made it resemble a large bag the neckline stood up on mine even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model it still felt like a whiplash collar coming up over my chin i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft
5307,1.0,i was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic the sweater is much shorter than i thought i wish i could return it i bought a size large which is my normal size
5308,4.0,nice tv in this budget but you cant expect more on this tv amazon delivery was really superb their delivery date was on th october but received on th october installation done today th october installation person was good really helpful still checking on the settings will review again after few months of usage sound is loud but cant expect home theater feelings but product is really good
5309,4.0,nice to handle
5310,3.0,i am and lbsordered the blue motif in small petite they were not only too big overall but were way too long i had to roll them up several times to get the right length because of fabric design these would definitely have to be hemmed i had to check tag because i thought for sure i got sent a regular length but they were petite not sure if they are worth trying in a smaller size pants were really comfy but maybe too pajama like for my taste
5311,2.0,this looked so odd on me i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom the top is really large as to be unflattering perhaps its just that it doesnt work on someone who is petite but this one is a return
5312,3.0,pretty top online okay in person runs small especially on bottom hemline thought it would have a swing to it it does not more sheer in person than i thought it would be that wouldnt stop me from keeping it though it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering looked like i was wearing a bib i dont have a large chest just weird look on me unfortunate because it is an adorable print top made for thinner or a petite lady
5313,1.0,your mobile is defected and this is not a replacement or a return which makes me suffer a lot please do not give any such bad product to anyone
5314,3.0,bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost fabric feels cheap like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly did not flatter the female form felt like a burlap sack gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag returned it

5320,5.0,connection speed is really good
5321,2.0,sir please cheak this product
5322,4.0,i bought this dress for my upcoming rehearsal dinner in early fall i love the romantic lace and ivory color for the occasion i ordered my typical size it hits me right where it does on the model and it fits well on top but the dress bells more than the images let on i didnt want to size down in fear that the neck would be too tight so i took it to an alterations specialist to get a lot of the lace fabric trimmed off she took it in a little at the waste and the underarm and hacked q
5323,2.0,unless you have the body of the model tall and very thin and wear a really small size dont even think about getting this dress its literally a heavy sack it hit right above my knee in the front and basically midcalf in the back the material is nice but its an awful shape
5324,1.0,ordered the biggest size available the large the arms are so tight i couldnt get it on looked like it may have fit in the body so i dont understand why so constricting in the arms i dont have big arms either fabric is thin but the color is pretty cant recommend id pass on this one
5325,5.0,this top runs a tad big its beautiful in person and sooooo soft definitely an retailer staple top material and cut is great
5326,4.0,best sound quality better than some sony headphoes but noise cancellation is very poor could not be use bike ride because that much of poor noise cancellation otherwise sound quality and connectivity is very good battery life is ok hrs
5327,2.0,this serum is very thick heavy and gummy and sticky feeling like putting castor oil in the hair im sort of impressed because it is hard for me to actually find products that are quotenoughquot for my hair and this serum was way too much for me i have very thick very long straight hair i tried many ways to using this first i tried just the ends and it left my hair feeling like a ball and chain it was so heavy oily and stuck together mind you i did only use a little bit i did the mistake of applying it mid shaft and down and my hair was so gross afterwards sticky heavy weighed down and greasy i once tried this as a pre shampoo treatment just to get rid of it huge mistake it took three washes with shampoo and i eventually resorted to dish washing soap to get it all out i cannot imagine people with fine hair using this after my amazon forest of hair cant tolerate this i do like the smell but thats not enough for me to keep using this or buy it again
5328,2.0,the name and the product reviews made me expect a lot out of this book and it turned out otherwise the book starts out well explaining the laws of physics and the universe as and how they developed along with the authors learning curve as well however the book ends with the spirit of science which holds that a law or theory is correct untill its proven wrong this left me with no insight or the seed for curiosity
5329,5.0,wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy i havent worn skorts since the s and this was such a nice return to that trend
5330,3.0,i have mixed feelings about htis top it is a nice shape and comfortable fits triue t o size but hte fabric is thin adn sheer i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale the fit me perfectly lbs dd chest

5334,4.0,i really like this i use or sprays of it every morning i dont think i will buy this again because im getting some higher quality moroccan oil for christmas the one with the blue label and the big orange m on it lol i cant remember that brand right now in all i think its pretty good product it only makes my hair oily when i add too much but this is a grate starter product to buy if you never used moroccan oil for your hair i defiantly recommend this as your first try to see if you like moroccan oil also its only like or at target so its easy to find and pretty cheap
5335,5.0,best item you can have for this price it does a lot of tricks and its constantly learning totally worth the price you can connect to a speaker with bluetooth or a p cable and it becomes even more useful for music playing and other tasks
5336,2.0,speaker clarity is not up to the mark design and camera is k exchange policy is worst
5337,3.0,fingerprint reader is very slow as per other devices of this rangeand camera quality is very very poor as per discriptioned in featurenight mode is very bad no picture takes without some point of light and its not a mp camera if we select mp camera mode than the photo will be not in hd quality it is uncleared if we zoom that photo than photo will be bad but actually if we take the photo in mp and zoom it than its not crackthan camera is very low and battery is good but not as per mah
5338,4.0,seems to be working just finebought as a gift for a family member and theyre using it for video recording
5339,3.0,i purchased these in a petite and a regular the r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee they were also loose in the waist and overall body the p fit great in the waist and body however past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the reg the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white
5340,5.0,just to back up what everyone else is saying this poncho is perfect it is indeed super soft casual and fun i personally thought the coloring at the bottom was even prettier than pictured this poncho is not tight around the neck yet not lose it goes right over your head without messing up your hair i love the sleeves they can be worn above the elbow or easily pulled just down below it a great alternative to a sweater i ordered the petite xss and im hits right at bum

5348,1.0,i bought i phone from reliance digital and i must say i am very disappointed with the product and its after sales service as the phone has some serious heating issues specially if you are multitasking such as charging and connecting to hotspot at the same timei bought this issue to apple care and reliance digital guys notice but no body is accepting that it is an issue after keeping my phone with them for more then a month even there are lags while operating the phone after investing almost k if this is the kind of experience you get out of your purchase its very sad and sickening looks like i phone got some issues but manufacturers are trying to hide to keep their success story running do not go for it

5362,4.0,after weeks of usage at k this tv is certainly value for money if you are planning to purchase please keep these in mind there are lot of algorithms that the tv uses to enhance your picturevideo viewing quality to match k hdr rendering hence by default a frame rate enhancer is enabled which makes fhd appear as k i personally did not like it it makes the whole experience as if viewing a mobile recorded video i turned it appear and everything is perfect remember as satellite tv consumers most are are still at fhd content consumption the space between your walltv unit and tv is very small i mean really really small the default wall mount almost gives no breathing space to the tv so i got additional spacers that increased the gap by inches little better but still not best if you need to access ports on the backside i would soon be upgrading to a flexible wall mount that allows pullingpushing tv i liked the tv border with silver color not all may like it please see renders before you purchase builtin bluetooth works like a charm the builtin speakers are generally very decent for a led tv however i did use external speakers as i need more clarity and bass i experienced stutter in screen mirroring when playing k videos on tv when the tv is wifi connected i certainly find this as a nuisance because we would need to leave the tv on wifi after all its smart tv and i mostly use it for that i returned my first unit which had the same issue its there on the replaced unit as well hence would assume this is inherent to this model you have youtube netflix and amazon prime videos builtin experience of netflix on this tv is simply awesome i will add more soon
5363,2.0,these pants looked worn washed old looking when i received them the quality is super thin cotton as if its been washed a million times is about to fall apart the workmanship is terrible you can see loose stitching all over the top portion is too tight looks terrible stretched out i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online

5387,3.0,product manufactured in dec iphone silver color looks slightly faded and the same observed by seeing the broacher in iphone package not happy by seeing that i definitely suggest people to buy the high price tag products directly from showroomstoreatleast we will have sense that we bought right quality product for a reasonable price

5393,3.0,value for money in this price tag however con you need to know before buying this i think two major battery life is not good as quoted by company im getting days battery life compare to days claimed by company with modest use in day time you cant see display clearly that means company need to correct this else this will be useful during evening or morning time indoor only rest feature wise its great
5394,5.0,beautiful phone
5395,5.0,beautiful did not look like much on the hanger but this is a beauty give it a try i am normally a size and the small fits perfectly it should be loose fitting with a dropped not so obvious flounce the colors are subtle and it will go nicely with many lightweight summer pants and shorts
5396,3.0,features are good for this price range but display quality is so weak that not withstand for single drop my phone dropped from my pocket and screen damaged even with case cover
5397,1.0,please don not purchase this fitbit product as they do not have a service centre in india after months if it doesnt work you have to throw it in the dustbin thats exactly what i did as they dont have any service center in india my watch stopped and gone blank it didnt charge and after following the instructions given by the customer care nothing helped
5398,2.0,the fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders what a pity had to return
5399,2.0,steps count is not accurate it counts double double for single step heart rate also not shown most of the time notification was not able to connect with phone
5400,1.0,battery performance worst and getting fast heated

5402,1.0,camera quality worst batter life is less than a day phone over weight touch is not good also hang sometimes
5403,4.0,i like display size compactness style photos dislikes are not having more battery capacity k recording stock android
5404,2.0,this sweaterjacket looks just like the photo in real life but the inside is so scratchy i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper unlined and uncomfortable no thank you should you choose to proceed i found the fit tts im wear an and the medium worked for me
5405,5.0,good and better sound and picture quality at this price range
5406,5.0,i really like this iphone xr its very easy to use and the best part is no no hanglag at all its camera does a decent job as well i recommend this to others
5407,3.0,i like the bass it produce but when i tried to listen d audio it didnt work
5408,4.0,love my dots its fun to have several all over the house if i had one complaint it would be the quality of the speaker but not so much that i cant have fun with them i can have music everywhere
5409,3.0,pros looks stunning high end category battery is also powerful fast charging cons camera is not upto mark as it says mp its like mp storage memory statistics are confusing showing mb free though i am not accessing much resources earphone slot given at down side which makes difficult to handle phone
5410,4.0,has every thing you might be looking in an iphone except the oled screen camera is as good as iphone xs with few limitations if display is not a big concern for you you cant get a better phone than this at this price range
5411,2.0,such a beautiful and unique design i only wish it fit it is so so boxy im thin but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right and i dont mean making it super tight the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately so i had to return this despite really wanting to find a way to make it work
5412,3.0,totally good but battery life worst
5413,3.0,after days use pros great display dolby atmos night mode wide angle camera recording natural colors in camera not punchy like reamext very low radiation sarlevel unlike other chinese companies cons its usp was mah battery but battery drain is just like another mah phone heats on downloading larger files like pubg no display protection as many other manufacturers give in same price range
5414,2.0,sound quality is not so good and not so bad id say average bass is good but not so strong with treble but the main problem is the durability in months battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working this is the second time im having a terrible experience with boat earphones earlier with a different model im really starting to think if theyre worth it because of this durability concerns
5415,3.0,camera quality not so bad
5416,4.0,love the way this top layers under my jackets and sweaters so romantic and pretty i am not experiencing the over pouf at the waist that a previous reviewer complained about the fabric is slightly itchy and the top shipped to my house has misshapen shoulder bumps from the store hanger all the beautiful styling pics done by retailer employees on ig is what made me want this blouse whatever is going on with the model shot really really really does not represent how cute this top looks in fact
5417,1.0,guys please i request all of you i have used this phone for last four months almost and its phone call mike stopped working dont know what to do you dont even find service centre nearby
5418,3.0,i have a few pairs of the stevie ankle so i thought i try these they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist the distressing near the front pockets is really apparentlike white stripes they make the jean look overall cheap not worth in my opinion
5419,2.0,company provide bag for camera is use less short hang string stiching not up to mark fabric leatherite very low quality bag size not according to camera not proper in camera bag given with camera is only formality bag does not look original by nikon
5420,5.0,i recommended it for my gf bcz of its camera quality and she liked it very much
5421,5.0,i purchased the blue and i love the style and fit of the shirt i worry a bit about the slit showing too much cleavage in certain positions but my friends have assured me that it is work appropriate very flattering and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it
5422,5.0,this top it is so simple but so great at the same time it does run large and im not a skinny girl but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesnt take away from that i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft washedjean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather its casual but so comfy its great for loungin
5423,3.0,product is ok ok earphone should be given with the productwhy it is not provided
5424,2.0,i bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back the texture is nice but lets call them what they are thin leggings not worth the price in my opinion honestly i cant seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so id spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans
5425,1.0,dont buy this product if in case you purchased a kevin smarttv and some issue are facing within days of purchase they will not replace the product picture quality is very bad i uploaded some photos
5426,3.0,its not as great as i heard the camera is good but front camera is ok the back camera quality is not that good comapred to older version and gicen its features og high resolution all in all just ok for the gicen price
5427,2.0,pros good looks light weight and thin goog battery life cons finger senser is little bit lagging sometimes unresponsive screen touch is sometimes unresponsive i have to touch icons multiple times to open them this is some times very disappointing camera quality is not upto my expectations
5428,4.0,its a pleasure to wear this sweater it feels like you are wearing a hug its that cozy yet its almost weightless which is nice for me because i get overheated easily the only slight downfall is that it is dry clean only i got this in charcoal but both color options are so pretty and you will be pleased how dressed up and flattering they look without giving up comfort
5429,3.0,i bought this product because i was short on cash and desperately needed something with protein to help with my highlightdamaged hair thanks to loreal frost amp design usually i use tigi dumb blonde reconstructor its definitely not the same but after a few uses i decided to purchase the matching shampoo too the conditioner has an odd texture because of the glycerin in it i also end up using a dab of suave after i rinse the organix out because it doesnt detangle my naturally curly hair as much as i prefer what i like is that some of my curl pattern is returning and its better than using nothing what i dont like is that i must use mousse or gel when air drying or else i get a frizzy mess something that doesnt happen with tigi still it smells good and since i can buy both shampoo and conditioner for less than what id pay for the dumb blonde alone ill stick with this until i finish the bottle btw the bottle is ridiculously hard to deal with after a few uses ill have to remove the top in order to get the rest of the conditioner out
5430,2.0,i loved this dress when i saw it however the fit was way off i am lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect unfortunately the waist hit way too high above my rib cage and the dress was too short it was as if it was a petite size i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty easy dress to just throw on for school unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both the material is also not the s
5431,3.0,this dress is very cute and fits quite well you dont have to wear a bra with it which is awesome and it has delightful pockets the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird it is very heavy and stiff also the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best im keeping it though
5432,3.0,beautiful thick sturdy denim probably the best denim i own in terms of the material the cut can be awkward as it can be tight across the thighs and hips and kinda makes my butt flat however i love the wash and quality of the material and at a sales price totally worth it
5433,1.0,poor product pro is better than mi a features and resolution is very poor
5434,3.0,good product at these prize range
5435,4.0,very comfortable top exactly what i was looking for on the hotter summer days the white is a bit sheer but a nude strapless worked just fine for me i also bought the pink and it is a very pale soft pink the material is super soft like typical cloth stone products
5436,3.0,flagships theyre high end premium devices that come out once a year commonly which pack pretty much every high tech feature imaginable they represent a companys idea of what a powerful phone should be but like a lever other phone even they get old and im guessing we all use our premium phones for at least years in that case how a phone ages overtime also plays a crucial role in determining its power and value so taking a second look at them after several years of release is a worthwhile thing to do lets do just that how about we take a second look at apples ex flagship model the iphone s how has it aged since september is it still worth buying in lets find out so the iphone s has seen some price drops recently the base model has been bumped up to gb which if not impressive is still better than the worthless gig model we had earlier you all know how that phone was perceived by the public back in after all the excitement died down these are the things that have kinda held up after approximately years of usage the build the phone is made our of series aluminium and has managed to survive a few minor drops over the period of its moderate usage it will last a pretty long time if you are somewhat careful with your handling the display yes i know its not even p but the lack of pixels isnt as evident unless you compare it side by side with a full hd panel on its own its still pretty good though you cant play p videos on your premium phone but it has that excellent brightness output of close to nits so theres that the front camerasomewhat the front camera remains pretty good even among the present gen smartphones which are all set out to be selfie experts youll have good quality selfies and videos upto p from this front snapper although you get higher quality videos from other phones you cant deny the accurate colors that this phone captures the software well im talking about the software support it still has the latest and greatest os updates from apple and wont be discontinued any time soon thats not to say its flawless though ive experienced several lags and slow downs and crashes throughout the ui from ios till to date more on that later these were some of the things that still remain significant despite to the cutthroat competition now lets look at the things that arent doing too well after aging the general performance now let me be clear the s is not a laggy mess by any means to a lot of people its still a pretty fast and fluid phone but it does slow down quite a lot ive seen a lot of phones and i can clearly see some dropped frames in the ui animations and delays while opening apps such as camera or facebook in other words even the iphone is affected by age and can slow down to a crawl overtime the gb model ive seen has managed to stay decently responsive but hasnt aged as smooth as something like the nexus p that phone is still one of the smoothest out there battery life you probably saw this one coming the small mah on the s barely lasts a day of usage and has gotten worse overtime having too many apps on board along with mixed g wifi usage drains this tiny cell pretty quickly you wont make it through a day if youre constantly using wireless services recharge speed also sucks the puny charger included can barely pump put amp of current and takes about an hour and a half to completely charge this thing its unacceptable at least in my view because its dumb such a small battery unit shouldnt take so damn long to charge up the hardware yeah things arent too bright over here either im taking about the sensors and stuff after years of usage the fingerprint sensor known as touchid has stopped reliably working it fails to recognise my fingerprint times thats sad considering it was one of the finest when it was launched it was positively criticized of being way too fast at the time now its way too frustrating the finger as well as the home button needs to be cleaned nicely before i can place my thumb on it but when it does work its still pretty fast at unlocking other things like the genealogy specs arent too great for either though gb of ram is good enough for ios its not the king of multitasking any more the ddr unit can barely keep some heavy duty apps and games open in the background youll see a lot more app and launcher reloads with modern day apps and this will only get slower overtime the rear camera though the front sensor remains pretty competent the rear camera sadly isnt the mp sensor with a tiny aperture is easily bested by even mid range phones of the present day its good enough outdoors bit produces pretty grainy and blurry images indoors and at night not super happy about that okay this was the breakdown about whats good and whats not good about the iphone s today so should you buy this price dropped phone now if youre a strictly casual user who sticks to basic apps doesnt mind about the rather poor battery life but wants above average performance id say go for it youll probably be okay with the gb storage too but if you are anywhere near a moderateheavy user zone you know what to do already look elsewhere there are much much better phones that this one for hardcore road warriors among you which will not only serve you well overtime but will also pack modern hardware
5437,3.0,power charging ratio is somehow low as described in the specification the product is slim and portable and charging is also fast

5462,4.0,overall good phone at this price range but the in screen fingerprint reader is worst of allit takes more than three seconds to unlocktotal useless
5463,1.0,general review i had made a terrible mistake of buying this laptop despite all the negative reviews this laptop is not meant for gaming even though there is literally gaming written on the product title and on the product itself any game will get stuck randomly and you will have no option other than to force shut down the entire laptop i have attached several videos where the laptop got stuck and these videos are shot in just days after receiving the laptop the reason for the problem the laptop gets stuck due to power limit on the processor set by asus when the gpu is under load this is a bios limit and cannot be changed by the user ih is a watt cpu but whenever the gpugtx and cpu is under load together the power to cpu is limited by the bios to only watts whenever during gameplay or heavy load this threshold gets crossed the laptop gets stuck even though this is done to control the thermal throttling heating issue which this laptop used to have earlier it creates many new problems refundreplacement process i mistakenly oversaw the fact that amazon does not offer refund for laptops but only replacement i had to go through a very time consuming process to finally return this laptop and get a refund first of all they will send a technician to your address to check the issue then if the technician confirms that there is a problem they will provide a replacement then again they will send a technician to check the product if you face the same issue and after that you will finally they will accept your refund request it is a very tedious process so be careful but i would like to say that amazon customer care is very friendly and help you in any way that they can and its not their fault that they have to follow a certain set of guidelines conclusion if you want to buy a laptop for gaming asus has released a newer model fx which deals with all these issues and there are many other companies which you can consider asus also has the rog series which does much better in gaming if you do not game or dont do tasks which require gpu and cpu stressed together you can go for it otherwise please dont ps if after reading my review you are still not convinced just google asus fxgm power limit throttle or asus fxgm problems and read the threads on different forums or just watch youtube reviews
5464,2.0,it was promised that the product will have a backlit keyboard but the keyboard doesnt has the feature beware of the fraud by amazon seller

5467,2.0,i bought this product during flash sale after a lot of research between this and an almost identical d and nikon the interface is better than both in particular i like the rotatory button at back and display on top however when i received it i checked the camera and found the sensor mirror was dirty had some particles dust or something i decided instead of investing just replace the camera as any such imprefection on sensor mirror defeats the purpose of such camera amazon was understanding of the issue and helped me in generating a new order will write a detailed review after using it
5468,5.0,i love how soft and substantial the fabric is the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully the ruffle detail is very flattering i have broad shoulders and this top looks great

5485,4.0,best smart tv if your looking for something cheap the apps are a little problematic now and then otherwise it works fantastically
5486,5.0,there really isnt a whole lot to say about this the amount of storage space is fantasticthere are options for using this on older devices that dont necessarily support microsdxc formats windows by default will only allow you to format the card as exfat or ntfs these formats will work for most new devices but some may have issueif you use fat as the filesystem instead you can use this card for older devices and it still works great with android ive been using this card on my old sandisk sansa fuze running rockbox and it works great i was not expecting that but i am very happy with it

5506,1.0,really unfortunate to get a defective screenused it only for days such an awesome tv otherwise
5507,5.0,couldnt have received a better laptop look macs arent for gaming so dont expect good gameplay but if you really wanna get a performance it will have it for you with a little heating it surfs like a beast if you do casual stuff like browsing or typing you will be surprised the fans rarely kick in the battery is a bomb provides service all around the day with medium brightness takes around hrs to charge and man the safe charging system rocks you will never tip off the mac editing is managed like a magical spell no issue at all but dont expect it to serve like a macbook pro its air in terms of style man it will rock you trust me you wont regret
5508,1.0,very very very slow system takes mins to start excel files doesnt open at all dont take this product
5509,3.0,i wanted to love this it is so cute and the xxsp my usual size fit perfectly however there was a fatal flaw in the construction the hem was not sewn properly very asymmetrical and lopsided instead of a scoop like shown on the model it was much longer on one side than the other i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong this is going back i ordered another one now its on backorder hopefully
5510,2.0,its a cute idea but its so low cut and the material is very thin i was hoping to wear it as a cool flowing summer top but ill have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it im only keeping it because it was such a good price also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten
5511,2.0,very bad experience in this iphone xr there are so many issues in this phone like when i click on airdrop icon then phone freezes and i have to force restart to get it working next imessage and facetime is not working as expected and last but definitely not the least is the hardware issue phones camera seems to be of very bad quality compared to iphone plus which was way better
5512,4.0,im very glad i snatched this up when i did it is super soft and the perfect length i love the slight peplum as it makes for a very flattering fit i can tell this shirt will be a staple year round as it works great with shorts or jeans for me i think the large was a tiny bit big in the waist but it might shrink in the wash the armholes were nice too and didnt gap
5513,4.0,camera picture quality is good

5521,3.0,as other reviewers have noted the fit of this tee is very boxy it looks okay tuckedin to high waisted jeans but otherwise is unflattering also the color is described as black but mine looks like a navy blue in person i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult but if able to i would have returned it
5522,3.0,bad battery
5523,3.0,this dress has great potential i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off as a previous review stated its short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree the hem is also funky i am still deciding if i want to keep it but if i do i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too for reference im and weigh and i purchased a size
5524,5.0,awesome productbass is greatgo for it
5525,2.0,for me does nothing for the frizz the only thing it does is pull the curl out of my hair i guess because of the weight it actually makes my hair look worse due to this smells amazing though definitely will not repurchase

5534,1.0,i am so sad i have to return these leggings theyre adorableso much so that my fianc commented favorably on thembut as other reviewers have pointed out theres no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or theyll fall down why sleeping on snow whyyyyyyyyyyy theyre so great otherwise

5547,1.0,theres a lot of reasons why brazillian keratin treatments arent found in stores like youd find colour or perm kits and the formaldehyde contained in them is one of those reasons which is how i imagine this product made it onto shelves in the first place however a lot of other factors play into the results you get with this so bear with me as far as the grueling details id just like to add that yes i am a stylist but im also very aware of basic biochemistry im a member of naturallycurly and the long hair community and i have let myself lose money talking clients out of buying products that werent ging to work for them this is a review written entirely for your safety and the quality of your hair firstly did you know that salt from water softeners the ocean and certain types of shampoos and conditioners even gentle ones like for example all of the lines you can purchase at tjs can ruin or at the very least tamper with the results of this type of bkt you probably didnt thats why salons prefer that you return to the salon to wash theirs out where they can control this much better or that the temperature of your flat iron during the process as well as how many times you pass it through the hair really is one of the most important parts your flat iron depending on its quality probably isnt going to give results quite as accurate as most professional models ive had a couple clients come in having issues with this product and come to find out they were using an iron that was years old how about this osha allows formaldehyde to be labelled as any one of the following methylene glycol formalin methylene oxide paraform formic aldehyde methanal oxomethane oxymethylene or cas number most of these products contain some sort of quotaldehydequot like formaldehyde because of the similarities between the ways that keratin and formaldehyde bond as far as their molecular geometry quotaldehydequot bonds are slightly cleaner thus stronger and shinier than keratin bonds thats exactly why they use it quotformaldehyde preserves or fixes tissue or cells by reversibly crosslinking primary amino groups in proteins with other nearby nitrogen atoms in protein or dna through a ch linkagequot although i dont recommend these treatments in general i will say that the professional haircare industry has come out with one or two genuinely formaldehydefree bkts within the past year so do your research find out whats safe and thats the way its done
5548,3.0,too much repairs in year of time

5550,4.0,after using this phone for weeks here are some pros and cons pros the battery is really great i dont remember of hearing any beeps of battery low on this phone on continous usage you can expect the phone to last for hours i remember that once even on single charge the battery lasted for days on regular usage the processor is really good for gaming this phone doesnt hang unlike my old samsung galaxy j camera is really good for wide angle shots fingerprint sensor is also very fast connecting to other devices is also really good with this device display quality is really great cons face lock is a bit slow the front camera for selfie is not as good but not that much concern after all

5564,4.0,i find myself gravitating towards comfortable items currently this one caught my eye because of its length tunic and because unlike many of the items right now it actually appeared fitted only after that did i notice the pretty detail on the sleevesthe price point is too high for a casual item such as this but the sleeves do make up for it the cut is really great for my straight and slender body type perfect a great weight for those inbetween temperatures that well be feeling as we

5567,1.0,the worst phone ever had in my life i would never recommend anyone to buy a realme phone build quality is so cheap
5568,2.0,i tried this product for several weeks with high hopes for a protein product with this thick amp full biotin amp collagen weightless healing oil treatment you get what you pay for economical but ineffective the only difference is it adds shine to your hair which you could easily get with olive or coconut oil
5569,4.0,sound quality is not that good its just near exellent rest of the things are fine
5570,3.0,great jeans by pilcro too short and snug around my knees for keeping though
5571,3.0,i liked this dress so much in the store but didnt have it in my size so had it shipped and yes paid shipping costs but it just didnt work on my body the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word it made me look kind of poofy all over and really i am not poofy its a lovely color and might look terrific on a tall woman but at not so good had to return sadly
5572,2.0,purchased this handset for my mother and using it myself for last few weeks here are quick words performance system hangs apps freezes screen becomes unresponsive its not an exception once a while but it happens too frequently camera not impressive but manageable fingerprint sensor most erratic part of the phone is its fingerprint sensor takes a while to unlock the phone display impressive considering the price point os biggest let down is miui with ads in miui the phone doesnt feels like yours battery not great but good works just fine
5573,3.0,cons charging point is totally different than usual charging points of samsung hence one need to keep carrying charger along with him or purchase to chargers camera quality is very poor its like normal phone camera unable to connect to usb by otg due to different shape of charging port battery life is not good its as if of normal phone samsung should not fool the ppl they should not try to bring down their brand image by such claims without onground features

5577,5.0,amazing phone in this price
5578,3.0,these sleep pants are very pretty soft and comfortable unfortunately after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price i dont mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case im not so sure i guess if you dont really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then whats the point of buying them
5579,2.0,got a damaged phonedisplay side cracked unhappy with camera quality its not upto mark like a mp camera its nameshake only vivo v mp camera is far better than this other than all things are good
5580,1.0,the product i received was not up to the mark after month ear phones one side ear is not working i think i got the duplicate product so i am not satisfied with the product quality

5584,4.0,works good
5585,1.0,no for other apps like hotstar sunnext worst product for investing on buy a roku or apple tv
5586,4.0,the build of the product is built of plastic but its really strong to keep the weight light good placement of the keyboard and yes its a full sized keyboard the cooling is average but the fans are loud brilliant hz smooth display but to keep in mind it has hz and hz instead of z and hz the trackpad feels weak although precise over all its a beast of a machine for the price of k i dont think there is a better competitors to this
5587,5.0,cant wait for the weather to cool so i can wear this the split back makes it very flattering the green is definitely more brown
5588,5.0,this shirt is super soft and comfortable luckily its a good length and not at all short

5593,4.0,decent phone in rd
5594,2.0,except the camera nothing is good if you invest k to k extra you will get better one no sd card slot gb space is enough but when you click photos it upload to your google drive as back is on if you off the backup then gb space will be minuscule secondly when you download the photos the quality slightly downs and if you in a area where internet is not working or slow working you would not be able to download your photos if there is sd card then no need for such activities sd card slot missing causing a lot of problem mm jack is missing for this they provide ctype connector through which you can insert you jack but for this you always have to carry it charging cable it is different from any other charger and you have to carry it always in overall if invest k more you can get better choices in my opinion avoid this phone

5600,4.0,this jacket is really cute however the mesh is really fragile ive had the jacket for a month and noticed a huge tear down the back shoulder it doesnt fit me tight so im not sure how it happened every time i wear it im super paranoid about snagging it on something like i mentioned before the jacket is cute its lightweight and the design is unique but if you want to get more than an occasional wearing out of this then dont bother im hoping i can return it otherwise thats a lot of
5601,1.0,got it for during a flash sale the left earphone stopped working properly within a week got it replaced thanks to amazon the replacement is even worse the battery dies down within hrs of usage and to top it off the boat support is being handled by idiots who say that battery damage isnt covered under warranty even when i mentioned this is a new earphone hardly used for a week the answer is same so just stay away from boat products however lucrative the deal might be
5602,3.0,when i first saw this shirt online i was so excited it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous its fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy i love the navycream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well and the buttons are cute too when i put it on it was so comfortable but it made me look like i was pregnant especially from the side it just
5603,4.0,the overall quality is great and it can charge devices at a time and as compared to the other power banks in the market in this price bracket this is the best and the cons in this product is the the provided usb cable is not that great and it has a micro usb port but i have to say this is the best product which i saved me for like many times in this price bracket thumbs up for this overall a great product
5604,2.0,ii buy gb ram but it is ded slow like bg ram
5605,1.0,network issues voice issues and no returns and all this stared after d repalcement window closed so a phone gets bad in days its very very sad
5606,5.0,walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one the color is advertised as grey but its actually more like a light mocha the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender i generally wear a size and m or l size tops depending on the designer i purchased the l in this case because thats all that was available at
5607,5.0,awsm led tv and sound was vry good and feel like android phone
5608,5.0,worth spending money
5609,1.0,dont buy as its a refurbished product within one year sent it to service center to get the motherboard replaced
5610,2.0,definitely agree with the other reviewers this top looks great on the model but pretty bad in real life super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs if you plan on ordering id recommend sizing down
5611,4.0,i just got this shirt the other day and already love it it fits like a basic tee but the details on the sleeves and back are really cute the shape is loose at the bottom which makes this really comfortable my only complaint is its a little tight across the back but this does not hurt the overall fit and comfort of the top this is a little thicker than a tee shirt too so the quality feels nice
5612,3.0,this is such a beautiful top with pretty vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong the front is fine the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out i got an xxsp lbs so couldnt size down please retailer no more billowy tops so sad to have to return this one

5615,4.0,ilove it just be careful when telling it to play music on prime you may be charged
5616,3.0,it does run large as most reviewers noted i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and im only a b cup it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd the length of the petite was good for me at only so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide love the fabric and the lace at the hemline it just wasnt for me but for those it works for it is be
5617,4.0,love the product hate the packaging the product clumps up beneath the opening so it wont close properly i do really like the product i have used a lot of curling creams and this one is definitely my favorite i have thick wavy hair and this makes it really soft and also shiny i rub a small amount between my palms and scrunch it in my towel dry hair and repeat this a few times and let it air dry or use a diffuser it doesnt do much against frizz though
5618,4.0,as one would expect from boucle this sweater is incredibly soft warm and cozy without being heavy i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color its beautiful goes with casual and work clothing belt helps with the latter styling and it didnt leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs with sleeves being a bit long i hope it wont stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do thats my o
5619,3.0,only brand image better to move good mobile and advance technology in this cost
5620,3.0,i liked the over all performance of the mobile but the phone gets heated if more apps are used at once also to mention it gets charged pretty quick but also gets heated at the time of charging i didnt have to charge the phone much often because it didnt require that much charging thanks to its monster capacity battery life the phone is bit heavy compared to my previous phone and is wide it plays p videos on youtube had a good time watching movies series and playing pubg also it didnt consume that much of battery while playing games pubg i would suggest people to buy gb because the picture quality is good and also shoots good slowmotion videos for which memory would be needed also finger print sensor and face detection works best in this phone its has samoled display which gives hd display pros good battery life camera quality reare as well as front good gaming experience fingerprint reader face reader samoled display sar is less than wkg good mobile look it has dolby atmos so good speaker quality it has screen mirroring cons gets heated while charging gets heated when more apps are open heavy in weight

5641,2.0,crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around the waist section where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and didnt lay well i am lbs c waist and hip usually wear a or extra small in the maeve clothing that isnt a fitted style i bought the s which fit well except for the waist issue described above this is a fitted dress i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received it is a great style idea
5642,3.0,the blouse looked better on the model i liked the way it fit just not how it looks the fabric made me itch which was one of the other reasons i returned it i wished it had looked good and the fabric didnt make me itch i really liked the unique look to the shirt
5643,2.0,if you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest this is the one for you i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition but this one did not do it for me i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy
5644,5.0,excellent tv with k pictute quality and mainly sound awesome many more thanks much
5645,5.0,this micro card works well with my go pro hero does what you would expect a micro sd card to do
5646,5.0,i tried this dress on in the store but decided to think about it because of price i ended up buying it later on line i usually wear a medium lbs wide shoulders but got a small in this dress it does run the risk of looking like a sack but sizing down did the trick the easy going loosness yet elegance is why i like it it is so comfy but looks lucious i plan to wear it often this fall and christmas
5647,1.0,dont buy if u are looking features phone only camera my rating no good as it should be missing many things like call recording option saving contact on simphonegoogle option full screen mode missing connection speed missing unable to star favorite sms no gallery app only google photos

5651,2.0,this is an oil on the heavier side feels like oil amp silicone combined smells great but have to be careful of the amount u use or else it sits in your hair ends makes ur hair appear wet i prefer lighter hair oils that absorb well into hair this also does not really visibly tame my hair or softenshine it wouldnt repurchase
5652,5.0,anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down i have to buy it fit is always so flattering comfy and the prints are always great
5653,2.0,product is good but volume key was broken when we opened the box

5657,5.0,this dress is fun and flattering love the pieced denim look and the aline style unlike other reviewers i found this dress to be true to size for my pearshaped figure the length is long enough to wear anywhere and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures
5658,5.0,i disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online i received a lot of compliments when i wore it i wore it with black skinny jeans black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket and did not keep on the entire night i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in i really love it maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change
5659,4.0,speaker loud but quality below average and battery medium user day uses
5660,4.0,after using since last months i am writing this review really it is amazing to experience using shinco tv very great tv in this price range picture quality has to be improved a little thanks to shinco and amazon to availing this good product to customers
5661,4.0,i ordered this dress in the black motif and a petite size the color is slightly more washed out than depicted probably because of the stretchy fabric used but it is still nice the dress does run large the length is a bit too long and the pockets which i was surprised were even there are several inches too low for my frame overall though this will be a good dress for hot summer days and should travel well i wish the blue floral one was available when i ordered this dress as it looks
5662,2.0,book is excellent and uses very simple english but i was shocked that pages were missing
5663,2.0,i like the product but after days it got hung and no display i went to nokia care its days and no reply its bad experience
5664,5.0,i got the purple and its a lovely muted purple almost lavender nice quality flattering i recently had a baby so this is a nice shirt to hide my wobbly bits id recommend to anyone with or without wobbly bits
5665,2.0,i wanted to love this kimonoit is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabricnot a soft touch and because it runs small i bought the ml and usually wear a but i couldnt bring the kimono together in the front for a belting option
5666,5.0,first i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic but actually im glad i didnt know because i love it it does not look cheap and it really works the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough the real issue for me is the size i ordered the small and it is huge enormous especially from the back the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so its almost a bat wing kind of thing and
5667,2.0,lets talk about the big elephant in the roomfor one this brand is anything but organic the play on the word quotorganicsquot is very misleading and apparently the lessthanstellar reviews seem to accurately reflect the quality of the quotpure and simplequot products by quotorganixquot well now its been changed to ogx i have low porosity ca hair and my biggest issue is chronic dryness in fairness i purchased just the shampoo and it was average usually the results are better in conjunction to using with the conditioner but its not so much that the product quotdried outquot my hair or quotdamagedquot itit just did nothing for me the smell is disturbingly artificial similar to synthetic soap with a subtle hint of mint maybe tea tree i dont know and you would think that an ingredients such as peppermint and tea tree are sustainable and relatively cheap essential oils im baffled as to why i cant even detect it in the shampoo overall this shampoo is an overhyped generic shampoo that doesnt deliver on their promises the only positive feedback i can give for this subpar product is that their bottle designs are cute and it didnt quotdamage or dryquot my hair
5668,3.0,this phone has very poor fingerprint reader average touch screen but camera is good as well as battery life most annoying thing in this phone is it pops up so many advertisements when unlocking the phone inspite of blocking those from settings
5669,4.0,i am writing this review after using it for a month continuously everything thing in this band is just amazing the only flaws are the battery and screen quality they claim that it has days battery life but it doesnt even go up to days and the screen is pretty bright untill you go out in the sunlight its barely visible and for the durability it is really durable like really good and it is also waterproof ive done the test if you can ignore those two flaws youll not be disappointed as for the money you spent
5670,4.0,really good mobile at reasonable rate works smoothly battery life is awesome
5671,5.0,i love this tshirt it is so soft fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors
5672,1.0,the phone seems to be heavily discounted here isnt that an indication that theres something fishythese iphones are refurbished sold as brand newthey are pretty used hence they are sold at such a discounted priceif you dont believe me go through the one star reviews and see theyll be many complains as regards the box being opened or the documentation being missing
5673,5.0,lap seems sooper smooth while initial setup doesnt felt any lag issue like other people claim in their review not much satisfied about battery life thats y giving star bt overall it is the best one available in market for this price range i opt to purchase this one after days of enquiries and web searches it doesnt make me disappointed thanks to amazone in hp support found it is a genuine lappy review after months i just gave one more star and now it is star overall pefomance is awesome only one problem when creating new folder it lags ore few sec those who felt the system is slow kindly uninstall useless preinstalled softwares especially mcafee antivirus and install avast free or any other antivirus now your problem solved u can have a sooper smooth lappy enjoy
5674,4.0,absolutely love the sound quality and construction two issues that seem almost unbelievable that they would have overlooked among all the verbal notifications it gives it gives no warning or notification when the device is fully charged second when more than one bluetooth device is connected the one not being listened to causes sound breakup and disruption when applications are being used on the nonlistened to device only option is to not pair more than one device at a time
5675,1.0,i am advising please dont take this mobile at any all after the one month of usage the mobile started getting hanged
5676,3.0,the seller was rude and in a hurry still new to this phone its works just fine just feels weird without the touch sensor
5677,2.0,heres my first impression will provide detailed review later on wall charger is not included as part of the product if you need a dedicated plug to charge this speaker you need to shell out another rs for buying the plug separately plug is not part the product info is conveniently left out of the specs and not mentioned about the charging plug not being part of the deal i am definitely not amused with such shady sales approach
5678,3.0,love the print length and cut but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while sad to return it
5679,2.0,does not even connect with amazon prime doesnt do things as expected
5680,3.0,its good for the prize
5681,3.0,tried on this maxi dress recently hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin so sad unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back
5682,4.0,amazing performance superb camera super smooth display
5683,3.0,phone is ok but overpriced and not value for money product disappointed
5684,4.0,super cute shirt really flowy on the bottom good if you want to hide your middle great quality material
5685,2.0,lovey top in the photos however its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger im lbs c generally wear xs or s in retailer tops ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering the lace work is so pretty it has potential but the design doesnt work well for some
5686,5.0,flattering fit true to size i ordered which fit perfectly i am lbs wish it came in off whitesand and black great with boots and more substantial than some leggings also extremely comfy
5687,3.0,average
5688,5.0,new samsung galaxy m item is as describe on listing delivery on time as committed do not know about battery life yet delivery agent was very polite and calm thank you subhash kodinariya
5689,1.0,my wifes razr m has been a great phone to date i matched it with what i thought would be a great memory card having been a long time sandisk ultra user in my photographysadly after months without warning the card mysteriously bricked unreadable by her phone two pcs and one mac the only thing that can even see the card is my droid bionic which says the card is unreadable and needs to be formatted i am hesitant in the very odd chance i can still recover the many gigs of photos and videos of our month old baby which were not backed upi could not be any more disappointed in this product
5690,4.0,this is a very stylish casual top it fits great i plan on wearing it with a long sleeve black tshirt underneath or black turtleneck i absolutely love the crochet detail at the bottom
5691,4.0,a great skinny jean these grey beauties are flattering and light weight they fit true to size but seems a bit on the long side bunching oddly at the ankle when wearing them with booties hopefully they hold up to some heavy wear
5692,1.0,this is the worst shampoo ive used in my entire life id give it negative five stars if i could i normally have healthy shiny beautiful hair but this shampoo made it disgustingly greasy and waxy especially at the roots my hair was falling out by the fistful and had become impossible to style it felt like i had put effing glue in my hair thankfully apple cider vinegar fixed everything but i will never spend my money on organix anything again seriously horrible product dont buy it
5693,5.0,i was looking for the full legged pants with a slit light enough for the beach they have my size finally im a regular and m worked well for me cant wait to wear these with a nice top
5694,5.0,perfect for small family genuine product with manufacturer warranty i wish to give star good product in budget
5695,4.0,comfy gauzy tee that has lovely lace detailing the white is totally see through just fyi i dont think its the best quality but totally worth the sale price i got the m and its loose and flowy in a good way
5696,2.0,i was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big if you are normally a size i wouldnt bother with these
5697,2.0,it is costlier as for as its size and quality is concerneddont buy itit is foolish to buy a tiny speaker spending rs u had better buy a zebronics or intex spending rs only and u will get speakers k rajesh
5698,1.0,mast products

5717,3.0,i have been using this product for days now and this product turned out to be a mix bag pro battery life is too good screen resolution and color quality is awesome at it is one of the best phones with advance features con the back cover is cheap plastic when u press the sides it seems loose the phone is quite heavy when u are holding from the sides while watching any video it opens command boxes which is irritating and ruin the fun the volume on max is too load and volume one point lower from the highest is too low

5734,4.0,this is one of the best mi phone in this price range because of its camera quality the selfie camera is just beyond expectation while the only thing i didnt liked is the packaging as the phone box was not covered with bubble wrap as i think it should be well except that everything is great you will get a mi charger with usb cable and a key with this phone the colour i ordered was blue and that is so beautiful as the back portion is totally reflecting and you can see your face in that so its a great advantage for girls

5743,2.0,when system is turned on it takes much time say mins to turn on provided that i have installed minimal softwares and restart of system requires more than hr stating that all the updates are running in the background sql server will be the only heavy weight software installed and more than gb of hard disk is free win preinstalled i th gen processor does anyone face the same issue
5744,1.0,like i said in my shampoo review i bought this because of the buy one get one free deal at my riteaid this conditioner really sounded appealing after reading the back label about how moisturizing it is and after i smelled it i was sold too bad it didnt perform i was expecting a nice rich thick conditioner that conditioned my badly damaged hair sadly it didnt it actually made my hair feel like straw it didnt smooth it down or nourish it in anyway i was really lured by the scent it is so delicious smelling but i rather condition my hair in something that smells worse and works great rather than the opposite this product reminds me of those v conditioners that they used to sell not sure if they still sell that brand somewhere but i remember seeing them on the shelves for like cents or cents a piece at walmart they definately performed cheap although this brand has organic ingredients and is supposedly natural it is pretty bad aubrey organics definately out performs this by a long shot will not repurchase
5745,1.0,hzjxnx
5746,5.0,saw this in the store in pinkvery cool dress but i want black so im ordering it the fabric was almost lacelike it comes w a slip it was sort of swingy and designed to be aline loved it the bell sleeves totally make it
5747,4.0,be aware that this cardigan runs small as you can see on the model its a formfitting style its not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece i would wear it more like a top with a buttonup front it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design im not wowed by it but its nice in a s kind of way
5748,2.0,touch screen is not good
5749,1.0,all the shampoos of this brand are by far the oiliest and greasiest i have ever encountered in the shower i washed my hair with a clarifying shampoo after washing it with this one and it still made me breakout everywhere returned all the rest of the products of the organix brand
5750,4.0,i ordered the xl in the green motif the shirt is fitted through the body im a pearshape so its tight around my hips its cut straight down ill need to wear this tucked in or belt itpull it up a bit closer to my waistline so its more comfortable the colors pattern in the green motif are prettier in person i love orange roses havent found any shirt or dress with orange roses before so i kept it i used my birthday discount to splurge on this i think its overpriced for what it i
5751,3.0,the battery gets discharged very fast display not up to the mark
5752,4.0,this top would be perfect if not for the large gap in the front where it wraps the hook and loop just do not work to keep the top closed love the pink color and the fit otherwise i am almost always a medium but the small was perfect for me for reference lbs dd
5753,2.0,volume control and power buttons are not working how to fix it who can help me on this issue
5754,4.0,the colors are amazing the fabric is beautiful my only complaint is the cut i am lb and always a medium i put the sweater on and the armhole area was short so it kept riding up it almost fit like a petite with the higher cut in waist tailoring i liked the sweater color and fabric so much i exchanged for a large
5755,5.0,this top is soft feeling and i appreciate that its lined its light weight and feminine but no camisole is needed when you take it off the shoulder area feels tight so you need to be a little gentle but its gorgeous and you should get it im a c and i got a
5756,2.0,i thought this was adorable on the model but not so much on me i actually didnt mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan but i didnt want to keep it for look the material felt inexpensive the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself im and about lbs
5757,4.0,this dress is lovely i am athletic and busty ddd but not super slim so not easy to petite items that fit in the chestarms i ordered pm which usually works and it was actually too big in the chest im waiting on the ps but think it will work since the cut is generous materialitem is so lovely and comfortable i never have extra chest room so this was such a great surprise hope the ps is great but think it will be unless they went crazy on making it to small
5758,2.0,im so upset that this didnt work out im petite at and ordered this skirt in petite however i felt like it swallowed me up the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire im the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing but on me i feel like a schoolmarm sadly this is going back
5759,5.0,i like that i can wear this over anything only drawback is that its shortsleeved so it semidefeats the purpose of having a cardigan but its so pretty i cant return it
5760,1.0,i put this new sd card in my new gs for the first time and now the metal contacts are scratched and it randomly unmounts from the phone my older gb sandisk works just fine so im thinking its the thicker paint or something causing this i dont know but its ruined it scratched the first day but im just now noticing the unmounts now that i have my music on it every few songs it will unmount and remount interupting my music ill never buy another expensive sandisk im going to order a different brand just make sure i can find one without paint on it sucks i really thought this was going to be a good one i love the colors and its so fast to transfer files to too bad its broken and i didnt find out about it until after the return date so im screwed oh well never again ill give my business to someone else
5761,1.0,the battery mah not satisfactory it acts as mah battery it not come even onedayoutoff gb ram gb used mobile inernal apps the signal grasping also very least it shows single point other maxpro m shows points the phone also getting heat if we used more than one hour the camera quality is not fulfilled as per specification any video watching suddenly jump to front it is not a good phone
5762,5.0,i love this jumpsuit i ordered it unsure but i am so glad i did it is super comfy and fit perfectly i loved the lengthcan dress up or down it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked trim my mom friends and complete strangers complimented me when i wore thisand thats when you know you scored
5763,5.0,super phone i am loving it i have used it for around days now and i have found great battery life screen is the best and the camera what to say so good i have changed from redmi note pro to this and i am loving my decision typing on this is so nice best phone and the soc i have checked is on power with sd so gaming also good
5764,3.0,battery life not good
5765,2.0,maybe i shouldnt have sized up to an xl but im not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit the vee is quite low and im busty itll be really low if youre smaller on top the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me not tight at all its almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view i looked like a really wide green apple i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldnt recommend it
5766,2.0,cant figure out how to hook it up please call me
5767,1.0,the product delivered is defectiveno pre despatch quality check was carried outhae requested to return or replacement of product
5768,5.0,amazing dths will be past this is thw future
5769,2.0,ok so first things first some of the reviews on here are for the shampoo conditioner or other products in the range this is for the day smooth treatment secondly unlike others i did follow the full guidance for this treatment most importantly i used a straightening iron that actually went up to the specified temperature my hair is a mixture of b and c curls with normal porosity and normal elasticity medium coarse texture it is just past jaw length just above shoulder i have had bkts in the past but they are no longer in my hair i blow dry and straighten my hair regularly i bought this product on a whim and did not expect it to give me full salon results however did expect more i washed and clarified with the provided shampoo then left my hair to dry til dry the product is ml however you dont need the full bottle to ensure i got a really smooth even coating on my hair without applying too much product i applied it by dipping a very fine tooth comb into the solution wiping off some of the excess and then combing it from root to tip through my hair this method allowed for each strand to be lightly coated however any excess came off on the comb using this method i used just over half the bottle i then blow dried and straightened running the iron through small sections at least times people have complained about the smell i noticed a chocolatey cocoa smell and a lot of steam coming off when i was doing it my hair got so hot that i could not touch each section with bare hands after running the iron over it i used the babylis curl and straight on full power c f once the ironing was finished i was left with heavy coated hair then began the torture of the hour wait my hair didnt look really greasy however it definitely did not look clean at all i avoided getting my hair wet and made sure i ran over it with the irons after sleeping to get any kinks out i think that the feeling is partly because it is top heavy with cocoa butter and the result well after hours i was desperate to get the evil gunk out of my hair after washing it out with a sulfate free and sodium chloride free shampoo and conditioner kirkland hydrating i towel dried at this point i would say that about of my curl was gone however of the frizz was gone the manufacturers state that it cuts drying time by however i have not even noticed that it has cut it down by i have waited another week before writing this review to see how i get on with it and have to say i am not impressed whilst i never expected it to be the same result as a salon bkt i am disappointed that it has taken out my curl but left me with frizz i would have preferred to have had curl but less frizz wouldnt we all i still spend the same length of time drying and flat ironing and havent noticed any benefits at all finally the overall condition and texture of my hair has not been improved at all in fact i would say that i have had an increase in damage split ends and dryness
5770,5.0,i bought this mobile for price from the great indian sale in fact at this price better features are found the camera finger lock face lock and battery life work very well all i can say is that the perfect smartphone for a middle class man can buy comfortably i am happy thanks
5771,5.0,nice mobile in low budgets
5772,3.0,wanted to love this dress as its perfect for transition im a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it i would implore the maker to try this style again as its a good one unfortunately the sizing was its downfall
5773,3.0,i wanted this top in a petite xs but it was sold out so i got the xs im with a b bust and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model the sleeves are a bit longthey seem a little long on the model too i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day really like the tie neck feature though
5774,5.0,cool beans if you do not need sound quality and have limited space this is the way to go everything alexa can do in a mini hockey puck size package at a mini price
5775,3.0,it should be glass or metal body instead of plastic body
5776,5.0,sound quality and picture quality is good hotstar amazon prime and netflix as inbuilt apps
5777,2.0,product is good when its working properly its anoying when it kept on shutting down itself or taking a while to process kinda of disappointed at how buggy it is
5778,5.0,i am really enjoying the dot along with my echo i would like to get a few more to place around the house thumbs up for me
5779,4.0,i am happy with this product must buy
5780,5.0,everything that you need to have in the iphone is awesome
5781,3.0,well not worth it cons if you are expecting that once you buy a kindle you may get ebooks free atleast few then forget it not everyone likes to read ramayana or mahabharat all the time there is something called kindle unlimited for month where they say you can get lots of books for free well it provides access to only common books which you would easily find in stores for rs book less if rented after purchase i got a promotional offer months of kindle unlimited at just rupees after whit it gets auto renewal at month guess what i cannot pay with debit cards or amazon pay balance only credit cards where amazon is able to deduct money automatically they say its for hazzle free renewal no benefit to prime members classic books titles are not available not even paid there is no option for user support interface is soooooooooo laggy that you will find a second delay in every function even in zooming or scrolling touch responds literally a second late battery they say that it lasts for a week funny it is even written in home screen when u switch it on mine lasted for roughly hours on time in total even a rs tablet will last that much when we switch of the internet and remove sim card the book files format it uses is not pdf something else and when u see it via computer you can see each book is a folder with multiple file obviously rd party softwares are available than can convert pdf into kindle redable formats but if i had to go for that much trouble i would have stick to good old cheap tablets it can open pdfs but believe me it is painfully slow you will appreciate your grandfathers old computer more than kindle you will have to transfer it via cable from pc it has browser but no download option pros screen is different than usual smartphone screen its uses external illumination to display so it feels like u are seeing paper so less to no stress to eyes comparison with tablets of equivalent price kindle has monochromatic screen not ambient light sensor no os interface is painfully slow touch is week screen resolution poor pathetic refresh rate not even autobrightness control in case of backlight tablet i have everything
5782,3.0,camera gets hang each time i take pics and its very frequent
5783,5.0,best camera and battery in this price stylish look fast fingerprint scanner face unlock ignore negative reviewsblindly go fo it

5788,3.0,nice book first few pages are really boring but page after page the interest grew more
5789,5.0,i must politely disagree with the previous review i hesitated to order this item based on the reviewer below and i am happy to say this item is everything i hoped it would be it looks exactly like the picture fit color quality being a silk top i believe this item was priced appropriately and the quality of the item does not disappoint the pom poms are colorful and bright but not the least bit juvenile this top is light and flowy yet flattering for hot humid summer days i will look for
5790,4.0,lovely feel to this almostcowl neck turtleneck its quite thin and has length sleeves so it wont keep you warm but the fabric is soft the ribbing is flattering and the fit is loose without feeling frumpy overall a good staple thats a bit more interesting the mauveish color looks great with grays
5791,4.0,love this top a little heavy but looks great with shorts or white jeans
5792,4.0,speaking about the plus point the display is fantastic the color contrast is good and the touch feel is good the battery backup is good it lasts for almost days quick charging is really effective now speaking about the lagging part poor low light photography front camera is not good
5793,4.0,picture quality is awesomebattery life is gooddont listen other about battery life who except battery life of mah in mah mobilebest mobile with android one in this budget
5794,1.0,this dress will unfortunately be returnedso cute online and looks like a sack in person runs very large arm holes are very low not flattering
5795,5.0,a must read book which makes u commute through all kind of emotions from love to deathand from failure to success
5796,2.0,this dress looks great online with boots as shown when it arrived and i tried it on it fit great on my arms wasnt too tight on my neck but once it went down over my chest c the dress never came back in to show my feminine waistshape it just looked like a big trash bag on me very disappointing similar to a mumu
5797,1.0,less than phone has stopped working completely
5798,4.0,proximity sensor has some issueswhile on call it gets interrupted due to phone goingbinto flight mode or something like that due to contact with earcamera is goodbattery life is decent
5799,3.0,i knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was months pregnanti even bought a small even though i normally wear medium i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in weeks it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works
5800,5.0,i had been to the retailer store several times in hopes in finding the perfect top for my upcoming reunion as soon as i saw this i knew it was perfect for the occasion im sure ill get a lot of use out of this top as you can dress it up or down
5801,5.0,if you know oneseptember and you know whats good for you then size the heck down maybe even two sizes if your particularly slim or want the dress to fit tighter any way this dress is simply scrumptious the embroidery at the bodice is so detailed and pretty the layers are light and soft like silk but its rayonpoly and the sleeves are sheer and voluminous i actually prefer the sleeves rolled up because they are too long neckline features a slitv with two hooks to close if wanted co
5802,3.0,dont follow it completely
5803,4.0,keratin oil shampoo by organix containskeratin and argan oil it leaves the hair smoother and thicker they are super shinny too love it
5804,5.0,got this because i had a gb one that filled up i kept getting the insufficient disk space on my phone my kids take my phone and do selfies mostly my daughter i had to get a bigger card the gb one was a carry over from an old phoneneedless to say this was sweet plenty of space and i dont have to delete pictures anymore well for now at leastmy daughter loves selfies
5805,3.0,i buy with good exchange offer
5806,4.0,best smart phone with two g sim supported and external micro sd card slot
5807,1.0,i am using this from past mon and i am already regretting why did i purchase itlot of bugs impacts performance too costlyiphone s is far better than this in all means
5808,3.0,have not had much time to use it but so far its fun
5809,2.0,i just received this in the mail today first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer the description says viscose lining so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color second of all it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said i ordered a size smaller than us
5810,2.0,no earphone delivery in box
5811,5.0,overall very good phone with stock android but batterie not lasts for a day
5813,5.0,good battery life and better vision

5815,5.0,very good product worth for money paid
5816,4.0,love that alexa is in my life now however my living room is rather larger and sometimes she doesnt hear me correctly i mainly use the voice command feature to set the house security system and the weather
5817,2.0,the sound is poor compared to alexa
5818,1.0,this phone goes through a lot of problems like overheating slow charging battery draining isssue is my one of the biggest problem with this phone and i am considering not to buy it youll get another one with thus budget
5819,5.0,very useful around the house going to pickup more alexa unabled devices like a nest and lighting
5820,1.0,phone is just heating problem
5821,1.0,beware guys i bought one of these from superior electronics outlet and it arrived completly dead i tried to format it on windows and on my galaxy s and no goi tried everything that possible have been fighting with this card for days now and no success so far no response from the seller about itmy last hope is amazon refund me otherwise i just wasted u
5822,1.0,hate it it thinks someone is saying alexa when no one is saying anything
5823,1.0,damaged product delivered
5824,3.0,im torn i find my hair is shiny and more tame when using this it does feel soft but i really am not a fan of the smell and my hair gets very greasy fast with it i use this with the matching conditioner and am not sure which one if not both is too heavy for my hair might try one of the coconut ones from this brand next would not repurchase
5825,5.0,its been a month using this phone lt has smooth use experience it never lags or any kind of performance issueworth buying
5826,4.0,good watch nice working battery backup so good
5827,5.0,i absolutely love these pants i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper ive always liked the look of these pants but didnt think i had the body type to pull them off being with some curves i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips the draping isnt as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didnt add weight to my frame the mate
5828,4.0,very nice product sound quality is fine n loud for home purpose also voice assistance feature is good seamless connection between mobile n speaker via bluetooth
5829,5.0,love this dress it fits perfectly is flattering and the fabric is high quality i ordered the blue print and it is a vibrant turquoise i may order in the charcoal as well as this is a comfortable cute dress for everyday casual i am lbs and the size was perfect even a tad bit loose but i prefer a bit loose to tight especially with the design with the buttons up the front
5830,4.0,the first unit i received had the dreaded defect where it would disconnect then reconnect which was super annoying sandisk has a very nice online warranty software in place and since it was a known issue they were speedy with a replacement the new unit works perfectly and provides plenty of space as a manufacture it was nice to be treated as i treat my customers from such a larger company
5831,4.0,still learning the correct phrases to talk to it but works good linked up to dish tv with no problem change channels on command
5832,5.0,it is a little pricey for what it is but i love it so much that i am keeping it i am normally size and the s fits great the rope straps are just adorable
5833,3.0,its a perfectly cute simple summer dress but the only reason im even considering keeping it is because it was a gift the material is fine but for this price i expect something more exciting than what is really just a modified tshirt dress at least more exciting colors or a print or something the top piece is full layers which could get warm in the summer and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if youre smallchested im a b and super thin and still neede
5834,3.0,good sound clarity pairing is easy only problem is it gives echo to people on the other end of the line when on a phone call other than that a great product i am using it in our office for conference calls works nicely until the echo comes echo does not come always it comes once in calls
5835,4.0,the only problem i had was with the tinney sounding speaker i paired the dot to a jbl clip speaker and it now sounds fine
5836,3.0,this is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great unless you move in it the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights only a little but just enough to make it annoying if you have any jiggle at all id steer clear would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas
5837,4.0,no need to mention any comment as the brand says everything about the phone
5838,3.0,this vest is very nice and fashionable very stylish i like it a lot however it is too itchy the opening in the front didnt allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold however the itchiness is too much i dont wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere so i could not imaging wearing this vest it is too itchy why ruin such a good thing

5843,2.0,finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed i am swimming in the xs lbs the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics the green is a bright kelly green the red is much more red than rust colored etc and its a sweater coat for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality i dont doubt that it will be warm but cant justify the price its going back to the store

5856,2.0,the bottom part of this romper is easy to put on but the top is very poorly designed it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear once i got it on it fit perfectly though getting out of it was a disaster i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip overall i was crushed that it didnt work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering

5858,2.0,i grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress and it left me puzzled the print was pretty but no amount of tailoring could save it for me it was wearing me maybe it could wear three of me i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners by making a garment without details no installing more time consuming zippers buttons or snaps and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it

5865,3.0,the one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets one was regular heightt eh other was so low i could barely put my hand in it however the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft color is nice but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me i tried on the xs but that was big i would need xxs p if it was made in that size so i let it go looked nice with pinched fabric in the back for reference i am lbs dd in waist

5882,1.0,be warned there is not even a single email id that you can contact apple directly to register a complaint only call them up or chat no escalation matrix and not even in their website they have displayed the warranty conditions of their services in india so if by any chance you get a faulty device after spending all this money on it you are stuck with it they have stopped replacing devices with hardware malfunction manufacturing defect and just sending you back refurbished ones that too within the warranty period i bought a gb iphone on aprilnd and immediately noticed the poor quality of pictures taken outdoors in the evening also the amount of grains in the screen even in low resolution was shocking even after multiple upgradation of software no resolution was found and after the apple care ran remote disgnostics the phone was hanging and ended up dead even prior to this my phone was force closing apps and getting stuck with the screen in some apps like facebook i finally went back to the customer care centre for the rd time and told them that the phone died after remote diagniostics had run and they said its a usual issue you just have to press the lower volume button and the power button and it will turn on i then asked how come even after they had replaced the software manually one week back i was still having issues with the phone hanging and poor quality photos and urged them to check it in detail they finally sent it to apple care in bangalore where they found fault in the camera and screen and wihtout replacing the phone just changed those parts and sent it back to me did that atleast solve my issue it did not in low light conditions the pictures taken are worser than even a mp camera from the cheapest price range its terrible that after spending k on a high end phone all you get is an extremely poor phone with even worse support from apple they are just trying to provide second grade phones in countries with no stringent consumer protection laws and dont even show their warranty conditions in their local website i did the mistake of buying one without checking all these out thinking its such a reputed brand but its not please check the fb page for apple even the usa page has more than all the rest combined

5991,3.0,my observations after days of use though the product is light weight and very compact but there is huge overheating problem within an hour of use the area around mouse pad gets overheated sound quality is okay i am using it for some application only and that too without office so cant comment on the speed overall with these specifications the price i bought this laptop at was too good to be true but it has its own issues
5992,2.0,only battery is good rest of all things are worst camera quality is low when compared with similar featured phones motion guesters are not working properly talk back services are working worst just after using for weeks phone got hanged when i want to open gpay even though i am using gb ram phone really disappointed with ms
5993,5.0,echo is great
5994,2.0,i really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person the yellow looks dirty in real life not pretty like the picture it is also a strange fitshape when it is on i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all
5995,4.0,so this shirt is very cute i like the drape if you can get it arranged properly but it is not black more of a charcoal bordering on heathered navy i wear all black so it quite obviously stands out as a different color in my closet i am keeping it thinking i will wear it with leather since it is flattering and the keyhole is something different i am a true medium and bought the medium and it fits fine a little shorter in the back but not a deal breaker
5996,2.0,the volume button doesnt work in the device i got and so does the power button provided okla speed test shows the internet speed for my connection at mbps for both download and upload but yet the videos buffer when i watch it in my tv netflix youtube have severe buffering issues and the video automatically recedes to p or lower resolution at times connectivity issues were also seen though these were not that frequent voice recognition works good but overall the entire purpose of getting the firestick is defeated if it is unable to stream at higher resolution even when the bandwidth is sufficiently high alternatively you have to make use of your tv remote for volume adjustments since the volume button given doesnt function
5997,3.0,beautiful dress good quality tts im feet lbs ordered my small petite no issues however the green is very bright the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks baristas apron its going back i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress its a yes
5998,4.0,picture quality is good k videos looks great sound is loud but quality is average additional speakers or soundbar are required very old brand and now taken over by panasonic installation and customer service is prompt and responds immediately ips panel in this price range is a wow factor completely made in india in andhrapradesh no amazon prime certified android tv
5999,3.0,product was good but the size was small compared to what i expected amazing product good audio quality and fm was good
6000,1.0,i really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this dress it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on i ordered the smmed and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said are you kidding me by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look lbs heavier horrible design retailer i dont know which dress the
6001,3.0,phone getting over heat within sort usage like upto minutes
6002,3.0,super cute skirt i decided to return it because i felt like i didt have enough tops to go with it
6003,5.0,most of the knowledge or information or method is only valid with american systemits very difficult but not impossible to replicate in india
6004,4.0,good product at this price i like this
6005,4.0,good budget phone have been using it for months now pros good battery life good camera for the price sleak design cons face recognition does not work all the time but responsive of time scope for improvement finger print scanner also has a scope for improvement but responsive most of the time audio quality on speaker is average overall a great phone for the price if you are looking for a stylish budget smartphone this is your thing go for it
6006,4.0,good quality sound easy portable packaging not good
6007,5.0,i loved this dress so much i got it in colors i had to send it back twice to get the size right i ended up with a medium the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival it is dryclean only overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute
6008,5.0,i tried this on as a fluke i work at retailer and like to see the fit of everything so i can talk about it with customers it is so chic it makes your butt look amazing i tried it on with nude booties but i could also see it with a great heeled sandal or flats dont overlook this beauty
6009,5.0,theres no doubt that this tee is sheer i found that a nude bra is sufficient in overcoming the issue the fit is true to size with just enough room for drape without being too oversized the beachy theme will be perfect come warm weather
6010,3.0,product is ok usb cable coming with thia product is not good in built quality but charging efficiency is good i can charge timez
6011,2.0,soooo disappointed in this dress the colors are beautiful for fall the fabric feels luxe the slip fits perfectly the dress however is a hot mess it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flowy aline dress huge everywhere under the arms and waist and hips its just an enormous tent i am lbs i ordered my usual size small i looked shapeless in this i cant think of any body type it would flatter potentially women quite far along in their pregnancy
6012,5.0,nice addition to my home
6013,1.0,used for two months in samsung galaxy fizzled then failed i have never experienced a memory card or or flash drive failure until this sandisk ultra gb will purchase a different brand next time return for refund or replacement is not allowed
6014,3.0,well that was indeed a gd buk bt i ddnt like few boring traces underneath d story otherwise its a gd story
6015,1.0,camera quality is big disappointment in this phone dont buy
6016,3.0,recommend this vest nice design fabric is thicker than expected might suggest a size smaller plenty of room in loose styling
6017,1.0,even dont deserve any star worst phonesound quality is not that much good worst part is screenshot and u have to buy bluetooth earphones and slow battery charging very bad battery backup within days the cable which they provide to connect earphone stopped working dont go for this phone it is really very very worst product
6018,5.0,good quality and smooth transaction
6019,2.0,not a good phone overall as per the configuration its not up to the users expectation the voice is too bad when the other person listens to it while talking
6020,4.0,love this conditioner its quite light but still works well great fragrance a bit pricy but lasts me awhile as i only wash every four days id definitely get this again
6021,4.0,love it but it shrank and that makes me so mad
6022,4.0,good mobilebut its ram rom are very low as operating system itself is taking a lot of memory storage so it getting hang while opening two three apps together anyway in this price range it is ok
6023,2.0,it doesnt recognise the face properly battery life is good camera also not very good
6024,3.0,this is a truly beautiful dress and yes so much better in person upon examining the dress however i saw some problems the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places there were some frayed ends and even some fuzzy spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something the dress is over and for that price i expect the embroidery to be topnotch returning and hope the replacement is in better shape if so it will be a keeper
6025,2.0,i had high hopes this would work for me i have unevenly wavy hair that is very thick so i wanted to make it more manageable and hopefully be able to let it air dry i followed directions however my iron only went up to and it has ceramic plates i have a suspicion that this simply wont work well with the product and thats why i had a disappointing experience it lightened the dyed portion of my hair a few shades my hair also feels very dry which is a shame because i felt as though it had finally healed from the dying i stopped a few months ago the smell was pretty bad but mostly because i got sick of it at least it smells kind of like perfume so i hope i didnt bother anyone at work during the days i had it in i never thought i would make the days without washing but i did the second day isnt as bad as you might imagine the straightening results my hair dries the same way it always did disappointing however it dries faster with my blow dryer and there are slightly less kinks when i flat iron i do find that my hair is now more impressionable for example if i pin my bangs up and i want them back down i have to strait iron them or else they will want to stand up same goes for putting my hair in a pony or tucking hair behind my ears its very inconvenient and i sort of miss my flowy hair bottom line it did lighten my dark hair didnt affect my natural hair texture made my hair want to mold to everything and dried out amp damaged my ends however it is faster to blow dry and i find it lays flatter after i flat iron worth it not at all i miss my flowy hair i hope my hair is back to normal by the end of the month give this a shot if youre desperate but make sure the tools you use are compatible and do a strand test if your hair is dyed
6026,4.0,the product is beautiful to look at specially the display unit and sleek handful design the processor is very fast and by loading appsit has been found that the cell is working very fast and very responsive to any command the camera is not bad and by adjusting frame ratio good results can be obtained
6027,1.0,speaker not working properly
6028,4.0,i have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress why didnt you make it in petite it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side would have been ideal love the navy will try the white how about some more colors and petite please more t shirt dresses in general too please
6029,3.0,love the warm fuzzies of this sweater did not love the unflattering cut the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down plus it was a little short in the front i have to send it back
6030,4.0,very useful light weight and easy to carry it takes about hours for full charging simple and sleek design i wish it could be a dust proof device someday the body needs decent amount of care if you want to maintain its look from scratches
6031,3.0,performance is not as expected go for different model version with high ram
6032,1.0,so this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute it looked a million times cuter in the photos
6033,5.0,a perfect budget phone gets the work done could have been better with a mah battery
6034,5.0,i am very happy with this sandisk if anyone is looking for a goodly amount of storage get this one
6035,2.0,what drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front the shirt was folded at the store which makes sense because if it were hung it up fewer people would try it on this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back this is what bugs me about so many clothes that are made these days they are so cheaply made so thin with cloth that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public i cant wear sheer clothes
6036,4.0,i love this robe and cant wait to wear it while im getting ready for my upcoming wedding the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy but other than that its perfect
6037,2.0,very slow processing
6038,3.0,your enginer are charged rs ie instalation charges but other product are free so please ret the same
6039,1.0,only connected to wireless network once once stopped music wont connect to wireless network i returned it
6040,2.0,there doesnt seem to be much oil in this at all unlike the elvive one this is awful it makes my hair frizzy and the only thing good about it is that it smells good
6041,4.0,helps me stay on track with reminders throughout the day it reminds me to check the stove so dinner doesnt burn it reminds me to take the clothes out of the washer etc its very very useful in that respect
6042,1.0,i really hated this like others have said no conditioning actually dried hair out completely tangled mess i had to use a massive amount of spray dentangler afterwards im really disappointed and will be returning this dont be sucked in by the clever verbiage on the bottle and packaging
6043,4.0,camera works good in daylight battery works good sound is good screen was better camera not for dimlight photography performance is better
6044,1.0,video quality very bad background no clearance
6045,3.0,i fell in love instantlybutupon looking in the mirror it is percent see through at least the black is i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath however that maynt work the shirt is lovely in and of itself but at i dont need a see through shirt it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected so size down almost so good
6046,4.0,im so in love with this skirt i sized up to a im typically a in maeve and its pure perfection i had to steam it after getting home from the store because it wrinkled up pretty quickly wore it with my copper birks and a chambray top but i can see this being dressed up for work as well took off a star due to his easily it wrinkled
6047,2.0,with all of the glowing reviews of this dress i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress it fit nicely the quality was great but there is a decorative line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time kept glancing down to make sure i hadnt come undressed i suppose i couldve gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut but decided to take it back i didnt see tha
6048,4.0,i love having it i dont have a smart phone yet but still enjoy what im capable of doing now
6049,1.0,i bought this phone yesterday using one day my feedback for this mobile is worst finger senser is not work properly heating problem etc
6050,4.0,i ordered this dress in raspberry the color is beautiful in person i am usually a petite size and it fits perfectly the only thing about this dress that might drive me crazy is that it seems to wrinkle easily other than that i think its a great dress for summer
6051,3.0,my review of the pros quality made not see through in any way can wear with small bra straps lace gives the top a different look really liked it my review of the cons which made me return the top runs huge i am small c broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl it was large in the bust area and almost puckered at the armpits i would probably order sizes down to an xs which i never wear in any size top for petite gals i am this a a
6052,5.0,i have bee using this product for more than a year but d output is still d same
6053,5.0,phone is suprb working however earphones are damaged peice the right side is not working
6054,1.0,camera not as mush god as expected but battery life is superb finger print scanner is worse
6055,2.0,lost it day before yesterday as it slipped out from the front
6056,4.0,this is the first time i have tried the ogx brand and because of the coconut water i decided to give it a try i love the cute bottle and even more so that it is made from recycled resins i think the smell is great not too strong and it cleaned my fine hair very well and left it lightweight the texture seemed a little thick but when added to the water it was fine here is a video review httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmyebrtclgga
6057,4.0,ear bud need little improvement
6058,1.0,over heating problem found its very horrible
6059,3.0,windows not performing good
6060,1.0,adaptive brightness feature is not working perfectly there is a problem with light sensor when you hover a finger on the left side of the camera the screen brightness reduced to or so and never increase to the actual preset level attempted multiple times to slide to brightness but once put a finger and shade the left side of camera it goes down to for sure its a sensor related problem and not just limited to one or two handsets hence it seems to be a major issue
6061,5.0,echo dot is a big help with my appointments and i love it
6062,5.0,beautiful medium weight duster it looks just like on line photos my store did not have this duster so i ordered on line i usually wear a medium top but sometimes a large im lbs and i dont like my tops tight i ordered this duster in xl because i like room in my cardigans i could have gone with a large i have to roll up the cuffs of the sleeves but i like to do that anyway this sweater duster is soooo soft and warm so comfy very stretchy with no closures on the front
6063,4.0,lovely dress that i recommend just not for those with my body type im broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down from the front everything is awesomefrom behind it was less flattering made my flat bum look flatter also the stripe patterns do not match at the break other than that the quality is fantastic the fabric is a great transitional weight the fit is comfortable and the style is classic
6064,1.0,amazon selling lie mobile heated during call and charging the phonecamera quality is very badplease dont buy this mobile
6065,3.0,my droid razr runs a little slow is it because of this card i cant be sure what i am sure about is i put this card into my gopro hero black edition and the video i record comes out choppy so i bought the sandisk extreme pro gb version of this card and the gopro works fine now sandisk is normally very good so perhaps i somehow got a bad ultra card i never returned or exchanged it because the warranty had expired before i tried it in my gopro and knew for sure the card was slow the sandisk ultra should work in the gopro hero according to the gopro website so again perhaps i just got a subpar card
6066,4.0,very good product except battery
6067,3.0,this pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesnt bother me too much im not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress even with the slip which doesnt cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off i decided to keep and wear as an autumnwinter dress in which i will remove the slip wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
6068,3.0,i think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online but i really underestimated the vneck of this suit i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast as im basically an a cup i figured i would be fine the top portion basically has no coverage or hold even when tied very tight the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit needless to say my fianc was not a fan of the suit either even
6069,1.0,used this product for about months before it decided to stop responding tried resetting and moving it around the room and still no better thinking about switching to google home
6070,3.0,the pattern is cute its a little more subtle than in the photos the problems were the skirt are pretty sure it will wrinkle in two seconds and it has buttons down the front of it with no lining behind it which means if you sit down wearing this skirt and it doesnt lay quite right it gaps and you can see whatever is or is not underneath the buttons are like two inches apart so its not a tiny little gap no thanks also this skirt fir true to size it wasnt tight just gappy
6071,5.0,this memory card is so pocket friendly and fast data read write speed go for it you will not regret i am completely satisfied having purchased and used this memory card
6072,1.0,this sweater was huge it hung down to my calves it also is really bulky and scratchy it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people im and weigh lbs and i ordered a size s and i was swimming in it the fabric is very thick i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic it adds about lbs to your body frame
6073,5.0,the photos on the website do not do the dress justice i am into texture pattern and contrasting fabrics this dress is gorgeous in person not only has pattern but the pattern is woven so there is this wonderful texture as well that i had to try some of the reviews said the dress runs large others that this is a bodycon dress i ordered a size and my usual both were figure hugging but the size allowed this to be office wear while still being flattering i am fairly straight small
6074,1.0,sir pfa bed pruduct
6075,3.0,the material is soft and the pattern is pretty but it fits like a sack its too bad that this wasnt more formfitting with some stretch and a zipper because its fit is just not beautiful for tall very slender ladies this will be pretty as it is in the photo it fit me just fine with a little extra room on top but it went right back into the bag without a thought
6076,4.0,overall the quality of cable is good and give good charging but the braided cable is too tough to make it durable and not easy to carry around
6077,5.0,amazing product go for it
6078,2.0,i loved this product at first but now i absolutely hate it it costs me a for a bottle first of all it smells great just like coconut but doesnt last really long i have thin and dry hair this shampoo weights my hair down and makes it look greasy the consistency is thick but not moisturising enough for my hair overall i hate it
6079,1.0,its sheer the design print is casual but on silk like material had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer
6080,3.0,realme u front camera is not good and back camera very very bad
6081,5.0,i bought this top in a size im with a longer torso i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up the material is on the thicker side so its a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic
6082,3.0,everything about the phone is good only the main issue is the the battery backupit does meets my requirement as its not for the heavy users
6083,4.0,buy product and save money very cheaper great product
6084,4.0,i like this product price is resonable and is excelent
6085,4.0,this mobile is having best spec at its price since months i am using it the camera and the touch feature are good back gaurd is essential as it cannot be hold within the hands due to its glassy finish but the processor is not of snapdragon type
6086,1.0,sound quality noise cancellation and bluetooth connectivity is good enough in this budget but the mic went bad within months of purchase even one side earphone stopped working but the main problem is that their customer service is hardly ever reachable if you face an issue they pick up the earphones for service by a courier and never responded again its been weeks already since i sent them my bluetooth earphones but i am yet to get a reply leave alone getting my earphones as far as i know this is a similar case like another brand called house of marley boat brand is very bad in their customer service response this is a major drawback for an upcoming brand since if customer service team is careless then buying a boat brand product is as risky as buying any other non branded product
6087,5.0,like that productcanon d best deal
6088,4.0,love this sweater do wish i sized up for a little longer length but works great with high rise pants comfy and great color
6089,1.0,this device is very bad in this device have screen burn problem
6090,5.0,this is a great card that does what its supposed to do i will definitely buy again when the need arises
6091,1.0,stopped working after months of purchase
6092,2.0,dont even waste your money even on sale bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers unfortunately one of them ripped in the first wash i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through one of the other colors was fine yet still pilled pretty bad the third one still has the tag keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color but will only be using it as a knock
6093,5.0,initially was sceptical about buying this phone but with great exchange offer and added festive discounts from amazon i opted to buy this one and let me tell you im happy that i did what an amazing phone it has the best display in this segment with monster mah battery couldnt have imagined the vivid colors presentation and top notch battery its super responsive and feels premium takes brilliant photos even in low light above pic taken from this phone so at the end would definitely recommend to buy this phone
6094,5.0,couple of points sounds amazing very ambient but bose sound link revolve sounds a bit better it is beautifully designed looks sleek but missing out some smart features that comes in new bose speakers bose connect not for hiphop listeners more of a acoustic original soundtrack classic rock speaker watching movie is a really amazing experience considering the price and portability of the device not waterproof might be a bit splash resistant its either not mentioned or i havent read about it so dont let it come in contact with the water
6095,2.0,perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller but the knees on these were baggie by lunch they are very soft and comfortable but i wouldnt buy them again
6096,3.0,i bought this phone because of its battery life but display and performance of the phone is also very good with gb ram little disappointed with built quality cheap plastic used fit and finishs are fine upper body vibrates while using primary speaker at full volume because of plastic body display may broke if mobile falls from hand in normal conditions because of battery size and its weight i would suggest to buy hard case for better safety instead of flexible silicone cases at this price its good deal
6097,4.0,this is my first dslr i was in dilemma whether to go with this product or not after purchase i am completely satisfied though it is not professional dslr it is very handy captures best images i got all the items with product if you are going to start with dslr then this is highly recommended also if you have budget then go with additional lens which brings the cherry on top finally thanks amazon for timely delivery nice packaging
6098,1.0,this was a total disappointment takes longer to charge and they do not help charge the mobile even couple of times even the smaller non standard charges quickly and will help charge your mobile good fee times
6099,3.0,i think this is probably a fine product but it wasnt compatible with my samsung galaxy s phone formatted as exfat as it came from the factory didnt work at all but thats a known problem with the gs but even after reformatting to fat the card caused my phone to reboot multiple times
6100,2.0,speaker too low
6101,2.0,there is no warranty card in box
6102,5.0,i got this vest for my birthday and it is my favorite it has a very clean design well structured and you can really tell the product is high quality from the look and touch i would expect this to stay in my closet for years to come
6103,2.0,the suit is lovely but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg i was told that it runs small and to size up to a i did but i do not think the smaller one would have done better the bust is fake and it turns out when untied worst of all it emphasizes the tummy all in all not a good look for me i am not heavy but i do need tummy support normally i wear an and in garnet hill a sorry but it went back i really wanted to like it
6104,5.0,very nice phone supreme bulid quality overall best phone in this budget
6105,1.0,loses connections a lot has nothing top do with internet connection have been on several times with tech support for product and internet services echo dot does not support band internet
6106,4.0,runs a little large im lbs and ordered the medium probably could have gone with the small still it has a tie waste so it works love the length and print cant wait to wear it this fall with a jean jacket
6107,4.0,the material is soft it looks perfect with ankle jeans or flare jeans
6108,2.0,hanging a lot
6109,2.0,book is fair but delivery was worst
6110,5.0,amazingly soft jacket tried this on and three sales girls all said they wanted it the other reviewer said there wasnt any pockets but yes there are they are sewn so you have to undo the stitching but they are there perfect jacket at a great price first time i wore it i received several compliments
6111,1.0,plzz dnt buy dis phonebattery decreases automatically battery backup is bakwas n its camera quality is not good dis is d worst phone
6112,5.0,i have purchased many of retailers henley tees throughout the years this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store i love the look of the crisp white but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hot anyhow this shirt is made in my favorite springsummer tee shirt fabric s linen linen gets so soft and drapey over time the yoke is lace the arms have a small ruching that is sewn not buttoned up l
6113,2.0,this book is not updated it is better to go for an updated book on environment especially with the addition of new events like kews report chennai flood paris climate agreement etc the book covers a wide array of topics but it is mere a compilation rather than being a conceptual book which is the need of the upsc at places concepts are explained vaguely there are lots of unnecessary information as well like too much detail of endangered species reports verbatim reproduction of acts and policies related to environment etc which may harm a beginner who is unaware of what exactly is to read it is better to go for a comprehensive guide to environment and ecology by r rajagopalan published by lexisnexis this book has all the updated stuffs including uttarakhand disaster chennai floods etc it also provides a better and analytical understanding of the environment apart from these there is a chapterwise compilation of upsc previous years questions of environment both prelim and main which is really helpful better to go for rajagopalan sirs book rather than this book
6114,4.0,sound clarity is super and fit fine for small size rooms carry a battery backup of hrs which i feel sufficient for the pricing
6115,4.0,dress runs a little small in the arms but flows nicely on the body see through and comes with slip but slip is stiff and doesnt give was hard to get on so i wore my own slip other that that dress is feminine and looks great on
6116,1.0,the phone is very poor poor audio quality ear piece doesnt work major hearing problem despite getting it repaired the problem still persists the service team isnt ready to provide a solution waste of money
6117,5.0,increase your financial iq and its helps to put your money on investments not in savings
6118,4.0,laptop bill not received with product
6119,2.0,within one year battery performance getting worse day by day not at all expected from iphone
6120,1.0,received a defective phone stopped working on the second day not turning on
6121,1.0,very bad experience not getting charge called cce but in vain got reply from them to please visit phillips service centre
6122,5.0,this phone is a wow for its pricelook and basic use great gift to your friends and family
6123,2.0,please dont go for this if you are new to the habit of reading books im writing this after reading pages the writing style is completely clumsy at every lesson he says what he already said and what he is gonna say and uses the complicated words unnecessarily its complete waste of time it will reduce the interest of reading books if you are a beginner go for the power of subconscious mind by joseph murphy instead of this
6124,5.0,as soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath it does run large but thats my style i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties can be dressed up or down highly recommend
6125,2.0,i guess it made my hair soft but once applied to my hair any part of skin my hair came into contact with broke out horribly i have weird small pimples along my jaw my cheek where my hair brushed against a few times and other places my hair just lightly touched i had clear skin before this wouldnt buy again very disappointed
6126,3.0,nothing special worth if you want the brand name of apple only then go for it otherwise dont
6127,2.0,battery quality is too bad it doesnt stay for a day max hrs normal usage and there is no return policy only exchange
6128,1.0,speaker of this phone is cracked while i received this product
6129,5.0,very nice product and very useful quality is also very nice one of the best power bank in this price
6130,5.0,love it use it everyday
6131,5.0,listen to all the reviews size down i got the dress in my usual size large thinking it would fit well size i have large hips and a booty i was wrong i could camp out in the large it was super large got the medium and its fit amazingly its a tad bit tight in the chestbarely tight but im a dd and this is not an unusual thing for i just need to wear a thinner bra and it will be perfect cant wait to wear it loving the velvet trend this fall thinking about getting the blue too
6132,4.0,i bought this on sale the cools on the bird pattern are beautiful and i liked the detail on the sleeves a little see through but ok with a nude bra or tank underneath
6133,3.0,it was just too big in the regular size and too short in petite the proportion was off i bought a similar sweater last year in a blue color that i wore constantly and was hoping this would be like it i think if you are very tall you might pull this off im and even the extra small regular hung below my booty
6134,1.0,i took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs i am and i could take them off without unbuttoning them they were hugh even the xs they looked like a halloween costume even at the discounted sale price awful and kind of made me laugh but i guess thats why they are still available at this sale price
6135,2.0,small in size battery life is very poor as it goes only hour after full charge and it hangs sometimes during browsinglittle bit disappoint using this product
6136,5.0,mind blowing product no heating issue go for it and thanks for amazon
6137,1.0,the charging port became loose within few months of use and the cable given with the power bank is of poor quality would not recommend buying this model
6138,5.0,the echo dot is a great value i have a echo show in our main living area and have several echo dots in various other rooms to extend the system i use them mainly for smart home and music applications very easy setup and for such a small package its a great value for all that it does
6139,1.0,data usb cable is missing in the content so its a very disgusting thing for me if you can then deliver it soon
6140,3.0,this dress is so cute and so flattering i loved the shape but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better
6141,1.0,some basic features like screenshot call recording voice recording compass weather radio etc are missing for a phone which is so highly priced battery discharges pretty quickly wired earphones will need an additional appendage to connect with the phone although it comes with the package but if you loose it connecting an earphone will become a problem and lastly i am not able to use my old android chargers as this one has a different slot this is only good for people who love to take selfies
6142,1.0,this cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap
6143,1.0,worst camera ever in the segment even mi phones are better then this
6144,4.0,sound bass and noise supper
6145,2.0,automatically jack coming out
6146,5.0,this dress first caught my eye because of the beautiful color combination and when i tried it on i was sold its super soft and comfy and just the right amount of coverage
6147,3.0,a very basic phone and dont expect much in this budget the camera is quite ordinary and picture quality is not worth sharing with any onebattery is so far good
6148,4.0,i love mixed media clothing and this is no exception i fell in love with this right away and after being torn between the two colors opted for the rose its very gorgeous in person midweight and very soft however as soon as i put it on i noticed the knit sides truly flare out they dont lay nicely like on the model it could be because of my large chest dddd but everything below the chest seems to widen me it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest
6149,5.0,for this price this device is actually worth it samsung is the best for me personally and i dont think there is any better phone in this price range the camera quality and the battery life are also pretty good
6150,3.0,best mobile in range
6151,2.0,it has an i core processor but while working i found its working as dual core speed not good
6152,2.0,i felt compelled to write a review on this conditioner because of how horrible it is i have literally bought conditioner that is and it was much better than this i tried making this conditioner work i even used the whole bottle because i didnt want to waste it it did not make my hair silky nor smooth it did not detangle whatsoever it did not even feel like i had used conditioner and i left on my hair for the recommended time dont waste your money on this one guys i gave it two lippies because the smell is absolutely amazing this is the best smelling conditioner ive probably ever tried but other than that it serves no purpose in my honest opinion
6153,3.0,my hair loved this shampoowhen it was super short now that its grown past my shoulders this shampoo just doesnt work the same i kind of dont like the cone in it either i dont avoid silicones as far as conditionersstylers go but i dont like them in my shampoos its a little drying but not as drying as most shampoos ive tried plus the accompanying conditioner that i used to also enjoy when my hair was shorter took care of that i might revisit it and edit my review in the near future because this was one of the first products i went to after cutting off all my permed hair and i loved it
6154,1.0,the processor is not that speed as expected i have used iphone prior to this and i am feeling same
6155,4.0,this tv is worth to buy what we need is good picture quality with great sound and no slowness this tv has that all the only thing is its little messy with hotstar and inbuilt youtube version is older which can not be replaced with the latest one you have to install separate youtube application allover it is working fine
6156,3.0,i had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo i even waited for it to come back in stock the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy for reference i ordered xs and i am usually a on top small chested it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me so disappointing
6157,3.0,this is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit material is very thin i ordered white which was completely seethrough not at all what i was expecting might work better in a darker color but i returned it since it was nothing special
6158,2.0,the charging indicators placed at the side which makes hard to lookmetallic body weighs more
6159,5.0,feeling contented about the purchase
6160,1.0,says the one thing again and again
6161,1.0,it is in warranty period its screen display is not working at all i want a replacement
6162,2.0,not good not bad
6163,5.0,i wanted to upgrade my htc evo micro sd card i found this sandisk at a good price i have had few sandisks earlier and had no problems with it i ordered and it was shipped fast it comes with sd adapter and makes it usage as regular sd card i unmounted the existing card from the phone copied over the contents from one sd card to another using adapter and loaded up the new one works great i didnt see a huge difference in speed but may be i didnt run any speed tests or anything i like the price for the brand and gb card i will recommend it
6164,4.0,sound quality is perfect picture quality is good and never expect more features than this in any other product tonnes of features are preinstalled prime and netflix are pre installed tv installation happened the next day of delivery itself greatly satisfied with the product thanx to mi
6165,5.0,as im writing this review after using it for week as it seems that it is a good phone as per the specs and its performance features i liked the most battery life sound quality picture quality smoothness accurate sensors suitable for using with one hand cameras are excellent as per the daily use this was my review i think that it is not a camera phone like oppo or vivo but it is a phone which canshould be used for commercial use five stars are accurate for it thank you
6166,3.0,first off the dress quality is great the fabric is very nice the color is great i am lbs the dress looked like a parachute on me very unattractive because the fabric is pretty stiff i quite honestly looked pregnant
6167,1.0,i love tiny button down tops this one didnt work at all for me i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on
6168,4.0,overall the mobile is too good as it comes with stock android versions this is the most good feature i just upgraded from a the rear and selfie cameras are damn good in this price pictures are very sharp and clear battery backup is not upto mark as its coming with mah power display is awesome the touch is very sensitive and smooth but its annoying sometimes as unnecessary clicks happening even if you are not intentional
6169,5.0,this skirt is super cute and versatile dressed up but still pretty casual with a sweater tights and boots id say true to size or maybe runs a little on the large side definitely doesnt run small love it
6170,2.0,i am a dd and lbs and this top was way too baggy it looked awful this is shapeless and oversized i would size down or just pass
6171,1.0,voice quality is very bad
6172,5.0,its a beast for gaming entry level seriously no other laptop will give you this specification at this price point
6173,2.0,the first time i used this product my hair was full and bouncy i have ca hair but after a few more uses i noticed my hair getting drier and drier i think it is a proteins in the product my hair doesnt usually react well to proteins i thought maybe there wouldnt be too much in this product and bought it based on other high reviews on another site
6174,2.0,i have no rating for this item redmi y very low flash light as low as i can not find anything at night lighting up this phones flash very poor picture quality of rear camera after a few minutes of charging the set became warm sometimes the set hung up
6175,3.0,weak fingerprint reader
6176,2.0,this mobile is not having sd card slot processor is bit slow not good in comparison to honor view not getting resale value too no buyer want to purchase this model
6177,5.0,its so cool
6178,1.0,within an hour of using the memory card it failed and died it kept saying memory errori could never get my dashcam camera to record anything i went to our walmart and got me just microsd not ultra it has been working all day so farthats right there is no way to tell what you are getting online is oem or knock offs when the price is too good to be true it probably is made and distributed by mofia lolalthough the package arrived on time i will never buy this product online or from this seller on amazon waste of money
6179,2.0,i dont care for the consistency of og shampoos theyre too much like jello you need too much product to yield any type of lather the breaking point was when my husband told me i smelled like wet dog what every woman wants to hear after a shower
6180,1.0,sirs last night mobile was charged per cent but todays morning the mobile switchoff because of charging is automatic percent charging is due this mobile battery life is low
6181,3.0,i put a lot of hopes on this pullover i needed something for the spring and it seemed perfect plus the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices but i am not exactly disappointed but id say surprised i would still consider this sweater good for spring its thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like the pullover is very stretchy frankly i would prefer it to be less stretchy but that might be a plus for someone more busty the quality
6182,2.0,i bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case the fit is definitely sacklike as other reviewers mentioned i had to return
6183,2.0,i got a defective iphone xr the screen is defective theres a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen the phones working completely fine though so whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly it was my mistake that i thought that maybe its something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didnt and in that belief i skipped my days return policy as well i still dont blaim amazon because i have purchased my airpods from them as well but still appario should not sell defective products to customers now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least days its disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone the reason why i didnt upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone
6184,1.0,old content new book
6185,5.0,this tank was much needed for my wardrobe i love the vivid colors and forgiving cut i am lbs and purchased an xs
6186,4.0,except battery all is good camera shutter time is lengthy and the camera settings is very hectic
6187,5.0,the fit on this dress is super flattering i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one i am definitely a pear shape bigger on the bottom than the top one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top this is not often the case i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it i also love the colors i bought the green and blue i have worn it once
6188,4.0,love this top this is a very comfortable everyday top worn primarily with jeans please make it in more colors i think it should be less expensive
6189,1.0,bought this product on diwali offer initially for days it worked really well but on th day the speaker stopped working i havent did anything wrong with the speaker it just stopped working now i dont know what to do with the speaker as amazons return window is over really disappointed with the quality of product i think they are fooling innocent people very disappointed and will never order from amazon again

6202,4.0,i really like the appearance of this item and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings it does run a little large i am a true to size small and this hangs on me a little but i love the design of the back it is so soft and comfortable
6203,1.0,dont buy this fake one
6204,2.0,hias par your notification product warranty is year i purchased this productit was i used month then after this product not worked
6205,1.0,not good for this price as i hoped camera is average sound is also not too good backside is also very slippery jack of the charging is not working issues with internet services
6206,1.0,i bought this product for using it in gym but due sweat it stopped working in months i called up the customer care and they replaced the product which took almost days the replaced product also stopped working within months because of same issue
6207,2.0,i wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back i am going to return this item
6208,4.0,very useful for beginners
6209,1.0,i dont why this type of chip product amazon is selling only after days using my mobile lines appear at screen and not working left side screen disappointed
6210,4.0,great product works perfectly with my canon camcorder very responsive and fastenough capacity for hours video and great price grabbed in thanksgiving
6211,3.0,i dint like this phoneheating issues turned me off
6212,2.0,i wanted to love this sweater the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves however after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than minute one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo it must have added lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly yikes this ma
6213,3.0,not sure about this yet reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown belly peeked out from under it ordered and im normally a small like the design but really short
6214,4.0,i dont know why within month my fingerprint reader stopped working but only when it feels itself it works
6215,1.0,i loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit however when i got my pair the flower placement was completely different the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong but those were even worse they looked obscene
6216,2.0,it took days for me to get of these cards when i made the order early in the morningnormally thatll get my product to me the next evening not six days laterbe warned this was the slowest shipping ive had for my paid prime account since i started if you need these cards quickly buy from a different seller
6217,3.0,ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs i liked the length and overall fit of the xs however i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked overall its not a terrible vest but just not for me
6218,4.0,good among others
6219,5.0,my sister gave me this top for christmas and its perfect i find myself grabbing for it constantly im usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly i wear it with leggings and jeans
6220,3.0,this has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on at least for my body type i am with broad shoulders and slim and both the arms and dress length were too short in addition the size was boxy and unflattering sizing down to a would have exacerbated the length issues
6221,3.0,the fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful however the fit albeit unique is not extremely flattering in my opinion it may be because i am somewhat of a pearhourglass shape rather than a more straight shape but the fit is a little off imo i am and and ordered both the and felt the fit a little better
6222,3.0,the description doesnt indicate the metallic thread throughout the design you cannot tell from the pix either its also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater cant decide if i want to keep it or return it
6223,2.0,charger cable is not working unable to charge phone if you can replace charger
6224,2.0,has lot of issues screen goes on when you are on call goes to mute or hold when on call wifi turns on automatically
6225,3.0,i am giving this dress stars bc its pretty and i bought it but im going to need to get it altered big time i got the and its too big on top but this is the type of dress that should be fitted on top i am a small person but this fit more like a or print is beautiful though wayyy prettier than the pic i suggest getting sizes down i could see it being extremely gorgeous if it fits correctly
6226,3.0,its cool to have i mean it doesnt really do anything but argue with you and tally it cant do that
6227,3.0,bought on sale used times now to color treated waved hair doesnt feel like it conditions at allhaving to add conditioner after
6228,5.0,best quality phone in this price segmentonly thing is they could i have provide hdr display
6229,2.0,it works only when it is charging mode and when after hours we remove the charger it stop working as power is off automatically and even after several attempts it is unable to on it seems like a faulty headset
6230,1.0,dont go for this product i have seen the reviews and purchased it but to my surprise the ear phones are very bad at producing the decent bassinstead the bass is too heavy that even a bass head like me does not find it good too heavy to use it for longer times u might end up hurting ur ears
6231,1.0,if you change your wifi code you might as well throw this thing in the trash will not let you change code even tried reinstalling the ap got nowherewas a birthday gift or should i call it a birthday curse a little pricey for something disposble
6232,1.0,worst product please dont buy camera quality is blur often battery is not as expected phone has hardware issues cant get good network coverage
6233,5.0,amazingly amazing
6234,3.0,nice book but pages are rough
6235,1.0,i bought it on may camera is average when compared to its pixels mentioned battery life is poor i have to charge twice a day i dont know how it will be after months i may have to charge it times a day sometimes i feel like the keypad is slow and nonresponsive most of the times i felt like the process is slow in opening different apps i dont recommend it to anyone better to try mi or samsung which has above mah battery
6236,3.0,we have a regular echo also but they will not work independently or each other for some reason little hard to figure out
6237,2.0,on a positive note the dress was very well made great quality as usual from retailer however this dress looked like a sack i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape very plain and unflattering for reference i am lbs c so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me it had to go back
6238,1.0,had opted for an exchange offer of the old phone my parents who are both senior citizens were at home when the delivery boy came with the new phone his behaviour was extremly rude he insisted for the box and charger of the old phone to be given with the old phone and was not willing to handover the new phone to my parents my parents were extremly terrified and gave the box and charger of the old phone in fear this is really unacceptable
6239,3.0,i am returning i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua but the biggest problem for me is the shape its pretty boxy and its hard to tell from the photo but it has a batwing shape i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory less yellow in it but thats based on what looks better against my skin tone i found it to run true to size but i thought it was unflattering made me look wide
6240,1.0,i got travelsizes of this shampoo and conditioner ive been using the dry oils from organix the macadamia nut and the awapui with great results so i was curious about trying the shampoo and conditioner with argan oil the conditioner was very heavy a thick jellylike cream that is rather hard to spread evenly through your hair my hair felt dry and heavy immediately upon application afterwards when id washed it out my hair was shiny but very staticy and drylooking i am throwing this out not worth it
6241,2.0,the chevron pattern on the mintseaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address unfortunately the nd suit i received was also off center that one is going back too would have loved this otherwise a quality check on this is definitely needed beware
6242,3.0,so the dress is interesting has an asymmetrical wrap look short sexy length im and the petite barely covers my assets and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls it crosses over and stays closed but looks sexy and plunging but the shoulders are what make it look matronly theyre wide from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulderupper arm they show no shoulder at all which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexyish i looked back
6243,5.0,its good product nice sound original as well as they give you addiyional two pair of buds with diffrent sizes to suit your ear comfort
6244,3.0,just i took in march now its not at all working worst product
6246,4.0,this poncho is very pretty and uniqueit does run very oversized however thats how it is styled to be the embroidery is very nice it does sit back on the should a little further than pictured the open weave is a little looser than the picture seems and you will need to wear something under it cami tank body shaper probably will pick or snag pretty easily also the longer hem in the back is cute but if you are on the shorter side you may not like where it hits it will look best with
6247,2.0,i wanted to love this however the fit was funky and the colors were muted this is definitely something you must try on in the store too risky to buy online due to weird fit
6248,3.0,pros soft quality top true to size and would look great a little tucked in and off the shoulder reality it will be hard to keep the shoulders from sliding up and on me at least it looked really mehkind of dumpy im normally a medium and i bought the medium herefit was good its billowy and accurately displayed in the pictures so as an hourglass shaped gal id need to tuck in the front or all or accessorize to give it a little shape i really liked the feel a
6249,5.0,its fine
6250,1.0,this is worst mobile gps working not properly i am used just days mobile is strucked very bad custom oscolor os if u use only camera so this is best other wise waste of money
6251,5.0,best sound picture quality awsm structure
6252,4.0,good product in this price of range you can buy it
6253,1.0,the product durability is month i just lost my bill details so i cant claim my warrenty but this earphones built quality is bad it stops wrking completely after month sep to nov life span dont lose ur bill details incase u want that warranty and after purchasing u must register ur product in boats site for replacement and warranty
6254,4.0,it is good and value for money but the front camera is not so good
6255,2.0,i got sucked in by advertising again its kind of okay i guess i dont feel like its any better than any other shampoo ive used but its so much more expensive the formula is weird and goopy and i find it hard to get it to lather up wouldnt repurchase
6256,3.0,this top is adorable and has a looser fit as shown on the model shot so i would have liked to size down however the arms are extremely fittedtight and theres no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down if you have slim arms maybe you could size down and make this work
6257,1.0,for specs of this laptop in this price range i am giving stars but heating issue of acer nitro laptops takes out all stars from it and leaves star overheating can damage laptop and this laptop fan placement make sure tht your laptop gets heated jokes apart dont buy this laptop for heavy use this is no gaming laptop i returned this product
6258,1.0,worst earphone after months it is not working
6259,1.0,dont buy it phone hanging problem and phone not working in date mood
6260,1.0,worstheating problem
6261,2.0,i bought this i phone on nov nd now this time i have to find out the aaple care
6262,2.0,started well but lost the momentum at last less knowledge shared
6263,4.0,product is good weight is also normal for a mah battery camera quality is not as expected processor could be a bit improved ram management is absolutely fine when it comes to battery life for heavy user it comes for day and moderate user it comes around day and a half when data is completely on i didnt observe any much difference with the dolby atmos option provided when headset or earphones plugged in worth buying the product at this price range from samsung
6264,4.0,overall its excellent phone in budget sometimes camera app crashes while switching from back to front or vice versa
6265,4.0,stars because i wish i could afford an a the a is a great camera pity that that the optical steadyshot is only in the lenses those with less than a rocksteady photographers grip should seriously consider saving up for the with inthebody stabilisation bear in mind one can buy much cheaper lenses and still have the facility i cant add to the wealth of information on the a to be found on the net most reviewers are enthusiastic about almost everything except the toughtofindthings menu structure this lens kit is an easy entry point id recommend however considering more carefully what lens you would like to have on your camera almost all the time if it isnt one of these two then buy a bare body and save the money towards the lens of your choice in retrospect mine would have been the with constant f if you have a steady hand using oldmanual lenses is easy on this camera my olympus mm has come out of the cupboard after a long time manual focusing is easier than it was on the old film slr and focus peaking etc make it even easier a set of extension tubes is also a worthwhile addition to this kit it adds actual macro missing with these lenses at a fraction of the price of a macro lens
6266,1.0,heating problem
6267,5.0,i was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews well i must say im so glad i did i really love the shape of this dress im heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist the dress is very well made if you order the right size for you the slip dress will stay in place im going to style it with high black platform heels but i also like it with boots as
6268,3.0,lack of features during time of use
6269,5.0,this is the cutest poncho style sweater but the arms arent attached like a true poncho it doesnt work for a petite customer unfortunately but on average sized its gorgeous so pretty
6270,2.0,this tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole first of all the armhole is way too low second there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem no need for the side zipper it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side
6271,1.0,doesnt work well with my lights
6272,3.0,while charging mobile and charger both are getting heated too much unable to hold for few minutes which is i think not for good battery life and mobile will work flawless more than year
6273,1.0,i am writing this review after year use from last months pictures taken from rear camera are getting worst day by day the focus is somewhat distorted and pictures taken in low light are useless

6332,1.0,amazon team is not at all helpful if you want to exchange and made a payment online it is really a worst product and and once you made a payment online to amazon then no one will listen and help you on this kind of purchase so beware of making a payment for these kinds of product as amazon technical team will force you to keep the same without any help
6333,3.0,first this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look however there are several items to note primarily this sweater is very expensive the wool has an itchy feel the quotdrapequot is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom so it is annoying when you first put it on it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves
6334,4.0,i love the way organix products smell i would use the shampoo but its too moisturizing for my hair the conditioner is great though very thick and creamy too im not sure if its the best in its price range but i love the smell it does condition my hair nicely and i like the packaging i bought enough to last me for a year because i buy them when they are on sale

6344,5.0,i am always on the hunt for jeans and regularly buy paige these jeans are different than the regular paige styles in all the best ways they are made with super soft denim that is comfortable and very flattering the waist is high so my tush doesnt hang out when i sit i love them i am and lbs and these are long i can only wear them with heels but i was looking for a dress up jean and these are it

6348,3.0,gud phone for k picture quality is really appreciating and the face lock is very fast butt the processor is average some apps stops automatically sometimes camera also but battery is really good and charge very fast
6349,3.0,this shirt is really cute but a little stiff it does come with a slip but the slip was tight but the shirt fit maybe even a little big i used another cami under which was better i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs the actual shirt i got it in the store with the off so it was a good deal it does stretch out as you wear it so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger but still cute on and for a summer shirt its thin so it does work well in that r
6350,4.0,this wash is so beautiful but i found the rise too long for me so happy i found them in p here on the site they are wonderful but id like to caution with respect to proportions i have long legs for a petite ha and a petite upper body these jeans almost entirely differ with respect to length so id say if the your torso is fairly true to a regular fit and your legs are shorter you totally save on hemming the regular fit jeans like another reviewe noted hemming will reduce the fl
6351,5.0,really like this top fun flair nice quality shirt great for dressing up with skirt and also would be perfect with boots for the rodeo i paired it with a skirt and boots for church wore white cami under to emphasize lace details super cute tried and p thought petite was too short in length on me will send petite back

6353,2.0,i cannot figure out how to set alexa to connect with my smart tv in order to turn the tv on and off and control other functions
6354,5.0,this is a great device i have a full size alexa in my living room but have dots in both bedrooms the kitchen and even the bathroom the volume is pretty low for the bathroom if taking a shower or in the kitchen while doing the dishes it can get drowned out pretty quickly i know it is meant to be connected to your stereo or external speakers but i am just using the builtin speaker the volume is perfect in the bedrooms and it even makes a real handy alarm clock
6355,3.0,this top is super cute however the bottom hem is all frayedcouldnt really tell that from the pictures the flutter sleeves are too biglooks funny with the frayingruns a little large as well loved the color perfect with white denim
6356,5.0,i like this mobile highlight features display battery offers best quality display at below rs k price i heard about the superiority of samoled display over ips display very often while watching youtube reviews of samsung phones but i didnt realize that when i have a brief hands on a phone of my colleague i came to experience the real quality of led display after purchasing this mobile while watching movies on amazon prime especially while looking at blacks it shows us how dark should be the black wide color gamut it can produce gives us better viewing experience mah battery gave me hours backup in hour mid heavy range usage this is the best among the all phones i have used till now redmi note pro comes at second with hours backup build quality may not be as great as redmi note pro but it is good you might find better mobiles for gaming but for regular usage it is more than enough camera is good in daylight but low light photography is not satisfying over all it is worthy phone if you watch movies a lot and you hate to charge the phone regularly this phone is highly recommended
6357,1.0,its camera quality is very badi thought its samsung phn so its camera quality would be very but it was its opposite

6360,5.0,this sd card is very compatible with samsung galaxy si recomended it to all galaxy s owners regards
6361,4.0,this is a very nice dress the jersey is soft and high quality the construction appears solid the color is very pretty and looks in real life just like it does on my computer the cut and draping just dont work for me theres just too much draping too much fabric it overwhelmed me and made me look bigger than i am i have a feeling this would be much more flattering on a curvier figure than my own this dress seemed to be trying to accentuate curves i dont really have especially in the
6362,5.0,the product is very good im happybut shipping packaging is not secure that box has dent in the bottom side but nothing is damageits working execellent

6364,5.0,impressed with the k picture quality amazing tv and highly recommend to buy any size sony k hd tv
6365,5.0,im a big fan of left of center as a brand and this top is definitely a winner the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tentlike highly recommend
6366,3.0,nice
6367,5.0,i love this top i was thinking that i was going to need a xlarge because im very busty i tried it on at the store and the large was perfect its comfortable and flattering not boxy at all i bought it in plum and white the plum is more a wine color than a purple which i prefer the buttons are beautiful but i couldnt see myself buttoning and unbuttoning all of them since they dont slide out of the buttonholes easily but i had no trouble slipping it over my head with just a fe
6368,3.0,this sweater runs true to size i am and lbs and ordered the small it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle it is a well made heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm if you like the feel of wool buy it if not pass on it
6369,3.0,amazon delivered the product days late even after me being a prime customer so that cost the product on the star scale coming to the product it is a good choice for the price range it has a decent cameras the processor is fast and responsive fast face recognition good image stability and low light photography is decent with a few glitches there is a minor heating issue at times the only negative is the battery life i have used a phone with mah before it stayed way longer than m without the need for charging it to be precise with this huge a battery size that samsung claims the performance is not as great as it should be you will need to charge the battery twice a day with moderate use and no gaming if you are to use it for pubg youll need to charge it more than twice a day the picture and sound quality are decent as well but dolby atmos for sound works only with headphones or a bluetooth speaker i also experienced a slower internet speed with this phone and network issues all these cost the product a star i have written this review after using the phone for over a week
6370,3.0,its ok
6371,2.0,very slow hanging
6372,5.0,picture quality is awsmm as expectedsound is to high i think it can batter if the sound of speakers is lowbattery life is good but not for gaming c port charger is good for changing takes less time to chargelast thing everything is okkkbut i want to change the navigation button to slide back from left sideif any one knows then tell me
6373,4.0,i like very much very cheap when compare to local market
6374,3.0,overall a really nice top that is soft and comfortable the arm length hits nicely on the forearm and the decorative detail at top is wellconstructed didnt keep this since the top made me look quite big in my bust to the point of not being flattering top is also a bit boxy so id stay away if you are petite with a larger bust unless you are okay with that emphasis
6375,2.0,cant answer most questions by the time you figure out how to word your question correctly you can boot up a year old desktop and search for the answer with more reliable results answers and reacts to echo commercials which is wretchedly annoying can play some music but tries to upsell you on the amazon music bundle so ultimately its quicker and more reliable to pull your phone out and look it up on youtube all in all its novel but not worth the price point for something that poorly does tasks your phone already does fine
6376,1.0,it seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment however i found the band to be extremely small and tight it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin
6377,5.0,amazing phone iphone s in its worthy enough to give a tough competition to todays phones like mi note in performance
6378,5.0,i tried this recently and really liked it i like to use oils to detangle dry hair and this gives me the slip i need the consistency is light and the smell is nice
6379,4.0,loved everything about this sweater but the short length didnt notice in the pictures but the last one of the back of the model shows the length it barely reached the very top of my jeans so would have to wear something under or id be flashing my stomach all the time worked a bit better with skirts but still too cropped for my frame wish it was longer in length and would have been a new fall favorite really great color and design besides that just make sure you are wanting the sh
6380,4.0,after using for months i feel the picture quality is not up to mark being dual camera didnt meet minimal expectations selfie is average and over whitens the pictures battery life is great performance is also good
6381,1.0,very very bad and poor quality mobileits worst mobileand always this mobile hangsvery bad software it hasthis is a money waste product please dont buy this mobileeven it comes at very cheap rate alsodont look about this productif u buy this mobile u will throw this mobile in scrap after one month for sure
6382,1.0,this looks nothing like it does on the website it runs small and the colors are so muddy it doesnt drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short stiff and plain ugly sent it back immediately
6383,4.0,i am not one to complain about things being cut too big as i generally dont mind lose and flowing however this dress is very bell shaped and the fabric is just thick enough that it doesnt really lay well at least not like it does in the photo i bought the earthtone color way and i felt like i was wearing a macrame version of the liberty bell it is also a lot shorter than i was expecting if it werent so short i would try sizing down it is very good quality and the slip is super soft
6384,4.0,wanted to get this sweater in the red but the size has been sold out for a long time then saw the navy go on sale and snatched it up great fit cropped shorter than most sweaters very classic looking and perfect for layering into the fall
6385,5.0,saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint i ordered a xxs in black and it was perfect i am and lbs it definitely has a lot of volume to it but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer so you can see through it to your thinner figure underneath it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it which makes it flattering another reviewer mentioned the beading turning i have not seen that on mine but now i will be looking for i
6386,5.0,wowwww amazing product value for money super amoled in this price wow
6387,5.0,caught my eye at checkout and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick tryon which ended up being a great call the dress is super easy and flattering as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape the fabric has a sweet floral texture and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting im and it came just above the knee in front while the back was a bit longer another flattering feature this is going to be a summer goto
6388,1.0,after month period crackling noise started coming from the speaker while playing any audio
6389,2.0,works fine when its online but every time the network hiccups i have to go through the setup procedure to get alexa back online happens at least once every day it needs to automatically reconnect like an iphone to wireless networks
6390,5.0,this is a fantastic phone i have been using it for almost two weeks now and this phone is really beautiful value for money for the normal working person you are unlikely to get a better option than this the battery is unreal finger print reader works perfect and camera is of a quality of a high end premium phone in fact this is truly a very high end premium phone at budget middle class prices please dont believe all the negative reviews ive bought two of these phones both gbgb by gods grace sairama theyre both working beautifully perfectly even with the heaviest use i charge the battery only after hours and thats with really heavy use you know what they say that theres no perfect phone theyre wrong this is your perfect phone
6391,5.0,nice camera quality osum design colour

6395,4.0,money west
6396,1.0,pathetic as expected online not trustworthy
6397,2.0,the overall styling was great and the dress is supercute if a little thick its made of denim after all i ordered a size down from my normal and even then i was swimming in it the worst part and the aspect that will make me return it is that the arm holes hang down so low that id have to wear a tank top under the dress im returning it though it is really cute and i love this brand the arm holes killed it for me
6398,3.0,very limited functionality just a tracker dont expect much from this band
6399,2.0,no bass flat sound battery life not good painful after to min plugin not satisfied with boat bt
6400,4.0,i ordered this top in the purple color and was pleasantly surprised that it was more of a soft periwinkle the weave is quite open and sheer which is what i had hoped for the fit is great and the bottom flows quite flatteringly overall the sweater is soft and very feminine but careful it snags easily
6401,3.0,i dont get too worked up about memory cards usually try to buy at least class i am sure this is a fine card just the one i purchased was defective replaced it with another brand not wanting to try twice
6402,2.0,charging speed was toooooo slow it was actually discharging while i put my smartphone in charging while using it
6403,2.0,i bought gb gb variant for k rear camera quality is bad and front camera is not upto the expectations look is mediocre dont buy black variant plastic body you dont get rich feel at all as compared to redmi note pro i am very disappointed by camera and looks
6404,1.0,i bought this tv as it is an android tv it should have amazon prime netflix but both applications are restricted in playstore by mi so i told them to place a return request but they are not accepting it saying you should have to confirm it before placing an order so now on if i will have to buy any android mobile i will have to call them and confirm all the thousands of applications which is available in playstore asking whether this applications are supported in mobile or not screen quality is too poor i am prime member of amazon but i am saying now never buy anything from amazon cancelling my subscription of amazon prime as well
6405,2.0,i was very disappointed in this shampoo it left my hair feeling stripped and fragile even though it is sulfatefree the smell is yummy though i returned it to the store
6406,1.0,i received this from amozon and it is the worst thing i ever bought
6407,4.0,here are some pros and cons for the mobile pros excellent battery life excellent screen quality good camera quality good ram management very fast charging the brand value of samsung and its services premium looking durable latest android and software after the latest update cons inaccurate face recognisation processor not the best in this price the back of the phone gets easily scratched screen can get easily scratched screen guard higly recommanded
6408,4.0,this top is very pretty its a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on but otherwise as expected you can adjust the ties at the shoulder
6409,1.0,what the i received tv days ago no one contact me for installation worest experience ever
6410,4.0,there are options for you in this price segment one plus t iphone i really dont like android bcuz of irritating ads in every app and lag i was using nokia plus so i decided not to go with the android this time at the end of the day its upto you if youlike android then you must go with one plus t or the iphone got it next day thanks amazon

6413,2.0,i love the look and feel of the material but it was way too short i dont even have a long torso sadly its going back to the store
6414,2.0,camera quality is not good as compare my using oppo mob mi a have triple camera but camera quality is so dark its work like old phone n its not more brightness in screen
6415,1.0,the material is so thin and so itchylike other reviewers statedit itches so bad and feels like sandpaperi thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
6416,3.0,ok mixed emotions on this great for a conver piece but serious worries and s on her maybe i havent learned enough but alexa comes on so many times by itself wanting to order wout permission paid for music but does not know or plays something random with some name similar i do have to tell it to shut off and lol shut up it never understands my questions the classici do not know that please contact is old verbage you cant make her understand anything if anything she shuts you off by turning off quickly very confusing a very confusing ai item it also comes alive and never says anything and turns off my hub and i have witnessed this together we use it only ocasionly for music purposestoo freaky for relying on
6417,3.0,after im using one month honor n is best phonecamera is superbut battery life is low one day normal usingthanks to amazon im your regular customerthank you

6425,4.0,the echo alexa can do quite a few interesting things its amusing how much content is addedthe speakers are not that great i intended to use this in the bathroom as a shower music player its not loud enough to enjoy over running water i suggest you use an external speaker something bluetooth after initial setup of your external speaker it will always auto connect afterwards when you turn on the said speakerthe microphone is surprisingly good at catching your voice even over music playing sometimes though ill be in another room talking and ironically my echo will cause this device to respond not that i ever said alexa or in my settings echo just a little annoying cause shell then respond sorry im not sure about that or some other responsealso another thing i noticed was not everything inside apps will work for example i use spotify as a music player if i told echo to put the song in repeat shell say its not supported maybe not echoalexas fault but the developerstheres a lot that other ai can do ok google for example watch youtube demonstrations for comparison one of the examples is you cannot do is followup questionsother than a few technical details and unimpressive speaker it works well i wish this was battery operated instead of outlet to take on trips or something

6427,4.0,this dress is lovely in person light rose color and quality fabric im a c and had to go down from my usual to a to get a proper fit in the bust and bodice the full skirt leaves plenty of room to size down if necessary this would work best on someone with a larger bust and small waist but because of the cut i recommend trying on before buying if you are smaller busted the front tie can be adjusted slightly to get a better fit the skirt portion is unlined though the fabric is thi

6433,2.0,i know weve gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable but sometimes its still that horrible texture unbreathable mess unfortunately thats what this top is made out of so it runs big its billowy and cute but i couldnt get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric
6434,5.0,i wrote this review just to inform you guys who complained it being slow laggy freezing hanging etc simply add gb ram to it windows needs more than gb to run smoothly all those who say gb is enough for windows are talking crap and knows nothing it has an extra ram slot i have added gb ram so now my machine has gb ram its now blazing fast as if my sick donkey has been converted into an arabian stallion

6441,5.0,value for money great camera and easy
6442,1.0,i ordered this top in size xl there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much this accentuated my pearshape and was unflattering the sizing on the top portion sleeves was truetosize the material is so rough scratchy uncomfortable they should have used a softer fabric the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received at i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous matching line i didnt notice the mismatched sleeves of the

6446,3.0,i was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking im c and i wear size pants usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romperjumpsuits but not this one i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big i probably could have gone down a size but i wasnt loving it enough to try the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp

6448,3.0,dont waste your hard earned money first day itself it got scratches then i realise there is no protection used in display amazon people dont even consider for return as flipkart do realme phones are far better and cheaper its camera performance is equivalent to some phone in market
6449,2.0,love the tegan tunic version of this dress i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong this runs so big i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on i highly recommend ordering at least sizes down unless you want to look tenty

6451,3.0,i couldnt believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way what i didnt like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it
6452,5.0,me waist hips bought the size im expecting a bit of stretch to allow a bit more room for the booty spandex and they seem like standard cartonnier charlie fit i love the kicky cropped flare theyre described as grey motif but everyone in store and i agree called them green the main diamonds are forest green with a greygreen inset and a bluegrey inset inside that whew they come with an extra button keep it as those tiny buttons are going to be first

6454,3.0,the sound quality takes a big hit i play have a lot that requires me to listen to audio ques and i enjoy listening to music both of them were affected by the use of these also the ear plugs were slightly large and the rubber stiff enough to hurt my ears after continuous use
6455,4.0,this dress is by no means a statement piece but if youre in need of a good basic to get you through winter this is a great option im normally a m or l busty and hippy hourglass shape and found it to fit tts in a l if you fall inbetween two sizes but dont have larger hips or a larger bust like i do you could probably size down to the smaller of your two sizes it goes great with black tights tall black boots and a scarf i didnt realize at the time i ordered it that the material is

6480,3.0,this a honest review after a week the battery life is great i like it it is a genuine day phone if you are not a heavy user the performance is nice but not the best because it does the usual tasks pretty smoothly but while game there is lot of lag the camera is also nice i really liked the ultra wide in this price point but the details are not the best overall if you are a regular user then it is great but it is not fir heavy gaming
6481,2.0,i ordered the top from a store to have it shipped it is very pretty but once on it fit the wrong way i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high
6482,2.0,i have purchased m samsung online on amazon on may after automatic upgrade of software it just died on june within days of purchase when approaching samsung customer service at andheri west on th june they have advised that the mobile phone can be replaced with new only within days and now mother board will be replaced why samsung can not replace with new phone as i was touring abroad all my picture and videos are lost due to this faulty piece or update it has created tremendous amount of anxiety to me and family atleast they should compensate for the loss of data and inconvenience caused to me when i was abroad hope this will reach to the responsible office ie amazon and samsung daxay jakhia

6488,5.0,yes these are a true clear red not neon red or orange red but a classic shade of red these pants are so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch they are a nice weight for springsummer without being too light or flimsy they remind me of j crew martie but i like these better id say they fit tts if not slightly on the large side for reference my waist is and hips are the size fits very well but the p were too big i also take a in the martie but those are slightly m

6490,4.0,good phone in less price
6491,3.0,chargers really slow battery doesnt stay long enough its design is not that good it took days to ship item to bangalore better buy from local market
6492,4.0,nice quality but enough material for two sets of tights can scrunch up at the bottom for a different look
6493,4.0,i bought this initially for the smell however as a mousse i think it works fine i have superfine long colortreated hair and almost always let it airdry after i get out of the shower i usually spray on some rusk brilliance leavein color protector and then put some of the organix mousse in when my hair dries it definitely has more body than usual nothing crazy more like what i wish my hair would be like naturally and it smells so good the smell sticks around too if i was really picky id probably put something on my ends to soften them slightly but overall im happy
6494,1.0,in just day speaker stop working no replacement
6495,1.0,the product packaging seemed like it had been opened it started up after charging but the screen went blank after that and any of the features didnt work at all the seller also was unable to replace the product this is the worst product experience i have had from any online site
6496,3.0,i wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring they are super cute but dont care for the way they sit on the hips
6497,5.0,overall phone was so good but battery draining so fast thats why i gave star only
6498,2.0,this is a very lovely looking sweater unfortunately it runs incredibly small im only and the size small hit me above my midrise jeans it doesnt fit at all how its shown on the model its also a very delicate fabric seems like it would snag easily i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it but im sending it back
6499,2.0,over heat very bad experience please change
6500,4.0,works on my samsung galaxy note but i dont really stress these kinds of things i have had no problems have not checked it for heat or any such thing
6501,1.0,i was so excited for this product being a graphic designer reading all the specifications on amazon and the hp official site i was believed that this is the best laptop i can get in my range as soon as i got the product i knew i made the wrong choice the specifications are okay but the screen is horrible the colors are so faded that any editing you do it will give results far different i dont even know how hp thought that this pathetic display will be enough for gamers i regret buying this and honestly it was a waste of my money i even put in an ssd for the speed but the display is so bad that it is unbearable to view anything everything looks dull i am really disappointment in hp i request everyone to not buy this product there are many other gaming laptops in this price range that has much better display quality
6502,1.0,i bought this to store all my music on my phone but it doesnt work the phone has trouble reading from the card and i keep having to reformat it buy one from sony or some other company instead especially if you have a gs

6507,3.0,nice soft jeans cute style and i wish i could keep themthey just are too small on me not sure if ive gained weight which i dont think i have because i had on a size pair of pants today but i ordered a size in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist i would honestly need a or looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt ill be able to get the size i need if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they dont fit my body type
6508,2.0,battery life is very pathetic have to recharge twice in a day fingerprint is very good camera is upto mark
6509,4.0,good one varity n plenty of questions but still not latest asked questions
6510,2.0,i have just disappointed by the battery life and i have faced heating issue after a moderate use not value for money phone anymore camera is good only but no natural color production spending k for a phone without having a headphone or pop up camera with disgusting battery life is not acceptable only gimmick hz display and oxygen os will not take this brand to touch the same level as iphone really disappointed

6516,4.0,good products in small family
6517,1.0,i love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it i was shocked when i opened the package first the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono which brings me to the second disappointment it is not a kimono at all it has no kimono sleeve no sleeves at all in fact just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu
6518,3.0,camera not good as like it says look like mp cameras battery life is good phone is slow not look it have gb ram overall not satisfied
6519,4.0,amazing picture quality works well in lowlight situations but the battery is a huge disappoinment but its cool deal for this budgeti bought this phone for k gb
6520,5.0,this is an amazing books everyone should read this
6521,2.0,tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece but the quality is below average for an retailer dress its just a shapeless thin beach coverup that i couldve picked up anywhere the yellow color is so cute though if youre looking for a light breezy gotothebeach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel this might be good for you but its too thin for just about anything else
6522,4.0,i agree with other reviewers that the material is pretty thin and it would make a far better swimsuit coverup or pajamas than an actual dress unless you dont mind that it is semi seethru however that said i do love it it is soft the cut on top is nice and the strappy back is pretty and it is flattering as long as your tummy is fairly flat because it does hug your body as you move so no bread and pasta i have worn it a couple of times already and i have received compliments on
6523,2.0,i am not able to connect my wifi with the phone went through all the threads and everything but nothing helps what a waste
6524,1.0,i am really disappointed with the whole organix line i had such high hopes for all of the shampoos conditioners and treatments it has been a huge let down since using the line my hair actually feels less moisturized greasy stringy and heavy i have not yet seen my hair have a unique shine or feel silky smooth very disappointed
6525,5.0,this is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted i had to size size down really nice
6526,2.0,i really wanted to love this waistcoat i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it it runs large but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed the hip area i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size its going back but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative
6527,4.0,overall good product but after some months after using bass problem
6528,2.0,osm
6529,5.0,i have worn this sweater many times i have received great compliments
6530,3.0,i used this product last month my hair looked very nice for the first two days it was very nice sleek and straight but after i washed my hair again it was back to the frizzy poofy mess i tried again and i got the exact same thing it really shouldnt be called quotday straightquot if it only lasts for two it only cost but that it a waste since the product didnt do what it was advertised as
6531,1.0,i keep trying so that i can use up the bottle but its just not good the worst of the organix conditioners imo i have thinstranded but dense colortreated hair this leaves it dried out and impossible to even run my fingers through when wet feels like it just sits on hair and never penetrates it also doesnt help frizz as claimed
6532,3.0,works well with some apps like firestick a little limited
6533,1.0,waste mobile phone gets heated up within mins of call and it hurts badly to ears one may get pain in ears due to such heat battery drains very fast within mins it came from to front camera is good but back camera is worst not of mp
6534,2.0,i am very disappointed with the product design looks like old nokia ear phone right side is dull compared to the left one didnt expect this from jbl
6535,4.0,got this phone around a month ago my earlier phone was moto gs plus i am a moderate user of phone who keeps on hanging with internet and all the required essential apps i also play games at times now what good about m for me is premium software quality with no ads excellent display better performance compared to my moto phone this was where i surprised even though on papers this phone has not very powerful processors but still it gives its best when comes to background app management i have not felt any heating issues or lag issues even after using heavy apps for hours good front camera excellent battery life comes around days for me some cons even though primary camera is good but does not give its best in low light yes its software is premium with ad free but i was expecting samsung ui which is available in a series speaker could have been amplified more overall a very practical phone which gives u a premium feel especially due to its display many people compare this with redmi note pro i agree note pro is a good phone which has better processor but you cannot feel the same premium experience as m here is why just compare the both display check out note apps filled with full ads even though they claim mp its not always it it gives u in pro mode with no zoom option microphone and headset audio of m is better note is a perfect phone for teen agers who is more intrested in gaming or heavy usage m is for professional and moderate users who are more intrested in quality for primary usage of phone
6536,1.0,product was damage
6537,5.0,awesome sound quality and one of the best earphones for the people who go for running and gym its been ore than a week i am using this product so far happy and satisfied by the quality delivered
6538,4.0,these jeans are very unique thanks to the embroiding would have perferred colorful embroiding though they are boyfriend cut but not slouchy just a bit loose even around athletic legs they run true to size but have a lot of give after wearing them for a a little bit i catch myself pulling them up a bit if you want a snug fit and are between sized i would go down a size
6539,4.0,this shirt is versatile for work and fun my sister has this shirt and thought it was so cute i ordered it too
6540,5.0,love echo dot i ask her all kinds of things quick delivery thanks
6541,4.0,i dont think this is the conditioner that will become my usual conditioner but it is my favorite from the organix line so far i like how the conditioner works its rich and leaves my hair shiny yet not weighed down my issues with it are the smell and the packaging the scent smells good on first whiff but it is a heavy scent that lingers by the end of the night it was making me slightly sick the bottle is another issue its very cute but because this conditioner is so thick the thick plastic bottle makes it very difficult once the bottle is half empty to get any out i really need both hands to squeeze it and that doesnt work when i have to squeeze the product into one hand overall a good product though
6542,5.0,this review is based after using the mobile for days good battery on normal usage battery lasted for days smooth access no excess or unwanted apps though i had few it was easy to uninstall finger print reader is working well both front and rear camera pic quality is good i need to explore more
6543,1.0,returned it as it didnt do want we wanted out of unless you paid for a service

6545,2.0,poor back camera quality cant zoom mp back camera front camera is okk battery is okk finger print scanner is slow
6546,3.0,price point could be better worth speakers are what is really lacking sir far a great add on for control of my smart home though
6547,1.0,packaging smell amp the concept of organic makes this product sooo appealing after trying it this thing sucks my hair hated it it didnt do anything for it i might as well have used body wash on my hair amp it would have the same results
6548,1.0,this review is for the sandisk ultra gb microsdhc class uhs memory card with adapter sdsdqugaffpa that was purchased for me from amazonfrustrating in a word this card was reported by two different android phones as damaged but my windows computer recognized it with no issues if the card had nothing on it or had just been reformatted then the phones recognized it but as soon as data music or pictures were added then the phones reported the card as damaged i had this card returned to amazon after days of sheer frustrationi read another review that suggested the class cards were not ideal for smart phones i was already using a sandisk class gb card in another phone and had never had issues so i purchased a class sandisk gb and it was as smooth as butter both phones recognized the card right away and added data music and pictures seamlessly and quickly the second card purchased was the sandisk microsdhc gb flash memory card black sdsdqmgb retail packagingin summary this card may work just fine for other devices but based on the sheer number of other reviewers here on amazon and elsewhere on the internet that had similar issues with smartphones i cannot recommend this card for a smartphone

6612,2.0,i wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered but just decided to return it runs big and from the front it looks good but the back just looked like a big oversized stretched out tank it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing so if youre tall go for it

6618,5.0,as per expected got screen card sticked and back cover which is not expected
6619,3.0,okay so you may be wondering why i gave this such low reviews and then say i want to buy it again the reason is simple it doesnt do what it claims to do but i love the product so my hair naturally really wavyculy and kind of dry on the ends so i used the serum and shampoo and conditioner in hopes that it would help straighten out my crazy locks it doesnt do that cat out of the bag oh well ill live the shampoo is a really strange consistency almost mucusy weird it super thick and if i put it in my hand before applying it to my hair half of it slops out before it even gets into my hair it doesnt spread well either if i apply it to my scalp it wont reach the ends of my hair it smelled really good though i mixed it with some water and now after i do my regular shampoo ill apply a little along my hair line for that wonderful coconut aroma the conditioner is a little too light for my taste my hair needs a very thick conditioner to satisfy my thirsty hair so not using those two products ever again plus they were pretty expensive but then i tried the serum omg so if im planning on straightening my hair at least once a week i always blow dry it before hand it looks more more healthy and vibrant versus straightening after it has dried curly the only problem with this method of blow dry before straighten is that if im planning to go out right after my hair is kind of frizzy solution do this before i go to bed and ill wake up less frizzy but when i use this serum i dont need to wait a few hours for my hair to settle it looks shiny and smooth from the get go it also smells super good and feels warm and smooth in my hands only complaint in the packaging while it looks beautiful with the bronzegold colors and is ecofriendly a nice little plus its not a pump applicator for the serum and it drips down the sides of the bottle ugh so then i have to apply it in my hair and then wash the bottle off every time i use it so annoying after using it almost everyday thats another point i use this everyday on the tips of my hair to prevent them from looking too dry i love this serum and would definitely buy again just not as a quotstraightening productquot
6620,2.0,i was really looking forward to these tees working after reading the reviews unfortunately they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans trying to keep it age appropriate
6621,3.0,just got this in love the color and fabric but it has no shape on me i thought id wear a large because i have a ddd chest but i should have gotten a medium at the largest also even if it did fit it came with a stain resembling toothpaste right in front ill be returning
6622,1.0,this was so boxy and unflattering i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit sizing down would not help this one went back

6626,3.0,i had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim and these crops were made specifically for petites also i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean not a skinny the fit and sizing seems to be a little off i ordered my regular size in this brand p but they were too big sized down to a p they were still too large in the waist seemed very stretchy but fit well in the legs i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect

6630,4.0,i am inspired to sit in front of a roaring fire sipping tea with the dogs at my feet in this sweater or roaming the moors the cashmere is thick luxurious and soft there is a cable detail that runs along the large wooden buttons and also the pockets decent sized pockets to stash a hanky while roaming the moors the fit is on the large size and boxy if i had to nit pick i would say that the length could be a tad longer the sweater does not have complete derrire coverage i am
6631,5.0,the fridge was little dented and some strach on it i want some refund on the product

6637,3.0,the blouse is lovely i loved the lace color though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color and edging i am very petite for reference waist and e and normally wear a or p the was still too wide for me around the waistbottom and had too much of a swingy effect it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned i wish this had more of a fitted look to it
6638,3.0,while i wanted to love this dress i did not like the scratchy lining i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress so it clung to my curves uncomfortably i wish this had been done in silk would have been a much nicer material i returned it

6641,4.0,love this top very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure as so many retailer tops are these days one caution i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust normally a size or small in retailer tops but a dd so went up to a size the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed the fabric is sheer but not overly so embroidery is well done over all a b

6658,2.0,the length of this dress is bizarre i cant decide if its supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all im not sure if i like it either way also at this price point i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent if you buy this dress be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate the one i pur

6706,1.0,picked this up on sale doesnt work only shows up as a mb yes megabyte card that i cand do anything with i already threw away the original packaging too im sure returning it is going to be a huge pita because of thatupdate after writing this albeit short review i found this is not uncommon i also found that this card was deliberately crippled despite the product description saying the sandisk ultra microsdxc uhsi card works with any microsdxc compatible device that was all the motivation i needed to process a return on it rather than having it replaced
6707,2.0,i was not impressed with product it did no justice for my hair and i was not a huge fan of the scent
6708,1.0,if you are buying for taking calls pls dont all the ambient noise comes through the mic what boat calls as noise cancelling could be noise getting into your ear but the mic is pathetic i have jabra evolve which are wired and i wanted to go wireless rockerz are not even of them
6709,3.0,love the color cut and weight its like a fleeceweight coat but longer and more appropriate for an office within two wears one of the buttons popped off within three wears one of the back shoulder seams had split this coat is lovely but shoddily made worth it with a discount and if you know how to handsew because minor repairs will be in your future it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality
6710,4.0,another great dress by retailer ive worn it with tall boots with heels riding boots and bootiesall look really good ive also added a creambeige cardigan and even a fuzzyfurry vest very versatile the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it its a staple and keeper

6718,2.0,i have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat the sleeves are very wide although long as a light weight fall coat the sleeves dont need to be as wide because you wouldnt be layerng too much underneath the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh

6731,4.0,adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me i am super petite pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long both could fit around my waist which is a but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips if the length had been above the knee i might have kept the zero but they were both returned great skirt in the theory with the wrong waste fit and length
6732,1.0,this laptop is really pathetic first of all it takes a really long time to start and it gets hanged a lot it also is extremely slow i have been using this laptop for the past one year and has performed really poorly the mouse cursor has just disappeared and also cortana stopped working its not worth buying this laptop
6733,1.0,if you are a camera lover dont buy this phone samsung has shamed itself note pro same price range snaps pleasant pictures makers have devalued thier brand pathetic camera both rare and front stuck with this for years post which i will change brand

6743,1.0,i had high hopes for this top based on the photos but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it almost like a tie dye or slub effect not pretty at all
6744,2.0,the dress is extremely high quality i purchased the dress in black the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress the dress overall is like a balloon unless youre extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger i ordered the small petite and am lbs and i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately its going back the petite hits inches above the knee for reference
6745,5.0,awesome lowest price
6746,2.0,i love maeve but this shirts quality was poor and it was not worth the price i would not recommend buying this online you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not and in my case this is being sent back
6747,5.0,this pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans soft sexy without being skintight and the perfect color of blue i am lbs and the was a perfect fit these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing think legs that look a mile long with booties one night and nude heels the next
6748,3.0,this top is so pretty in the photos but it just did not work out for me it is more of a pale pink color than offwhite like in the photo and it just hung on me weird i felt like it was true to size but made me feel very boxy i can say it was very well made so maybe im just not the right body type for it for reference im and lbs the small fit perfectly but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect but ill sa
6749,2.0,i have been using the headset for months the battery life is pathetic it might huff and puff to hrs before the annoying your battery is low notification starts piercing your ears the noise cancellation is avergae and the mic is the biggest let down when i use this for calls when i am in my room my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us and the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the earholder kind of thing provided on the buds i wont recommend this to anyone i read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this most reviews were rating it pretty high so i have learned one thing do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers those might be paid ones happy shopping
6750,1.0,cover was dirty
6751,5.0,its hard to find a sweater that is warm and cozy but doesnt look bulky this sweater does it all it is delicate looking and soft and flattering it is also surprisingly warm i wear it with jeans for everyday but it looks good enough to wear out to dinner or such i bought the periwinkle which was the most flattering on me blond and fair i am hoping to get the green too when they go on sale i said it runs a little small because i took a small instead of my usual extra small in sweaters
6752,1.0,this shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures it is short and very wide i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid
6753,2.0,curious about the buzz this book has generated i picked it up prepared to be inspired i wasnt its a nice little fable one that you could even read to your kids but i didnt find in it any wisdom for the ages heres the basic message trust your intuition follow your dreams heard it before yeah i thought so there really arent any deep thoughts in the the alchemist its basically a kind of new age fairy tale it exhorts you to think big but doesnt really make you think too much some have compared it to kahlil gibrans the prophet not even close that thin volume makes you stop every few sentences to ponder its wisdom its not much of a story but its definitely deep the alchemist is exactly the opposite an endearing little story but no great strain on the intellect maybe it will cheer you up maybe it will give you the encouragement you need to chase your dream if so you probably didnt need much of a boost in the first place
6754,4.0,nice product camera is little weak rest is good works well
6755,5.0,really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different it fits tts but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress which is nice i am pounds and the size fit me perfectly

6762,1.0,it is waste thing to buy i used it just once and it showed battery low so i kept it for charging from past days still it is not on then charger wire even broke
6763,1.0,this laptop is very slow amazon arranged for a service engineer to attend the problem after that nothing happened we cannot even return the product even amazon arranged for a replacement all products are like this this is waste of money please dont purchase this and get disappointed i was even prepared to pay the difference and get a better one but was turned down now after the refusal of amazon to upgrade the laptop which was very slow we had to be content with the same totally disatisfied with the way things went on the devices rendered by amazon was also poor
6764,3.0,i purchased these pants in blue they fit great only problem is that one leg is about inch longer than the other i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix bummer
6765,5.0,awwwwwwwewwweeeeeeeesome
6766,4.0,nice book
6767,1.0,i really wanted to like this conditioner its decently priced and easily found however this conditioner did not do the job at all the bottle claims quota precious blend of moroccan argan oil which instantly penetrates the hair shaft while creating soft seductive silky perfectionquot sounds nice right now i usually comb out my hair with a wide tooth comb when my hair is coated in conditioner this conditioner did not detangle at all i had to use way too much to get it done and by that time i had combed out a fair amount of hair it has that generic cheap conditioner fragrance the ingredients arent really natural at all nor even organic as theyre name organix suggests the argan oil is pretty fair down on the ingredient list that should have been the first red flag did not leave my hair moisturized to get an idea of how much product i had to use to even get it to work to comb through my hair i have used half a ml bottle in a week i will never ever buy this again and although this is my first time trying this organix brand i doubt i will ever buy anything else from them either im going to use this up just because i hate wasting money and it wont take long either considering the amount needed
6768,5.0,superb and at this price unbelievable
6769,3.0,i received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strangeto tight in the bust and the arms were to big for mei am so bummedthe arms do not stay on my shoulders i have many tops but maeve and they fit me wellthis is the first one i have to return this top is made well and i do recommend but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you
6770,1.0,there is no second space and dual app option like other redmi handset totally money waste
6771,1.0,really disappointing
6772,2.0,i wasnt happy with this conditioner after my hg was reformulated aussie minute miracle i tried this one it smelled amazing but unfortunately did not live up to my expectations sure it smelled awesome in the bottle but it left no fragrance at all on my hair if that were the only issue i could live with it but unfortunately it didnt do anything for my hair at all it was dry and frizzy as ever i have curly and somewhat dry hair and the cap is curved so i cant flip it over to get all the product out alone i have to lean it against something and it keeps flipping over i will be using this to shave to use it up im going to try redken smooth down next
6773,5.0,we cant figure out how we lived without alexa in our house its so fun to walk in a room ask alexa what is the temperature and immediately know how to dress for the day as more skills are added and as your alexa adjusts to your speaking pattern it just gets better and better my husband and i have fun playing trivia games about past us presidents and oscar winners or quotes even jeopardy a show i dont watch is fun and they ask five question from the show that aired that same day checked that out one night look up the alexa skills that might appeal to you and ask her to activate them you can choose from many news sources to get a quick news update while youre making dinner if you get more than one you may communicate with people in the other room where the second or third echo dot is located intercom without wiring one of the newer skills is the ability to place phone calls check amazon for guidelines this joyful item periodically goes on sale so if its not urgent for you check back regularly for a reduced price its off today echo dot is also sold in packs of three in summary the echo dot is a great electronic delight to add to your home we added the soundbot sb bluetooth wireless speaker in the kitchen to make music louder when across the room from the echo this under speaker works like a charm not brassy and plenty of bass im guessing kids and grandkids would be entertained for quite a while as the two senior citizens in our house certainly are if you have an elderly or disabled family member alexa brings joy and communication to someone who might feel a bit lonely plus if you have an audible account what we used to call books on tape alexa will read them to you i could go on forever on the delight weve received from echo dot and alexa
6774,5.0,original apple phone i got happy thank you amazon
6775,4.0,this band just do the job very efficiently and the datas are very accurate compare to other bands in this price point

6777,1.0,i am not happy at all with the product so much advertisement and so little value i highly do not recommend this phone at all mp camera does not work at allif you select mp for capturing the phone it took at least sec to save the image and many a time it shows camera failed battery last only for to day only screen is good face unlock is good fingerprint is also good but you can add only three finger i mean seriously i bought the phone mainly because of camera and i am highly disappointed
6778,2.0,i waited a long time to get this top unfortunately i will be returning the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides not as pictured the sides should have been pleated it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing the design is unique and wish this top would of worked
6779,3.0,this sandisk uhs tf card is in good qualityhowever it is not working as fast as the class standard for operating a series of kb files it can only read at mbs and write at mbscompared to the samsung uhs microsd the samsung uhs card can at least process mb of kb files per second either reading or writing for readingwriting giant files this sandisk card can reach mbs for reading and mbs for writing which is acceptable for this price but still a bit lower than samsung
6780,3.0,wish this worked for me i am it is much shorter than it looks in the photo and the pockets did not hit my hips or torso in the right spot the neck was kind of tight on me too i love the idea of this dress but need it longer the dress is very roomy overall
6781,5.0,i can wear this to work or dress it up as a cocktail dress the fit is great and the quality is very high am usually a or a depending on the dress and the worked better in this one so if you are between sizes i would size down
6782,5.0,best qualitynext day delivery by prime
6783,5.0,love this top got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans shorts cropssome say its a little short and boxy while the style is cut larger i wouldnt call it boxy and i definitely didnt find it to run short a great staple wish it came in other colors besides white and blackgray
6784,2.0,worst mobile ever purchased bought it with lot of expectations from samsung as a huge brand but i think samsung is not concerned about its brand image by making such products apart from long lasting battery life nothing is appreciable my old mobile was much better than this
6785,1.0,there is a crack on the screen pls get it replaced
6786,4.0,because of how much i have been buying recently i didnt want to like this dress i just tried it on because its such a classic dress ill probably wear it all yearround dress it up or down and itll probably last for ages so i tried it and its cute and flattering and practical and the scallop neckline in the back is just enough of a tease to be fun without being too obvious it does get a bit cold though so adding a scarf is recommended though maybe not the davy crockett one the
6787,1.0,i was so excited to get this top in the mail i loved the colors print cut everything i put it on and was so disappointed the top looks so much better on the model i dont know if i should have gone down a size i go between an xs and s but it looked terrible on me my husband took one look at me in it and said thats being returned still disappointed
6788,3.0,there is some network problem in the product it is all good except
6789,2.0,i will not recommend this laptop it is dead slow taking long time even to get the login screen
6790,3.0,i purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve should have been a winwin the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult i had to add a slip that helped and figured that since im losing weight it would look better when im down a few more pounds that being said i didnt find it to be figure flattering i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to where i lo
6791,4.0,perfect delivery but package opening is critical
6792,5.0,i agree with another reviewer who said to get these while you can the fish print is adorable and you cant beat the style and uniqueness for this price i am lbs with long legs and a thicker waist normally wear size in pants and purchased these in size small i would definitely recommend sizing down the mediums fit me ok but the small was more flattering overall while still being roomy and having lots of flow cant wait to wear these
6793,3.0,this dress is stunning no doubt a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif thick material nicely cut with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly however the fact that this dress has zero stretch which is fine if thats what youre looking for coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured make this dress exhausting to put on im normally a at retailer and i ordered the just to be safe and the waist is exactly the size of my waist
6794,1.0,very poor quality pages looks duplicate returned the book the pages were very rough and turned yellow pathetic quality dont buy

6797,4.0,a good phone in this price range camera could have been better but display steals the showloving it really
6798,2.0,i have to assume that the brand new gb sandisk ultra class sdxc card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutterpausing that has happened since i started using it today prior to that never had an issue with my previous sandisk sdhc card but today on its maiden trip it has led each video only minutes long each to have several performance issues that by default i have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and ive never had an issue in the four months that ive had my galaxy note no problems formatting this card though or installingusing it otherwise
6799,1.0,i bought this phone and its like mobile iron too much heating problem battery back up is also very low better go for mi notes s or note

6801,4.0,alexa has so many surprising apps built in like the chat or compliments i can always depend on her for the news flash or for a surprise when i bid her good morning she doesnt have all the answers but who does she is a wonderful purchase that i am enjoying
6802,4.0,dont expect too much its a good phone compare to its price the only best thing about this phone is its os and battery
6803,5.0,this little puckshaped object is full of surprises and extremely useful not only do we use it daily to play music ask for spelling help but we also use it to find out current news listen to npr and podcasts and add items to shopping and todo lists that show up on the alexa app on my phone i can call out from the kitchen when i realize i need to add something to the shopping list without searching for a piece of paper that ill invariably forget at home once im at the store as a homeschool tool the spelling ability math calculations this day in history todays news and weather setting reminders and setting timers have all been invaluable yes there are times alexa cant help us been when working within her parameters we have been very happy we havent tried calling other echo users yet or find my phone but im sure those will come into play at some point
6804,2.0,i loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly the arm holes are entirely too big so big that alternations couldnt fix it maybe its because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw
6805,2.0,its sim slot is not working plz help me
6806,3.0,i have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips even a size is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer but a size in this would have been best on my hips the size was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body which made my waist look thicker than it is i thought my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice but i still didnt buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw
6807,5.0,beast phone under kmust buy
6808,2.0,i was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts unfortunately this fell short as it was huge not only was it big it flared at the bottom it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump but not what i am going for right now if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunicim sad that ill have to return it
6809,2.0,as i expectation its not good ie features finger sensor gallery voice etc dont buy it its only looking good or nothing also yet not credited cashback
6810,3.0,only few months gone and its started lagging stars only for brand value
6811,1.0,do not buy this dress for full price the design looks great but after receiving the dress the material is made of extremely cheap slinkyish polyester that you would find at a f store the stitching is horrific and created an uneven hump on the back seam just absolutely poor poor quality
6812,5.0,very nice product i use dash charger to charge it so it charges faster approx devices recharge from charge of power bank
6813,4.0,i felt like a year old wearing my big sisters dress its a bit too roomy and long for my frame in my normal size large hitting below my knees the top part fits my large g chest nicely but it becomes a wide aline through the hips the fabric is a bit thick like a sweatshirt knit so it doesnt flow softly over the body the fabric of the lace vee insert at the hem is thick and looks awkward i love the black and white stripes very striking would love a top in these colors and fabric
6814,4.0,excellent one by paulo coelho i liked this so much
6815,5.0,vry gud
6816,4.0,fingerprintlittle bit slow but its ok in this range cameracamera is very nice battery battery is also not good but its ok overall this fone is best ever vollour tooo
6817,1.0,was excited to wear the dress for the first time but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel strangest thing just a random hole appeared
6818,1.0,the product quality is so bad that it gave up with in months it doesnt turn on inspite of full charge cheap chinese product sold at very high price warranty services are also very poor and not efficient as against the tall claims nobody answers the call inspite of registering the complaint waiting for the replacement from last days i dont know whether it will happen or not have decided not to buy or recommend any more boat products henceforth
6819,4.0,battery lifegreat fingerprint okey cameragreat display great overall the phone is very good at this price but there is one problem that is phones back body it is not a metal body it have plastic or silicone body actually it is not a problem you just need a good back cover for its protection and hence your phone is ready to boost you the best thing is its weight and design having a very light weight and very good body design and also very comfortable to hold
6820,3.0,easy to carry n handle
6821,3.0,wore this romper x and after washing the hem on one of the shortslegs completely unraveled if i want to ever wear it again i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed unacceptable for a product cute design and good fit but questionable quality
6822,5.0,face recognition is quite effective and works well even in low light condition battery backup is awesome strongly recommend this phone
6823,3.0,price value phone but phone heating and voice problem

6948,3.0,i rate this as an ok product ive been using it for a little while now and find that it is quite good at achieving the straightening side of things as well as making my hair look a little shinier and smelling very nice too however for me it isnt hydrating enough my hair is very thick and dry so therefore requires a product that can provide moisture as well as good protection and straightening it claims to deliver big promises on the front of the bottle such as keratin proteins to help strengthen and soften the hair amp avocado oil and cocoa butter to smooth the cuticle but i cant say that the condition of my hair has improved dramatically nor has it become stronger or softer i think maybe if i had fine or medium thickness hair then it would probably work better but since i am a heat styling addict i dont think this works well for those with thick coarse or dry hair overall i wouldnt buy this again because it isnt hydrating enough for me i have used a lot better in the past but i would probably recommend because it isnt bad at getting your hair straight

6972,2.0,battery life
6973,1.0,its not working without being plugged to the electrical cord is it normal
6974,4.0,this skirt is a really beautiful print and made of a lovely silky fabric i didnt have the seethrough issue that the other reviewer mentioned my main concerns were the length im and it almost goes to my ankles and that it poofs out a little right below the waist band im between a small and a medium and went with the small it fits but i wonder if it would lie flatter and be more flattering if i had gone with a medium instead
6975,5.0,best power bank ever i am using this since years and yet its as new as it was no problem with product just buy it its value for the money u pay guys
6976,1.0,too costly for the specifications
6977,2.0,its not so much goid
6978,4.0,battery life is not so great within a month my battery life is
6979,3.0,its good
6980,2.0,it cant do google search dont act as bluetooth speaker requires amazon prime
6981,4.0,battery not seve in lifetime
6982,5.0,this is an excellent storage in the minimal space it come with the adapter so i am able to read in the regular sd card reader also
6983,2.0,my battery charger not working
6984,4.0,display is awasome battery is nice but camera quality is average my review is this now take your time to research before buying
6985,3.0,i ordered this in the mauve and its a really pretty lilac color unfortunately the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area but goes downhill from there the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front based on the model picture i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front its also very long completely covers my butt in the back and then some could of been a beautiful tank
6986,2.0,when i saw this jacket in store i fell in love with it the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous i am dd with petite frame i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality i ordered a petite m and it was no better i literally looked like a big marshmallowa linebacker the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc
6987,5.0,i love the style easy to wear to work or out for an evening great quality
6988,4.0,cute top wish they had xxs looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix i got an xs and lbs and its still a little wider than i would prefer but im not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those i decided to keep it since no xxs wore all day with jeans for a more casual event then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show super comfortable and looks great for all occasions
6989,3.0,i ordered this sweater in green in petite large the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably however the sleeves were very long for a petite i roll them and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve
6990,3.0,i got my normal size and unfortunately the moment i tried it on the details on both shoulders ripped the dress fit fine and i basically have no boobs so i dont think it was a case of it being too small i guess it just wasnt reinforced enough there was also a missstitch in the shoulder on the back which causes the back of the dress to bunch funnily lastly theres a slip on the inside which i dont think was necessary it hugs tight to the body and makes the whole dress feel oddly clingy
6991,5.0,this dress is perfect length right below the knee white slip lining adds to quality smocking fits upper body perfectly
6992,2.0,i was in love with this suit from the pictures unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesnt meet the bikini bottoms
6993,2.0,i ordered this in white and its quite sheer as others have noted it is really full and it hits at midhip which doesnt work on my figure if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic or less voluminous it could have worked but nope
6994,3.0,camera quality when i switch to wider camera angle flash is not working so i am unable to capture any moment in night with this feature also when i choose mp camera then filters are not working both functions are big disappointment for me else phone is good and worth to buy
6995,4.0,very cute print but runs large it is really long too
6996,5.0,product is totally money worthy its battery backup is amazing signal strength is awesome and android one no word for that camera is too good thanks xiaomi for making such device
6997,5.0,i am much happy and satisfied with the performance of this phone its my worth upgrade from iphone if you are iphone user better opt iphone instead xr my personal suggestion thanks
6998,4.0,the look is cute sound quality is good for a room but its not waterproof so be careful continuesly playing after getting and the battery life is superb a nice buy go for it
6999,3.0,not great speakers
7000,2.0,doesnt always give you the correct information and sometimes cant give any information its a hit or miss
7001,3.0,this and the conditioner are just ok it does fine and the conditioner is pretty moisturizing but its nothing special and i have found plenty of products that work much better for half the price will finish using what i have but will probably not repurchase
7002,1.0,paper quality is very poor
7003,3.0,impressive display unbelievable battery backupsmooth touch screenapps running very very smooth with samsung one uilight weightbut one big problem is cameraback camera cant captured detailing picturefront camera capture photos thats looks totally washed
7004,3.0,i really wanted to love this top when i got it but not so much it fit nicely through the bust and torso but flared out way too much it ended up looking like a maternity top maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape another thing it was very low cut i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath the fabric didnt seem to be the best quality it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package this shirt was not worth the price sadly this was a mis
7005,4.0,i love the concept of this dress i love the stripes ruffle hem and little cut up detail but it runs huge im lbs and typically wear a i went with the xs in this dress it flairs out significantly near the waist and hips which makes it super comfortable but not the most flattering i wish they had tapered it in slightly to give it a slightly more fitted look im keeping it and think it will be cute with booties in the fall but im not on it
7006,1.0,sr n deference
7008,3.0,this dress is beautiful it just swallowed my small frame whole the colors and design are gorgeous just not a good fit for me even at a p

7021,2.0,it works but the actual rw speeds are mbs not even class it should be marketed as sandisk basic not sandisk ultra unless they mean ultra slow now is and there is no excuse for such slow card from sandisk update i have redone the test with notepro instead of using non uhsi pc and the latest results are mbs since the read speed hits i believe the device is dhsi ready still underwhelmed by the write speed though
7022,1.0,pls dont buy very difficult to use alexa says most of the time i dont know what are you talking about pls dont make fool of yourself by purchasing this product
7023,4.0,finger print reader is good satisfying results camera quality ok i am not satisfied but compared with price range ok battery backup is fully charged that is for two days in normal using that means call attending facebook instagram etc display good easy handling size light weight compared with other mah battery phone fast charging is good all over good but camera suppose my expectation is high

7027,4.0,bought it during indian grand festival and the effective price was k after availing both prime members offer and sbi card offer performance is good enough for a phone less than k price range camera quality is poor but all other functions are pretty awesome
7028,1.0,insurance was auto revoked they said someone tried to register with the same product id this is unacceptable

7033,4.0,very good product with this price but purchase invoice not given invoice is madatory for warranty
7034,4.0,i ordered this top in small petite but wished i had exchanged it for an xsp because its wide in the arm holes but i love it nonetheless and wear it with a cami underneath i love that while its sleeveless the straps are wide this type of wide top is not for well endowed women up top i dont have that problem so it looks really cute i also love the length a lot of tops tend to be really long and for a petite person shorter tops look best

7056,4.0,reviewing after days of usage there are both pros and cons minimal of this device but overall a great vfm handset i aint a gadget lover but with the gradual usage i have started liking my recently bought samsung galaxy ms it has really impressed me a lot on many fronts performance on the exynos octa processor performs a lot better than the snapdragon which is fitted on any mss nearest competitors my buying decision was post a detailed analysis and comparison of samsung ms gb with realme xt and vivo zx with ms although i have not had experience of the later two but i did have experience of a xiami handset with snapdragon in the recent time and i did feel the difference during usage it is very smooth and there is no lag storage on i preferred to buy a gbgm combination and its huge no doubt about its massive camera out of impressed but not super impressed megapixel camera really gives you the details but low light photos werent that great worth to mention that the front camera has on screen flash which is really helpful attaching few pics taken from the ms camera for the judgment of the readers battery out of a super amoled display phone having a humongous a mah battery should ideally last very long as the power consumption by an amoled display is lot lesser that an ips lcd display a fully charged cellphone lasted about a little above hrs with full usage i expected a better performance of the battery drain post a usage of days at least charging out of real disappointment here its a fast charging phone but for the namesake only takes hours to charge the battery completely looks out of its a flop show here no premium feel and the black color does not impress may be i should have chosen a white one looks premium on the photo at least a back cover is highly recommended should be the usps processor excellent few dedicated on screen buttons video call smart view always on display where you need not to navigate through multiple folder and finally reach display i think one of the best thing to buy this phone is its super impressive super amoled display
7057,1.0,not getting connect with dell laptop
7058,4.0,i love this top very slimming and cool fabric only problem it is very delicate and will snag as a mater of fact mine arrived with a hole in the back im returning for exchange as i love the way the top looks but know i will have to be super careful not to snag the fabric

7060,4.0,using this headphones for year battery comes for a day for my usage the sound quality is really awesome the low end is also very clear
7061,5.0,i simply love it
7062,5.0,myself had sony earlier within a half years of lifespan it goes dead sony centre people said parts are not available so plan to purchase a new one while selecting thoughts were very clear best value for money brand panasonic best innovative brandlg best brand first sony second samsung after the past experience with sony this time opted for best value for money panasonic first impressionfabulous pros great picture quality stunning with ample bright scenes youtube amazon prime netflix inbuilt just one click operate sufficient connectivity ports hdmi usb digital audio out lan conventional pin type hdmi arc bluetooth butterly smooth operation sound quality mirror sharing not tested yet tb hard drive plays smoothly without any glintch ps plays amazingly capabilities of upscaling the picture cons blacks as compare to sony you may feel area of improvement now compare to economical brands flooded in market there is absolutely no comparision in terms of all aspects except price myself personally respect everybodys own aspect finally very much satisfied with the purchase thank you panasonic and amazon
7063,5.0,quite compact and fast phone
7064,5.0,beautiful top the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school its a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but its beautiful definitely worth getting
7065,4.0,audio sound is very low compare to miand there is no search option in call history
7066,1.0,worst phone ever
7067,4.0,this is not usually a top that i am attracted to but it is so cute paired with jeans and sandals nice lightweight top for summer
7068,3.0,this is a cute dress not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie
7069,5.0,va cnn jnbbnmknvbng
7070,3.0,my hair is wavy by nature and i do get some frizz i tried this shampoo because it was recommended to me i love the smell its not floral like other shampoos and almost has a cocoa scent to it my hair is definitely less frizzy but it doesnt work as well as so many reviewers have said it does
7071,4.0,great storage for the price per gb the only drawback is that they are rather slow to write to
7072,3.0,normal use
7073,4.0,dear sirmadam mobile delivered with bill and all accessories except warranty card and user guide on website of mi these are shown as package items kindly provide warranty card and user guide for delivered redmi pro asap
7074,3.0,this dress runs a bit small the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest also this dress seemed to make my belly protrude it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest not me
7075,2.0,i agree with all of the reviews the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on the buttons are a nightmare whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off ridiculous they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it so so so disappointing
7076,1.0,love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected it is soft to the skin and flattering however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders
7077,1.0,first time very bad experience from amazon i just today received my mobile when i switched on the mobile it switching off again and again when i tried to replace it there is no direct option to replace this product the app is taking me to the call option technical team is unable to understand my problem but they are not ready to replace my mobile i have bought around to mobiles many products from amazon but this time i am feeling really dissatisfied disappointed really bad experience
7078,4.0,has many uses i imagine its very entertaining for children as well has infinitely many possiblities for growth and additional tasksunderstands my voice perfectly for the most partonly negative thing i can say is the microphone is sometimes shody at picking up my voice and thats with it sitting on my desk no more than a foot in front of me so if you have a large room go with the bigger sized models
7079,2.0,i have fine dry and frizz prone colour treated hair and have used the shea butter vanilla silk and coconut milk shampoos and matching conditioners with great success it is difficult and expensive to find organix in europe so i tend to buy it in bulk on line i decided to try this for a change but so far i am not impressed according to the bottle it targets dry a brittle hair but it made mine feel like straw after i washed it it was a mess of tangles after rinsing and the conditioner did very little to help the situation my hair is dull and blah so disappointed it does smell very nice fresh and fruity lovely in the morning i will probably give it away or make my husband use it o
7080,2.0,its dis connect with phone while calling over phone
7081,2.0,as another reviewer wrote this is not the same jean featured on the website same cut and style but its a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out too bad they are cure
7082,1.0,i loved this tshirt when i first tried it on a good cutnot too drapey or fitted but then i washed it laid flat to dry and it shrunk so much that its unwearable now so disappointing
7083,4.0,bought it for rs if wanna know how than ask selfie camera good battery average use bracevor cover with it otherwise itll no more overall good budget friendly mobile
7084,2.0,i bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color i didnt have a problem with general fading but used natural mild stain remover biokleen and the pants were ruined one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark cold wash and line dried such a bummer that these pants arent every day wearable and washable
7085,5.0,i am not very sure of the accuracy because there are times that i am just not walking and travelling in a car but it still logs in steps and when i actually walk i think it doesnt represent the steps accurate although i would say it does do a good job of marking your sleep pattern
7086,1.0,i was so excited when i bought this product i used it about times for each time my hair became drier and drier my hair has never felt so coarse and dry i naturally have very thick wavy and semifrizzy hair this conditioner was the worse ive ever tried
7087,4.0,yes this smells somewhat odd a bit like bug spray but it does help keep my straightened hair straight despite living in humidland i find its excellent at taming any flyaways and also preventing frizz on all but the most excessive days of summer at for oz ulta its pretty good value too however it is very alcohol and artificial ingredientsheavy so i try not to use it too often keeping just to special occasions or on days when im not using bumble amp bumbles surf spray or thickening spray selena x my hg list as ive sampled many s of skin hair and mu products over the last decade and a half i thought it might be useful to share my top musthave products subject to change if and when i come across something more effective i love constantly trying out new stuff usually sample sizes via ebay also plenty courtesy of a friend who works at sephora hair loss treatment divine herbal hair oil lip balm nuxe reve de miel lip balm pigmentation antiageing treatment divine herbal facial treatment serum cleanser paulas choice skin balancing cleanser concealer mac studio finish concealer lash growth serum divine herbal divinelash foundationspf juice beauty stem cellular repair warm glow face scrub sisley botanical gentle buffing cream moisturizer antipodes rejoice light day cream hand cream origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment

7117,1.0,pathetic battery and the phone gets hot not even warm it gets hot dont buy this i bought it almost month back in now it has started giving battery issues hardly hr life worst wrong choice rest of the things are fine but if you have to attach wire to phone every few hours is absolutely waste of time i have to keep the charger all the time another major problem is the headphone jack i am really struggling to understand what cud be the logic behind not providing the direct headset option and why we have to use this extra wire in between i will not recommend this phone just because of pathetic battery and it keeps on getting hotter and i have to keep it out my pocket at time because of its hotness
7118,4.0,this shirt is very comfortable though its casual its uneven seams and asymmetry give it a little more edge and character fits true to size im lbs and was happy with the small

7120,5.0,i bought this mobile for battery life and im absolutely happy that this mobile could last more than a day beyond my extensive usage hours of calls multiple business apps thanks a lot samasung for the battery beast i had redmi a earlier which use to last hardly a day with full charge comparatively screen quality is quite impressive than a its been a fortnight usage over all experience is considering camera quality processing speed and fingerprint reader i havent tested with fast charging but it takes hrs to charge from with box charger i would suggest to go with this if you are looking for battery life budget mobile with all required features like fingerprint scanner good battery life etc cons no nfc support so contactless transactions not possible if you are serious about contactless payment just think no on screen fingerprint reader and in this budget segment with all features and back side reader this is ok with given charger it takes time to charge mobile so we may need to buy a fast charger separately no ear phones in box we have option to buy desired headset than getting a basic ear phones
7121,3.0,a lot of reviewers have been saying that this dress is simply too busy to be wearable and theyre right i love the cut and fit of this dress but dont love the style the awesome stylist at my retailer told me to take off the belt and then try it on with a ribbon like the one on the charisma sheath and it was so much more cute it completely changed the look of the dress and made it look more classy the belt looks very cheap in person and a little hoochie mamma if you wear it with the dress i
7122,2.0,have to admit i was a sucker for the packaging thinking how classy and luxurious it would look against my black and gold italian marble tiling in my bathroom alas for me that is where it ended having oily hair which has never been coloured virgin hair i found it was ordinary it didnt feel like it gave my hair any extra body or life it pretty much ceased to exist in its effect on my hair once it was suds at the bottom of the shower my boyfriend inherits any products i get bored with or am not crazy about like backups if he runs out and we havent topped up his usual shampooconditioner so this shampoo and conditioner ended up sitting in his shower after only using this product times it has since run out and the bottles are on my shelf back in my bathroom with shower gel in them resourceful
7123,1.0,having problem connecting internet i dont know what to do with alexa
7124,4.0,best display battery is mah but it drains fast so you can expect the battery backup of day with heavy usage finger print sensor is ok but not the fastest rear camera quality is good but not you can not compare it with sonys imx sensor which comes in one plus so camera is okay but mp shooter is just for the namesake it works like same old samsung a camera ui is very nice
7125,5.0,value for money good pic quality good sound wireless display amazing using from month thanks amazon
7126,5.0,one of the best product ever but be careful friends mi products are best products and affordable but once you slip these company mobiles in water thats it no body can save your phone

7129,5.0,perfect denim top the fabricmaterial is great and of good quality there is a structure to the top but it really makes the looks the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways for the quality a definite must buy
7130,3.0,camera was superb
7131,2.0,this was not nearly conditioning enough there was no slip to the hair at all for such a small bottle for the price i would expect this do to something other than smell good i would not repurchase any of these
7132,3.0,this jacket is extremely soft and comfortable with a heavier textured fabric i think it is expensive for what it isprobably best to wait for a sale
7133,2.0,evaluating the echo dot as a person with a very limited abilityunderstanding of electronic devices i have high hopes that in time i will learn to use many of the features at present because of my limitations im an owner of an arabian stallion but riding around on a shetland
7134,4.0,the most i like about redmi pro is the battery life with charge you can use a whole day with hrs of pubg with battery sacer mode you can use even longer annoying part is there is ad everywhere music player gallery file manager phone lags a bit when data is on which shows that some background process consume data and even with the ad option off you cannot escape camera is okay good with natural open lighting
7135,5.0,really useful around the house
7136,2.0,i ordered the black white petite im lbs and i order petite sizes all the time the length for the size i ordered is about on the back from neckline which is great for me however the length on the sides is way too short the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans not at all the way it shows on the model i would order regular length but then the sleeves will b
7137,2.0,pros cute packaging alot of natural ingredients cons does not do what it says it does my hair was left dry frizzy and with lots of flyaways too expensive for such a small bottle dont get lured because the bottle has such great things written on it
7138,4.0,the top itself is beautiful and colors are like pictured my only issue was the size i went for medium im usually m or l and im so i can get away with regular and pettite this top was way too long looked like dress on me im sending it back for exchange
7139,1.0,left earphone is not working properly voice is very low its in warranty how can i replace it
7140,1.0,this mobile is not having voice recording there is no display of incoming calls and outgoing calls time status frequently and automatically going to emergency call when the mobile is in lock and camera quality is not as this brand company claims doubtful on camera specification whenever money transaction is being performed its own keypad is overlapping and more chance for gathering pin and other confidential information this may be application problem but the quality of the product and its hardware maybe a good i feel the mi should take care on security like iphone and oneplus concerns on other application which gathering information i have doubtful on this product supportive application software
7141,4.0,you just need to be a little more careful but the unique popcorn stitch makes this an attractive statement sweater i am and lbs and was a little surprised how cropped the cut on the size small was compared to how it appears on the photographed models
7142,3.0,good device but flat base interesting in the begining but bored within few days it will be found in drawers or certain shelves we dont use after some times
7143,4.0,camera not be good
7144,5.0,i think this book should be must have for every english learner
7145,5.0,i love this shampoo and conditioner set i have been using it for months now with my curly frizzy hair sometimes i straighten my hair sometimes i leave it curly i use this conditioner pretty often almost every time i wash my hair when i do my hair curly i use at least a dollar coin amount and i squish it into my hair working my way up then i gently comb my hair using my fingers only i lightly swipe my hands over the roots of my hair to combat the frizz and then i leave the conditioner on for at least minutes my hair always rinses silky and no frizz maybe some of the other reviewers did not leave on this product long enough or did not put enough conditioner in their hair i definitely recommend this vanilla silk line
7146,4.0,cool little device very convenient and fun
7147,2.0,poor sound quality needs to be reset from time to time
7148,2.0,its pretty floaty feminine the photos dont do justice to the prettiness but the photos also dont show an asymmetrical hem i understood it runs small so i got two sizes to be safe and even my larger size was strangely shortwaisted and im shortwaisted to start with maybe i couldve lived with that but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any ive ever worn or seen before its not longer on just the sides the hem is longer in one spot on the front and one in the
7149,1.0,therd class products jo kuch bhi description me hai wo just tv sale karne ke liye image quality sd hd redy nahi koi bhi is tv mat money plus time waste

7151,3.0,not so worthy what you pay for this
7152,5.0,this skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous everything about this skirt works dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way and super comfortable no petite left so i purchased a regular and it fits perfectly i am ftin waist hips the hem falls about in longer than shown on the model this skirt is sold out fast no surprise it flatters all body types at all ages get ready for lots of compliments
7153,1.0,this product is not supported in lenevo k notedo not buy this
7154,1.0,waste of money sound quality also waste

7157,1.0,mobile very slow and screen quality very low speaker also poor sound quality censers are not working properly cameras also bad performance totally wast of money
7158,5.0,i received this skirt today and am absolutely thrilled as a short and curvy lady i feel most comfortable in fuller skirts but not too poofy and this one lies perfectly does not make my hips look wide the colors are soft and very feminine which also suits my style it may seem like a springtime skirt but i will start wearing it with tights and a sweater right away
7159,4.0,phone is as good as previous generation i am a big fan of ios only this reason buy this phone but if you have s dont go for not much improvement compare to s
7160,3.0,i received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however the color isnt quite yellow it has a little green to it kind of chartreuse i returned the item because it didnt look as good on me as it did on the pictured model this would probably look better on someone taller than me
7161,2.0,mic is not up to the mark you have to hold it close to your mouth to make it catch your voice sound quality is just okay with bass on the lower side overall it is not solving its purpose of being a mobile headset
7162,1.0,i donot feel this like a power bank i think it is not mph product if i charge it fully i am able to charge my mobile iphone mph only twice i am scared to take this for trip very very disappointed with this product
7163,5.0,this phone overall performance is good except to is fingers sensor
7164,5.0,i ordered two sizes up after reading reviews and added a belt for waist definition it is longi am six feet tall and it is perfect for me this is absolutely beautiful my husband loves the floral print and i received countless compliments after one wear the light flowing material swayed and billowed in the breeze of the outdoor wedding i attended very feminine and enjoyable to wear pricey but i felt i could wear spring through autumn love
7165,2.0,bought for my year old daughter at her request seems to be ok on her very thick slightly dry hair inexpensive or less at target update after a few weeks of use it is way too drying not good not gonna repurchase
7166,3.0,very good but for the rest of the world with limited functions
7167,5.0,was recieved in very good condition and was cleana must read read book but start with rich dad and poor dad
7168,2.0,bought a new iphone s which got delivered well before time however the sim card slot is not working
7169,4.0,great over all experience but screen resolution is visible how its different from other screen
7170,2.0,im on the shorter side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer this is a lovely suit but it didnt work at all for me it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all it was very tight and pinched sadly i returned it
7171,5.0,good one free ram around gb okay one for normal users high contrast display full hd the camera is average the battery is awesome around hours sot charges in hours minutes
7172,3.0,epectations is not full fill average out of becausecause this product is budget segment thats only reason
7173,1.0,worst experience and bad product even for st boot its not loading and in boot loop for hours with attempts of force restart its still stuck samsung have it in dna to be bad production quality and over the top it was sent in a normal amazon polybag packaging in place of bubble protective package and wonderfully kept under pile of items in the rug bag of the delivery person
7175,3.0,product good but current show backside in testeron all steel part
7176,5.0,there is nothing really to say except that i love having this much storage and not having to worry about running out
7177,4.0,i really enjoyed the fragrance of the mao shampoo and conditioner and found that the conditioner really detangled and soothed my hair it also gave my hair body and definition and defrizzed it its definitely not as moisturizing as other conditionersbut maybe thats what i like about it
7178,4.0,awesome battery life user interface is also good with an eye catching look
7179,2.0,i liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering they are scalloped at the hips so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all
7180,3.0,i really like this shirt but its a bit maternity i dont mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here im about and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret since im done having kids it has to go back its also somewhat see through and had i kept it i would have worn a tank top underneath as long as these things dont bother you it really is cute
7181,4.0,budget friendly phone with all available features
7183,2.0,beware white is not white white is more cream offwhite light beige i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color they are cute but not white i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer but unfortunately creamy colored shorts dont do much for navywhite topsalso the button is very difficult to opencloseotherwise they are ok
7184,3.0,love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back also it is a flowly top so you will need to size down however because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chestarms this didnt work for me as it accentuated my normal body type as in not the model type i am not overweight but it definitely didnt flatter my chest area seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first
7185,1.0,worst mobile ever seen it hungs while using any application installed in very frequent intervals except camera performance is very very poor hardly responds sucks all the time
7186,3.0,i love this blouse but my normal size didnt even come close to fitting me i think i would have had to go sizes up too bad cause it is a beautiful top not good for us busty girls though
7187,1.0,never buy this product its indidplay finger is not working
7188,2.0,installation of tv is not done as hrs gone after deliveryso pls arrange as early as possibleno one contacted me till todaykevin no does not respondpls look in the matter
7189,4.0,its relatively light material even if you layered a sweater over this i cant see it being good for winter im in california so its fine length is great im and it hits just at the knee im a true size small and this fit great even though i have a curvier figure pretty classic dress
7190,4.0,i would describe the color as more blush the fabric does not have a sheen as in the model picture the fit is much cuter on than hanging im a c and the extra small is just a bit tight in the bust otherwise i like the fit everywhere else im going to order a small and see how it fits at its also longer on me than on the model but not a deal breaker looks kind of s vintage on my fabric is not see through its more of a twill fabric but not quite as heavy as that
7191,2.0,i really wanted to love this shirt the snowflake and stripe design is really cute and the fabric is of nice quality its a very loose fit which i wouldve been willing to work with but as mentioned in previous reviews the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms not attrac
7192,1.0,the fit on this shirt is bizarreit very much resembles a nursing top but wouldnt actually work for that purpose the side visible in the picture is nicely draped but the other side can flap open and is completely different i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate
7193,2.0,phone utna fast nhi jaise ki aur sab h camera quality v average h agar dusre phone se tulna ki jay to dhundhla dhundhla pic ata h samsung camera mp sirf naam ke liye finger print kafi slow h mere redmi note ki tulna me battery achcha h but kafi time lagta h full charge karne me se ghante lagbhag aur sabse bakwas ki inke box na to koi back cover h aur na hi koi screen protection glass ye sare review weeks use karne ke bad h maine ise me liya tha weeks me hi isme halke halke scratches aa gaye h isse acha realme note pro h jiska camera isse bahut achcha h isme sirf naam ke liye mp h
7194,2.0,a beautiful shawl but not practical i was impressed with how elegantromantic it first feltlooked however after minutes of wear it would not stay on my shoulders the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different topstanks underneath i kept running into the same problem lovely for the first minutes of wear and then awkwardlyannoyingly wouldnt stay on my shoulders the neckline is undefined and it just fell off not a great design disappointedly returned it
7195,3.0,sound not as clear as original
7196,2.0,first its huge im not big busted but its so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant not exactly what i was going for nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it inand im short waisted so no tucking for me back it went
7197,4.0,very good phone i got this phone of gb model in but sometime when i make a call the speaker or mute button will be pressed might be due to sensor issue if they resolve this issue overall its a good phone
7198,2.0,not good phone
7199,5.0,overview samsung ms is a wonderful power pack monster that comes with mah battery in terms of look and feel its a very nice phone with samoled screen pros mah battery that last for almost days on regular use bigger and easy to hold fhd screen with x pixels triple rear camera setup with also supports wide angle shots feature of ar emoji which can turn your face into emoji smooth oneui skin cons the speakers are not so loud fast charging is not so fast it takes arround hours to charge battery to full verdict samsung is a well know name and we know it doesnt compromise with quality its really a good bugdet segment phone with triple rear camera setup go for it if you want bigger battery perfect screen quality
7200,1.0,problem in this product
7201,2.0,poor quality productl with pixelated screen i would normally buy from amazon considering buyer protection but am being refused a refund folks considering this are better off buying from a local store after checking

7207,4.0,its good and does the job
7208,2.0,remote is not working and also installation boys are not came
7209,2.0,material was a tad rough for my liking the color did nothing for my olive complexion given the price of this shirt even with off i dont think its worth it if im spending on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this onegoing back
7210,3.0,as samsung stated a monster for monster performance but the actual product doesnt meet with their claim mobile is loaded with mp camera and mah battery but none of them do their job as they supposed to be the pictures capture by the back camera lacks in detail and front camera is kind of worst thing i have ever gone through the claim about the battery is also seems to be false battery performance is equivalent to mah battery the good part about the mobile is samoled display facial unlock in show poor performance as it unlock the phone even when eyes are closed and is slow
7211,3.0,nice lines just a bit tight if you have larger more muscley shoulders
7212,5.0,excellent product at best priceloved the product its fully fine and delivered on time
7213,5.0,i love it now i have music in my home look mom no tuner
7214,2.0,battery life is too bad
7215,2.0,upon first purchasing this product i liked the packaging and what it was supposed to do for my hair after a few months of use i wasnt as pleased with the results it made my hair feel dirty faster like a film over my hair but only noticed this after trying out another product that was supposed to provide the same results and didnt weigh down my hair
7216,1.0,dear all i have purchased as it was been wrongly advertised please dont buy samsung is cheating us very poor quality and you cannot return also screen is broken received fault device please read other comments too its totally waste of money
7217,5.0,this sweater is way cuter in person the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater also it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front really cute and soft not itchy highly recommend
7218,3.0,easy to product am using no company
7219,5.0,great operates as expected
7220,2.0,the noise cancellation was not good in this product it doesnt seams clear
7221,2.0,iam not satisfied
7222,2.0,the earphone is fine the wire is way too long which is annoying during worouts the wire at the neck is way too thick seems like wearing a hairband around the neck i do not like it for that reason it will just keep shifting from one side to another and will distract you during workouts dound quality is good however the bluetooth range is not so good it starts to disconnectent while moving in the gym from one side another
7224,1.0,front camera picture quality is not good and battery backup is not best after months i face major problems like valum button calling voice

7229,3.0,cant hear me across the room
7230,4.0,nicebut no fhd
7231,3.0,the skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach you cant really tell from the pic but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut im pretty slim and pounds and it wasnt doing me any favors the top of the dress is beautiful i will exchange it for something else i ordered it online and couldnt try it on before purchasing it
7232,5.0,very comfortable well made great with leggings or skinny jeans
7233,1.0,ive been buying from retailer for the last years and this is the first time ive ever posted a bad review first of all the fabric is scratchy thin and looks very cheap second of all there is no v back its more of a slight scoop and lastly im so i ordered the petite small and its still comes inches below my knee i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup
7234,5.0,i really like this phone features and a very good performance of phone all is good in this phone till now i dont get any negative point on this phonereally good phone and really good camera phonekeep it up realme
7235,4.0,good puck just add speakers
7236,4.0,ram management is the biggest issue in realme devices hope they will look into it
7237,2.0,the speakersound on this is just horrible compared to the full sized echo and the tap
7238,4.0,there is no call recording option
7239,3.0,clean sound and good bass gives good punch for the size of the speaker very small in size compared to the photo
7240,2.0,the problem is its battery life worst i had boat rockerz which worked so well once charged also it has a very abrupt behaviour when discharged i had kept it on charging for good hours and when turned on it started saying battery low in mins then switched off i put it on a car usb charger for mins hardly n it said the sound quality is just ok not sure of its real or fake coz its just like any other local earphone brand you will start feeling headache ear ache if you are using it for long time also the charger provided with the product is cheap low quality and the wire is very small in length the magnets are not quite working only good things about the earphone lightweight and good color the earbuds are fine as they fit in and do not get off easily in case you go on a running or something while these are on
7241,5.0,the phone has a crazy level of performance i was totally confused btw opt and v but after so much of thinking after so watching so many comparisons i finally decided to go with view the only con is that it has a little bit of screen bleeding issue but trust me that doesnt effects pubg at its best camera is beast with whooping mp shooter many complain about camera because by default it shoots with mp shooter i m not a good photo graphed but will surely share my shotscharging speed is very nice with the supercharged w tech overall u will definitely love it and it is definitely better than opt until ui is the thing for uto concern about night mode is really fabulous

7246,4.0,i love the fit of these pants starts for that i wish the pockets were a little closer together but its not the end of the world considering how well they fit the real drawback is that the dye runs like no other pants ive had before i had them on for a few hours and my fingernails had turned green and my skin was a greenish color i am going to try to soak them in water a few times to see if that helps i would still recommend these pants but wash them a couple times before you wear the
7247,2.0,no way
7248,2.0,i loved the fact that this dress is cotton it is a thin cotton and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap mine came with a nude slip im thinking they all come with a nude slip im not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine wont tear easily or to retur
7249,5.0,very comfortable fabric and fits nicely i am like it states the model is and it falls shorter on me that viewed but still looks nice it will be an easy dress to use for different looks

7252,2.0,i bought it as an upgrade for iphone s and its been dismal purchase in about years time its battery has gone for a toss especially after moderate usage of internet not more than hours s is still better than this apple might have reduced the price from k to k but its still not worth it once a great fan of apple i see now no point to use its phone as it seems to have intentionally slowed down the phone and done something to kill the battery
7253,2.0,the case did not fit and i spent hours trying to get it to connect to my internet i almost sent it back it then connected to my neighbor big echo and wouldnt disconnect after messing with it for a but i final got it to work i wish i could afford the big one but it is so expensive i feel i would like it so much better

7264,2.0,there isnt a whole lot that i did like about this dress the shoulders have large poufs the fabric isnt very soft and its not flattering maybe with a belt i could be tempted but i wasnt too fond of the dress
7265,5.0,not best but a better option under the budget of
7266,3.0,this top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model it was not flattering for my larger bust with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist the quality is nice the fit in the shoulders is snug the length is a bit short for me but it may lay better on a different body type
7267,5.0,id been eyeing this dress since it first appeared online but when i went to order there was no petite sizing then when shopping i noticed the carbon color in the petite section of my local retailer i grabbed my usual ps and although it was okay i decided to try the xs for comparison the slightly closer fit made all the difference suggesting that i had a figure underneath but not tight anywhere nice weight to the fabric it drapes beautifully and the lacing detail is very popular now a
7268,3.0,as much as i had wanted this to work for me it didnt fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad i purchased this online on sale at and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow i sent this back to the store as it didnt seem fit even at the low price
7269,1.0,camera is not good camera quality is like mp
7270,4.0,it packs quite a punch and offers a refreshing break from the crowd of affordable chinese smartphones promises good value for money it is not the best looking phone in this price rangetalking about the quality the cameras of the galaxy m are capable of shooting some great photos under good lighting conditions battery is one of the core strengths of the device it is among the few phones that offer a mah battery
7271,3.0,this sweater is huge i usually wear a small ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it i like big sweaters but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous

7273,5.0,works just fine thia card being so big will slow down your phone a little bit but works fine for me
7274,3.0,cons phone is not hd so videos in facebook is coming with not so much clear compared with other redmi phones size is also very odd means length is bit longer and width is bit shorter which create problem in single hand operation back camera quality is not so good flash is also not upto the mark picture is not very prominent while zooming or in low light pros battery back up is good even after usage of net hrs last for days front camera is superb front screen flash also fulfill the purpose no hanging issue or heating issue
7275,1.0,dont purchase them one of the headphns stopped working after few days of use
7276,5.0,vale for money and great offers

7284,4.0,it took me few days to start using the phone as i was travelingmeanwhile i was reading the reviews other fellow buyers of ms in this forum and especially those low scored reviews caught my attention i just want to ask you all a question how could one just give star rating for this phone ya there are some kind of draw back or touch points which does not meet ones expectations in any product but star is unwarranted this phone is way worthy than star easily personally i cant ask for more for this pricing its brilliant strategy to disrupt the cluttered chinese brands good effort samsung
7285,3.0,all good but apps cant download from gplay some software problem is there
7286,1.0,cemera is good and phone is strak only one speakar is working and no memory card and earphone cable not their only battery usb two is one only

7292,2.0,the dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling the fabric will only get worse with wear return cute concept poor fabric quality
7293,2.0,kindly read carefully if you going purchase this galaxy m first there is a big problem with this phone is network issue heating problem battery back up is also not as expected its equal to mah if compare with other mobiles camera quality is also not good weak pixel quality processor is also old its working slow legging is there slow finger print sensor only one thing is good you will get proper notifications voice quality is also not good its annoying its a worst product by samsung now i have no faith on samsung this type phone not expected from samsung we cant compare this phone with any other brand under rs i want to return this phone but there is no option for refunds after purchasing once you can only replace cant get refund
7294,4.0,not up to expectations

7299,4.0,great display better than average music quality very good camera better os than stock android however the plastic body feels fragile and back vibrates with speaker during calls
7300,5.0,this does the same thing as the large version but its much smaller and you can put it in a place out of site we have it in our bathroom to enjoy music or whatever while getting ready for our day
7301,3.0,reviewtextreadmorev dataenableyoutubepreviewtrue dataproductid datareviewid datatextthis treatment is not all that special it really is just average but i would not say that it is horrible because personally i would buy again i really like the smell and my hair use to be real spongy but now is not and i guess some people would like that but i can understand how some would not like the weigh down other than i like that it is sulfate free however if you have real damaged hair i do not think this product is all that renewing this treatment is not all that special it really is just average but i would not say that it is horrible because personally i would buy again i really like the smell and my hair use to be realdiv
7302,1.0,i ordered a size in the orange it ran a size smaller than normal size maeve tops the quality of the material was terrible it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath that messes with the look of the lace on the top the color of the orange was gorgeous
7303,3.0,i had a few pairs of these highwaisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person unfortunately the cut is different the sides covered here by the models hands flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates the top is not the definitively highwasted height from last year i dont own anything else highwasted being an apple im generally a lowrider owing to a small hipsbutt
7304,2.0,camera very poor screen quality is low
7305,3.0,writing after one year of purchasing product is super sound quality portability everything is nice but after one month of use started the bluetooth connectivity problems and the feeling is very disappointing
7306,4.0,nice for getting motivated
7307,2.0,pros good battery life camera quality seems to be just okay cons position of earphone jack is really weird length of phone is too big doesnt slip well in a formal pant pocket network as per my experience was better with motorola phone its really poor with network connections bulky in weight
7308,3.0,pretty tee but not worth the price lace is beautiful but fit is blah
7309,5.0,using since weeks its quite nice no wall mount required as it has wall mount with it
7310,4.0,love this shirt with leggings if you are in between sizes size down
7311,2.0,battery capacity should be more very bad thing is theres no mm audio jack separately
7312,2.0,i bought this product one month ago i faced a screen issue where phone internally works but i couldnt see anything on display i hope manufacturers should show some care in making within we cant expect to rush to service center
7313,1.0,the mic is not goodsound quality is nice while using this for calling and gaming the other person cant hear you well since the mics quality is bad i wouldnt recommend this product is youre a gamer
7314,3.0,thanks for amazon for genuine product and safe delivery couple of month back i bought this mobile for i am quite shock to see the reduction in price however the mobile works absolutely fine and truely a flagship phone smooth ui outstanding camera and average battery life while business people who are into phone in most of the hours will feel heavy because of mobile weight gm my hands started to feel heavy during long calls and using applications if you are not an ios fan i would suggest oneplus that deliver same features with less phone weight comparatively
7315,1.0,all contact photos are getting blurred within seconds of saving in contact anyone facing this issue please help
7316,3.0,its okay product
7317,3.0,camera is good bt i think aage khud samjh lo
7318,3.0,i have a collection of this artists paintings throughout my home she is a favorite i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer i ordered it at fullprice it looks the same in person as in the photos the fit was true to sizeit fits me as shown on the models the knit was comfortable the problem was the printed fabric it was so flimsy and kept attracting static no matter what i tried i couldnt get the static problem solved it was unwearable because of how messy
7319,1.0,dont ever buy it trust me its not worth the things you have to face none of the app will get installed you cant install it in any manner no proper technician neither the companys own they have the service contract partner they dont have oem android os as well its a crack built
7320,5.0,i bought this at the retailer store the other day and i wore it to work and i received so many complements it has the perfect amount of swing and hides your middle without looking frumpy i got the blue color and wore it with skinny jeans and ankle boots the red is really more of a bight pink color not a rich red as pictured i wish it came in more colors and patternsmaybe green or purple it does run big i usually take a large but a medium was perfect
7321,2.0,this is a crop top but super boxy and wide i expected it to be more fitted in the waist since it sits out away a from the body a lot it was not flattering i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and im willing to pay full price for something that works
7322,1.0,unfortunately this top is shirtlength and im only needs to be about longer made of sweatshirt material which i wouldnt mind if it were longer also runs very wide ordered an xs and could have gone smaller
7323,2.0,what a waste of money honestly this did nothing for my hair i gave it to my mother to use as a heat protecting when she straightens her hair
7324,4.0,product was delivered in time excellent case provided by jbl in terms of packaging itself although expensive the product quality and sound is too good the sound doesnt faulter at high volume bluetooth connectivity is very good too the depth of the sound and bass is awesome compared to other similar products of various brands surround sound effect is also great havent tasted the water resistant ability battery life is sincerely good mic for the phone isnt good this review is for this product which is almost a couple months old with me
7325,4.0,very good phone display camera and bettery life is very good best phone in this price range big bettery life and fast charging
7326,1.0,not impressed with the camera i dont find the mp camera to be any good
7327,4.0,nice phone for selfies lovers big screen clear hd display battery is ok good phone on this price
7328,2.0,i was so excited to try this shampoo and the conditioner as ive heard so much about this brand and my mom adores it and she normally uses pureology but this was worse than useless for me the hair right above my neck felt like it had a film over it not greasy but like the conditioner never washed out and the rest of my hair was not smooth or soft it was almost frizzy dry unruly i refused to believe it was this stuff but after reading the lowest reviews on ulta and seeing that others were having the same complaints i decided to dump this shampoo and conditioner
7329,3.0,im not finding that many uses for it
7330,1.0,piece of crap doesnt understand half of what you say randomly answers questions you didnt ask and now cant connect
7331,3.0,the title of this book is incorrect because name suggests it is a motivation type book but its a story of a girlbut its ok to read not so bad not so good
7332,2.0,a lot of things it cant answer
7333,1.0,poor sound quality regretting
7334,4.0,as per pixel camera quality is good
7335,4.0,love the feminine take on flannel and how it fits like a tailored shirt i am a bit long waisted and the side slit reveals a little too much when i lift my arms if the shirt was just a little longer it would be perfect
7336,5.0,it is heavy and big but charges fast
7337,1.0,i bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings i thought the price was great too good to be true you get what you pay for once i opened the box they smelled awful it was a chemical smell i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better i have washed the gray times and it still smells
7338,3.0,not for petite women you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment
7339,2.0,the design and style of shirt is quite cute but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base
7340,5.0,love this top so soft fits perfect
7341,3.0,i love so much about it it really is a gorgeous piece i just cannot get over the shorter sleeve theres something about it that makes me feel like it looks as though i bought it too small or shrunk it in the dryer im the only one commenting on that so it must be me lol i think im going to begrudgingly return this one
7342,5.0,love it i have parkinsons and it has made everything so much easier i wish had the echo and various controls in the house ie lights fans and switches life could be so much easier
7343,1.0,gets overheated and then keeps on restarting on its own i actually had to keep it in freezer for few minutes to avoid the processor to burn out one more drawback is that while in pocket the finger print automatically unlocks the phone and unknowing does things on its own so please dont buy this phone its very poor mindless design by samsung
7344,2.0,i tried this it was meh not very hydrating and didnt make my hair feel soft it works just like a bottle of suave shampoo in my opinion i replaced this with something more hydrating and im now using this as a hand soap haha
7345,1.0,old product received manufactureree in november with very improper packing conditions
7346,1.0,quality not up to the mark moreover amazon doesnt care
7347,3.0,tried this on and loved it except for one thing the sleeves are split so any movement reveals most of your arm shoulders which also makes it fairly impractical for winterthe office yes i could wear a sweater or blazer with it but that defeats the purpose of having an allpurpose cute top why retailer this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc but the split sleeves make it a nogo
7348,4.0,camera little bit low
7349,3.0,after playing one to three games my phone is over heating that sucks
7350,1.0,everything is good but durability sucks and that means the product is really waste i have it since months and one on side has already stopped working i wouldnt buy it again and you shouldnt buy it now
7351,5.0,what is this thing oh yeah a memory cardit does what it says and nothing elsekeep remembering things even when you forget like my last girlfriend
7352,5.0,fast easy and great amount of capacity xc is pretty quick and i am enjoying mine on my galaxy s
7353,5.0,i was looking for budget tv and found this with good reviews and in budget after using this for almost months i think i made the great choice picture quality is good performance is awesome just couple of thing to note is the audio quality is not good with high volume remote has basic functions so if you wanna search something on youtube or any app it will be nightmare you need to buy a remote with keypad for that other than that its simply superb
7354,5.0,i love this cardigan its fit however really depends a lot on an individuals height and build i am about lbs i have slim arms and am larger in the chest my typical size in retailer clothing is m having said that i found that in this top a s fit best it made a difference with how the pockets and lapels lay the pants you wear may affect the look when you snap it closed wearing leggings or slim pants ex pilcro cords gave a much more flattering look to my backside jeansnot so muc
7355,1.0,cabinet build quality is very poor lcd fitted in pannel is very loose and there is free play in between
7356,1.0,phone not getting on even after charging
7357,4.0,this top is very nice heavier weight linen i normally wear a small or size in retailer but this seemed a bit on the larger size than normal its still great quality and ill probably keep it a great item to wear for a long time
7358,3.0,im currently using it for my nokia lumia and my camera works very well and very fast but expensiveedit i was really happy with the card until i had to record video on it it seems that it doesnt write fast and my recordings end up being choppy and unwatchable i was really disappointed in it cuz i had to switch back to my phones storage when recording video
7359,4.0,i knew this jacket would be mine as soon as i saw it online but i also have a hard time trusting retailers online photos by their color and angle etc i took a gamble and for the most part it paid off i do like the jackets unique bohemian gone chicuptown styling and the gorgeous patten with a spattering of embroidery on the chest and back what i dont like is the mix of black leather trim and big brass studs i feel like there might be one too many ideas or they could have been toned
7360,5.0,excellent super fast ios
7361,3.0,cute stripes and soft but very pajama top like in feellook like if you wear it out people will assume youve got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home
7362,2.0,its not horrible but for the price i think a one dollar shampoo works exactly the same the only good thing is the smell but other than that it sucks i have to use like a quart of the bottle to make my hair feel clean and to make it lather decently so if you have long ba curls steer clear of this product
7363,3.0,hi my name is seshu i took this product on th march too much noice disturbance when iam in call one more thing not even months already one of side is not working properly charging and sound quality is good they assured that one year warranty and if anything happens to that product replacement too
7364,3.0,nice product for basic use
7365,4.0,battery life good
7366,3.0,this top light and airy which is perfect for spring im usually into these types of blouses however this didnt quite fit right on me its a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason i loved the design and really wanted to like it i just didnt love it enough to purchase it
7367,4.0,decent phone the phone has a great display battery life was great in the beginning but once even if unintentionally your battery is nullified your battery life becomes hell youve to charge times a day on normal usage plus fast charging turns into normal charging takes approximately hrs or more to fully charge from to remember keep the battery above or your battery will become unstable processor is decent not that great compare to snapdragon processors trust me my experience with this phone has been better than i ever had with a chinese or xiaomi phone
7368,4.0,i am a horse lover so i had to have it as it is of good quality and unique be mindful that it runs small and fits alittle snug across shoulder also excellent for layering
7369,2.0,to be frank and direct this conditioner didnt meet my hairs standards for me i like my conditioners to moisturising and this did not do well even with an adequate amount of conditioner it wasnt enough to soften my hair throughout two days on the first day my hair felt soft manageable and silky i was able to run my hair through it without any tangles however on my second day i dont know why but immediately it starts feeling rough tangled and a bit dry magically on the second day it just seems like my hair wants to stop having a soft silky structure but rather transform into a tress that is simply unmanageable i have fine straight hair the conditioner is not moisturising one quarter through the product i found it didnt give enough softness to endure for two days i will continue to finish this product but i add another conditioner for more silkiness and smoothness its simply not enough to continue the softness and only after one day with hair down or up it was just not satisfying the price for this product in australia is pretty expensive from in us to around in australia for just the one for this i wouldnt be repurchasing my only positive point is that it does gives you the shine i always wash out the conditioner with cold water but i used warmhot water because the weather was freezing one time and it still gave me the same result super shiny everytime you move the shine moves with you i guess the packaging appeals to people it appealed to me
7370,5.0,this is an awesome and amazing product
7371,2.0,this is another one of those darned swing tops i cant even with this trend this shirt has such a nice printcolor palette going on but its ruined by the swing cuthenley combo it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized mens night shirtsmock i dont know it was just not at all flattering i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes this just made my
7372,4.0,the phone was delivered on time but i message and facetime is not getting activated on the phone also i phone is getting overheated
7373,3.0,camera quality is worst it give blur images battery life is average not like mah fingerprint sensor doesnt recognize sometimes face lock is also having problems after using an month phone get hanged and it also get heated while charging or talking i personally recommend please dont buy it its all wastage of money better go for redmi note pro
7374,2.0,it says that we get an in box fast charging adapter of w but it was a regular w charger inside seriously didnt expect this from samsung how can a regular w charger charge mah battery quickly
7375,3.0,the front and back of this square sweater are the same and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like its on backwardsthe lace would be nice but its itchy and the sweater is cropped so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body the sleeves make it look small and fitted but the body shape is bulky just couldnt get it to work
7376,4.0,pretty cool gadget im sure ill find more utility for it as time goes on
7377,5.0,one of the best in this price nothing to complain display sound connectivity and camera all are up to mark go for it its a beast
7378,1.0,product not working within month from purchase
7379,5.0,amazing product and always apple is apple
7380,5.0,first look and experience its superb
7381,5.0,great read and write speed compared to my old transcend of course that was a class and this is a uhs i am very satisfied with the price i got it at and sandisk limited lifetime warrantyoh yeah i asked for the original manufacturers packaging but i got amazons frustration free packaging instead no big deal though
7382,4.0,it is a good offering but still samsung gives half what other offers in same amount and technology
7383,3.0,battery backup
7384,4.0,overall phone bhut hi badhiya haibattery life bhut hi achi hai saath hi charging speed bhi achi haikuch jagaho pr network ki problem aa skti haiphone ka rear or back dono camera ka day performance kafi acha hai night mai thoda disappoint ho skte haifingerprint sensor bhi badhiya tarike se kaam krtabody thodi weak lginina back cover ke scratch nazar aa skte hai back cover hote hue bhi kuch scratch nazar aaye phone ka performance bhi badhiya hai
7385,5.0,love love love it is a little boxy but it is soo soft and comfortable it does run at least a size or big i picked it up in the pink color yesterday at me local retailer store was not sure about it when i first saw it online but fell in love with it quickly when i tried it on great sweater for fallwinter
7386,2.0,i purchased this product on but not satisfied sound is also normal and right side is not working only side is working
7387,1.0,the colours are not proper
7388,2.0,i had chg the very next day since the instrument defective
7389,1.0,dont buy this product very bad quality only font camera is good averagein low light font camera is just bakwash but back camera is very bad ram management is very poor not able to hold apps ignore realme phones because the colour os suck os automatically close gaana app in background while listening songs
7390,4.0,very nice bookit might get repetitive sometimesbut must read once at least
7391,5.0,amazon price of this phone is lowest rs battery backup is superb among all iphones k video recording on fps is awesome with stabalization my first iphone and i am very happy for this incredible deal thankyou amazon
7392,2.0,my earlier mobile was one plus texchanged the same to this pro but quiet dissapointed with call voice qualitysound is very less for both handset as well as speakerand camera quality is also not satisfiedother media sound is good enough
7393,1.0,i had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver wouldnt recommend it
7394,1.0,received this product promptly thanks to amazon phone is swift touch is smooth and there is no lag observed whatsoever but battery drains pretty fast with my moderate usage my redmi pro used to run for days on single charge but this phone runs only for few hrs if you are a person always connected and having requirement of more screen time then please avoid buying this phone you will end up spending more time charging than surfing
7395,1.0,i have bought this mobile before month mobile is good but after month that mobile automatically switch off and deid its was totally manufactur mistake but mobile was repaired under warranty but ultimately im disappointed because i have lost my all data
7396,2.0,after using a couple of days i felt bad in choosing this model touch it is not that much sensitive somtime i feel it is hangstruck network with my old honor phone i have not noticed any network problem at home and office but this phone is having very poor network connectivity battery it is not giving two days of backup even without gaimgonline streaming finger print it is taking long time to identify the finger and unlocking the device think twice before buying
7397,4.0,bought this for my mother it is good phone for people having limited usage of applications touch is good camera quality is good a good phone to gift to parents
7398,1.0,this phone has a very poor picture quality being a mp sensor camera quality is way less than a mp redmi phone what you see on the screen while clicking and what you view in gallery are entirely different coming to camera modes just slow mo modes perform well if you are buying this phone for good camera do not this phone is good for battery and screen only nothng more than this
7399,5.0,nice mobile phone
7400,2.0,ordered this in white and the peachy color the armholes were gaping not well designed i dont recommend this tee at all
7401,4.0,i purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks so i purchased the tan jacket i found it to less tan as an olive color not my favorite color for me but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped the jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work recommend pretty true
7402,2.0,i love relaxedfit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string so naturally i was super excited to see these i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag material was soft and flowy but not too thin unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller i barely could get them on and i could not zip up id need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all very disappointed will l
7403,2.0,i noticed a serious problem as soon as i took the device first in my hand it feels like the body of this device from the sidesespecially from the heights is loose or something and it makes some creepy sounds when i hold my device firmly as if the back cover fitting is not proper with the body it also feels like there is a hidden button on the sides as i get tap sound on holding the device if you gently press the back of the device against its screen along its perimeter you can easily see the back filling the gap in between amazon has scheduled an inspection visit for it at my place in the coming days i hope that the technician will understand the issue and i will get a replacement for it asap note not only me but many people are facing the same issue
7404,2.0,i got the phone day before yesterday and after experiencing i am writing review phone is below average beside front camera nothing is good slow not smooth i will not recommend to buy this phone btw i am using gb versionbut it look good slim light weight battery performance is poor charge drain fast star out of
7405,2.0,as soon as i saw this dress i absolutely fell in love with it when i got it i noticed it was slightly small but figured i could deal with it i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back i could fix it but honestly a dress shouldnt start falling apart before you even wear it its cut on the small side wish i tried the larger one but now its sold out and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured i
7406,3.0,i was so excited for this romper but was disappointed after trying it on the material felt cheap for the price and it runs quite small will be returning
7407,5.0,i installed to my office place very nice product
7408,4.0,i tried on a regular size at the store and definitely need petite lbs the dress is comfrotbale and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot where hte muscles meet there is alining so not seethrough length was too long why i need petie also loosefitting i would like it more a little more fitted jsut a bit
7409,5.0,purchased these in both colors today great sale price hei hei is my favorite brand of pants especially their pull on prints i am always a medium these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in each the beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous they have a lovely silky feel to them i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness wont bother me being on
7410,5.0,this is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure woman i have a inch bust and the medium fit perfectlythe whole dress fit perfectly im so glad i took a risk and ordered it i wish it was made from a better material like cotton versus polyester but it has such a nice fit that ill forgive the material choice
7411,2.0,its slow the touch screen is not as reactive as could be
7412,1.0,battery heat up too fast and drains asap laptop is too choppy even my dell gb ram intel i works preety faster everytime laptop shutter even at normal browsing usage
7413,2.0,in paper crown dresses i wear a small or size so for this top i ordered a small it was huge on me for reference im lbs a it is very wide towards the bottom and it flares out way more than in the picture the material is also a little stiff so it really sticks out even if i sized down to the xs i think the bottom would still look unflattering so im returning this
7414,3.0,this is a beautiful lined jacket with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono it hit me at the high hip not low hip as shown on the model given how structured it is i dont think the one size will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit
7415,1.0,the most important function has gone missing the phone latches to network very badly and i can see this for sim and wifi also in same place i change my sim to old sim i can make a call properly in ms its just showing network but no calling possible same for wifi in a corner of my home where wifi strength weak my old phone works like a charm but here it just show connected but not able to use internet very disappointed
7416,5.0,i bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer even though i am normally a smallsize at lbs i opted for the because i am busty d this was the right call the dress is comfortable flattering and i got lots of compliments its a keeper
7417,1.0,i wanted to love this product so badly i ordered it in the mail and it looked beautiful coming out of the box i normally look really nice in grey but this color really washed me out and was not nice on the fabric is very sheer so you would have to wear it over a camisoletank top this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person large in arms small on body odd fit
7418,2.0,buttons were broken off when i opened the package stretchy at waist not good quality for the price
7419,5.0,so nice app
7420,2.0,the brightness of the mobile phone becomes low any time you have to restart the mobile phone every or days there is no fingerprint scanner no flash at the selfie camera if you want flash then there will be a light in the screen itself but when the light comes then you cant view your image which is been taken but you can really view the image after the image is taken there is no earphones with the pakage when i asked the delivery man about the earphones he told that companies dont give earphones to any mobile phone so i had to accept it but after a month i bought another mobile phone of samsung from another shopkeeper there was earphones in it the ringtone is always low and very low but few plus points are also there there are two back cameras which are really well the system is easy to operate i recommend not to use this mobile phone
7421,2.0,gud selfie battery medium design awesome build quality like premium but processor worst worst work full of hanging issue unable to play pupg hd mode not available worst processor tooo slow
7422,5.0,i ordered these culottes because they looked comfortable yet elegant they are indeed both
7423,5.0,better then i like it
7424,5.0,good product bought twice
7425,1.0,bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only my white washcloth turned bright yellow the food came out but surrounding area was super faded so i returned them took the second pair home wore them a few times they stretched out so much washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light these pants are way too much trouble
7426,5.0,since i got my realme u i began a lover of realme brand i have never seen before mobiles at this cost and its truly amazing its mp front camera captures pics like dslr no other mobiles are comparable with realme in my opinion some of the youtubers say that everything is good in realme u but color os is not so good but i think no other os is as cool as color os even the asus brand has the stock android in its mobile but i had seen that it has no style and it has a option in settings thats called smart and convenient its an amazing feature by realme you can pick calls without touching your display you you only have to hold your phone near ear and call will be e connected automatically i think most of the peoples are redmi fan but i would say that try realme phone once and you will fall in love with realme its my challenge
7427,5.0,build quality is so good
7428,2.0,phone is not that expected to need improvement on the device accessories and parts as well
7429,2.0,battery life is pathetic camera quality is poor wasted money for stupid phone i think new lenovo a i should have bought it has
7430,3.0,finget print reader isnt so faster as compatible to this level of phone stand by battery life is so poor
7431,3.0,i really wanted to love this romper and couldnt wait to try it on its super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice but if it sits at my natural waist the back balloons out and its unflattering its too bad i love the print and ease of this design
7432,5.0,mi power bank is very good and it support fast charging battery backup is also good sleek design and its feel smooth when you touch i just really love this product thank you amazon for this product at available at low price its original price is
7433,3.0,im an xl in retailer tops and the xl fit as expected in this blouse however the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse the blouse is a good quality but there were too many other issues for me to keep it
7434,2.0,i really wanted to like this dress but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back will be returning
7435,5.0,its indeed a great value for money i am simply amazed that i didnt think about it earlier smart tv investment is now nullified
7436,4.0,nice product it is worth for this cost rs i cant install any other apps but this tv is good worth
7437,1.0,the cost shows rs discounted price is approx was charged its does not give a look like jblcheap product
7438,1.0,i am not at all happy with this new device its not a good product incoming calls do not display on screen i wish if you can replace with mi note or
7439,2.0,i saw this dress and loved everything about it i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big they were out of the smaller size so i had to return it the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture
7440,2.0,system gets heat up does not get network coverage at most parts internet doesnt work properlyg works slow in this device as respect to already using device realmepro back panel is making noise when held in hand every time when i pick my device there is some noise from back panel seems like backpanel is not fitted properly selfie camera quality is not good rear camera quality is not as per the mp camera sensor provided
7441,1.0,the screen touch is not working
7442,4.0,i was really excited to get this because i hadnt changed my microsd card in my phone since i got the original droid i was so excited to see how much faster the writeread speeds would beit worked great at first but then my phone started to tell me that it was unrecognizable and it kept ejecting it i thought maybe it was a formatting issue so i reformatted it from my phone galaxy s but it just did the same thingafter a week of this i was very irritated and decided to give up and just return it and get another one i was scared that it would do the same thing because many other people had issues with these cards in the galaxysto my surprise the new gb card that amazon sent back to me has been working great where as the other one would have been ejecting every other houri am really happy with amazon and their return policy it was very fast and easy i can honestly say ive never returned something so fast and so easy they literally sent it next day delivery and at no cost to methe only reason i gave it one star off is because i had to return the first one other than that the product has been great so fari am extremely happy with amazons serviceas far as the sd card id definitely get another one if it worked like the one i have now
7443,2.0,first off this runs very large im normally an and sized down to the but probably could have done a it looked like a tent on me the top part is lovely i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now
7444,5.0,i own a couple of these and ive tested them on several devices i use these cards mainly for my mobile devices the gb has performed well on my galaxy note and galaxy note ive tested the transfer rates and they are within the prescribed range these are not the fastest class cards but they are sufficient for storing pictures movies and songs im able to play songs and movies off of the card without any delay at all
7445,2.0,not great quality runs a bit lose disproportionate too large in neck and arms area
7446,1.0,hi
7447,2.0,very poor design now a days
7448,1.0,this laptop is the worst investment for anyone looking to buy a laptop in the k range either i was handed a defective product or the customer service at dell is so amazing that they have never encountered any of the issues i have reported to them and are hearing them for the first time every time i contact them i am forced to spend hours in diagnostics then follow up emails from different customer representatives who are clueless about the concerning problem the onsite support is a myth and the customer care will convince you that the laptop is working fine even after viewing the history of system failures the laptop is a sorry state of affairs when it comes to battery back up less than hours of battery backup while its competition is offering up to hours the ingenious people at dell omit the batteryrelated information in product specification and later throw liion and cell jargons at you to justify their lack of transparency and fraudulent practices its been just under a year and the laptop has shown signs of laptop paint getting peeled off seriously you invest k in a high involvement product and expect this level of poor build quality i expected better from dell the performance is average but it doesnt cover up the fact that the laptop is highly overpriced for its offerings and one can definitely find more value in a macbook air or an hp laptop at the same price point i regret buying this laptop and would definitely recommend skipping this product if you are planning to look for a portable laptop with good battery backup and superior performance i would have loved to give it zero stars if there was an option available for this regret buying this product
7449,4.0,pro mobile does the satisfied with qualities but i not received mobile bill on my mail thats the problem
7450,3.0,i was so excited to find this dress in the store i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty onwhat a disappointment the fabric is stunning but the fit is extremely voluminous i am normally a small to medium so i grabbed a smallthe only way to describe this dress is tentlike it was huge from the waist down i dont think i could size to an xs because i am a d and the top half of the dress fit perfect i was sad to leave the store without this dress
7451,4.0,sound not as expected
7452,4.0,if you use sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring continuously then battery back up would come only days spo option is available after update if you face any issue during update then just enable automatic update through app and connect the band and then leave it for some time
7453,1.0,yikes there is a whole lot of skirt here i am weigh around lb and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing depending on the designer this skirt balloons out from the waist on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking the skirt is very long hitting way below midcalf there is also tons of material creating a parachute effect definitely returning
7454,5.0,excellent product enjoying day by day exploring new features of the product great purchase for white colour look very elegant sound quality is also very good
7455,2.0,this was completely different than i expected the xss was so large that it looked messy unfortunately i had to return it
7456,2.0,i have to reenter all the amazon code and pass as my wi fi is timed for two hours access to prevent unwanted users so this is a big pain and takes much time to relog into amazon alexa for me unfortunately hence ive lost interest in using alexa due to the time it takes to reenter code sad
7457,5.0,awesome camera good picture quality nice blue colour must buy
7458,2.0,it looks like you are wearing cargo shorts really unflattering avoid buying this skirt
7459,2.0,so i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made i really wish this were just lined dress i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath not worth the money but i needed something to wear that was transitional
7460,4.0,good one from xiomi adequete camera quality good battery life up to mark performance nice look
7461,1.0,worst product
7462,3.0,you can not play p resolution videos and it is just an hd displayif you have been using full hd display it might make you fell odd while using make sure you visit mi stores and have a hands on experience and make a decision
7463,2.0,there were no reviews when i purchased this dress from the picture with the model the dress looks to be a straight shift dress i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isnt straight it is also pretty large i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and im not sure i will keep it still on the fence dress is shorter than pictured as well sleeves are shorter than shown now after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture i think the model is holding her a
7464,2.0,this might look good on you if you are very tall and slim i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places the color is not true it is black stripes on gray not cream i thought the stripes might flatter my shape but alas i did not look good in this the material is very nice soft and stretchy
7465,2.0,sound quality was not as expected since bose carries a legacy i was disappointed
7466,1.0,iphone i got is not working properly as soon as i turn it on it shuts down please tell me how can i return this phone

7468,3.0,its okay its not as in depth as the google assistant but i intend to add fire tv to see how that works with the amazon system
7469,5.0,smooth multitasking compared to boring windows battery backup upto to hrs on continuous usage performance good but limitation is only gb memory supports usb transfer it has li cells so battery backup is best gb ram provides the best usage of applications and ms office edition is supported
7470,2.0,the dress is too loose and runs too big
7471,4.0,a nice gentle shampoo that does seem to add volume to my fine hair without irritating my sensitive scalp i wash everday and this neither weighs down or overdrys the shine it gives is superb
7472,1.0,not
7473,1.0,no good
7474,5.0,now used this phone for over a week looks good but plastic finish is out dated onscreen fingerprint sensors not there other wise battery is very good and performance is top notch samsung screen quality has blackest blacks
7475,3.0,not a bed but bettry becup is not gud
7476,3.0,good quality high and clear volumeokaish picture quality
7477,4.0,superb
7478,1.0,so i was silly and bought this product because it smelt nice before reading any reviews i have found it totally unusable as a regular conditioner as it makes my hair very tangled and dry much worse than it is when i dont use conditioner at all its truly awful and something i have never experienced in a conditioner before to avoid rendering this product a total waste of money i have been using it everynowandthen before shampooing on the midlengths of my hair hoping it will provide some nourishment i then shampoo and condition my hair with another conditioner another thing i should note is that the scent does not linger after the hair has been rinsed i will not repurchase
7479,2.0,honestly this product sucks my hair was constantly tangled and dull and my scalp became oily the next day i bought a sample size of another shampoo just to see if the problem was this shampoo and lo and behold my hair became smooth and my scalp less oily right away im never using this again
7480,2.0,i got this conditioner because it came with a rebate so it was like i only paid about for it i dont even think its worth that im giving it lippies because it smells amazing and its supposed to be natural but it is so awful for the hair it dries it out and makes it tangly and almost brittlenot at all soft or smooth in any way and for something that doesnt work i think original price is very expensive for a crappy product for my drugstore all natural brand i will stick with live clean im in canada but my all time favourite would either have to be redken all soft or lacoupe i dont mind paying for something that works but this conditioner didnt do anything for me
7481,1.0,phone is stuck and does not respond to anything i have tried pressing power and volume up at the same time to reset ill get a slight buzz and vibration and stuck in same android one page days replacement also taking too much of time simply wasting time
7482,2.0,there is delaying in making new folder i am trying to solve this problem as i talking to hp laptop but if this problem is not resolved then i will replace
7483,5.0,wonderful
7484,1.0,sound quality is not good do not purshase it
7485,3.0,so many things to love love the mod kind of style the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality but the neckline is just way too deep if they didnt pin the one on the model im a monkeys uncle that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you cant really wear in a church or in front of your dad i seriously considered altering it but the waist is already so high i felt it would ruin the line of the dress
7486,5.0,i wasnt sure how the fabric would be since i ordered it online but i wasnt disappointed its got a lot of movement which makes it really comfortable while still being cute its a little longer than i anticipated but i dont mind that it just gives it a little more versatility also it has pockets i love pockets so maybe im a little biased
7487,3.0,this iphone has problem in video recording once i record it and i play volume goes high and very low in recorded video rest are ok regards rajeev ranjan
7488,5.0,echos are great products i own three different devices in my house
7489,4.0,i havent tried any other headphones except the boat nirvanaand i feel this is a great product in its price range if you want bass n all then u should go for something else other than that its a very good product
7490,1.0,hello i have a gift on samsung mobile but i have not met it yet ever met if you do not visit gift mobile will be returned
7491,4.0,i love this vest it is a great color and the inside is very soft i will definitely be able to dress it up or down if you are in between sizes i would definitely size up if you plan on wearing this with a little heavier turtleneckblouse underneath its amazing i feel so confident in it
7492,2.0,cute enough but i couldnt figure out what to do with the tie that didnt make it look like an extra set of sleeves oddly placed
7493,3.0,if your sole purpose is only to cast your device to your tv then this is not for you as casting your mobile to tv is the worst experience you would get on fire stick rest other streamings are perfect just casting is not proper
7494,4.0,very good product battery life also very good software need to be upgrade as per upgradation
7495,1.0,if i could give this no stars i absolutely would not only because the treatment did not work but because customer service at organix was honestly the worst i have ever experienced and that is truly saying something i followed the directions word for word carefully and using the products they ask to use a hot straightening iron after having to spend close to hours on my hair followed by an awful hours of greasy smelly hair i honestly saw no results i was hoping for anything anything for me to feel like paying was worth it but honestly i should have just thrown my money in the trash can i then followed up with an email to organix to see what they could offer advice insight or a refund but was offered instead the worst customer service ever after sending an initial inquiry email it took two weeks for any response in which they scolded me for not following directions seriously if i didnt follow directions why would i be complaining about an ineffective product when i responded to that email it then took weeks for another response with this quoti apologize but we do not offer a money back guaranteequot no greeting no name no nothing i am hoping to be in touch with a supervisor or manager but after the service i have seen im not expecting it if i could report this company to somewhere i absolutely would any ideas so i guess the bottom line is if you are prepared to waste sore arms and loads of time on this terrible product then be my guest go for it for all those who are still thinking about it i just suggest waiting for an online deal where you can go to a professional hair stylist i just found a deal for and actually see results sincerely out of pocket
7496,2.0,i really wanted to like this but the fit was just off it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too this one was just too much material i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in but decided in the end to return because i just didnt love it the pink color and the fabric are nice though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a
7497,2.0,i wanted this skirt to work it is soft comfortable and cute unfortunately it runs to short i am and would not be able to pull it off at work i ordered a bigger size and it still didnt work
7498,4.0,i bought this phone for my sister as she like samsung phone now samsung has improved in many ways like not much hanging after playing games and no more hitted overall experience is good till now
7499,2.0,wasted of money
7500,2.0,this phone have issues with ios versions it acts weird sometimes i have done a mistake i need it replaced
7501,4.0,nice useful for this mobile
7502,5.0,purchased this for a gift for my motherinlaw older folks are hard to buy things for but she loves this she can play whatever music she wants through her speakers and likes the little extras that you can do with an amazon dot the only drawback with this that im aware of is she has a desk top computer and does not have a smart phone so my husband has the app on his phone so occasionally if her wifi has gone off or something has happened she has trouble getting it back on normally it just comes back on but since she cannot have an app on her phone or the computer she has sometimes it requires his assistance she is and pretty spry just not so savvy when it comes to things like this would i buy it again for her yes i wouldwe also have one of these we put in our shop so we can play music out there through the speakers and it works great
7503,3.0,go for new products of mi i not satisfied with this i expected a lotbut nothing is there
7504,2.0,so sad becuase i like the design i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight i had to take the sweater off and work in a tshirt the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve
7505,3.0,ive had the item months ive always had minor problems it just recently started freezing and rebooting my devices gss currently s sandisk is sending me a new one
7506,1.0,i havent removed card from mobile for few months but one day it suddenly become read only when checked disk attributes in diskpart utility attribute current readonly is set as true dont know how card became read only suddenly when its being used in phone with any exter damage
7507,2.0,phone touch is not properly working while talking timeits automatic light opened and other button pressedlike mute or speaker
7508,3.0,but i didnt like the fit maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off but they werent flattering in any way the color and material were unique and pleasing had to send them back though
7509,4.0,this poor boy mock tneckhigh crew neck top looks a tiny bit more olive to me than the online photos the fit runs on the smaller size and the sleeves will be bracelet length or length for taller women i tried a size xs that was in the store and it fit with the sleeves just above my wrists but a size s would have been fine too im currently narrow shoulders and torsofor reference even the size m of the short sleeve version fit fine so there is a lot of give no
7510,3.0,its built quality didnt satisfy me
7511,3.0,this top is cute but i found issues with both the fit and the quality i tried on an xs but found it to be boxy on my petite frame lbs a even worse though was the feel of this shirt its not lined so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin it was so itchy and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room its a pretty shirt but not worth actually wearing
7512,4.0,amazing product fully satisfied with the product and delivery worth the price
7513,4.0,these jeans fit pretty well on my petite frame although wish they were more cropped for reference i am lbs i was looking for frayed jeans for this fall and these jeans are on trend i may look at petite options which would be truly cropped overall they are very stretchy skinny jeans and have a nice dark wash
7514,4.0,selfi can be taken very clear and nice camera rear camera is also very good smooth function preinstalled apps are super voice quality is clear overall very nice mobile
7515,2.0,everything about this phone is good bt its battery is worst plz dont buy this phone it has a very bad battery backup its battery get from in hours
7516,4.0,as a curvy short gal finding a nice button down that isnt boxy or way too low cut is like finding a gem this shirt is perfect for work and i love how flattering it is my only reservation is that it is more sheer than i would like and so i need a camisole with it i wish this style came in more colors
7517,1.0,never buy a samsung mobile phone this is the second time i have faced this issue oppo vivo products are better than samsung these days its just rd day i had to sell this phone for a loss of camera useless display usless no inbuilt finger print scanner
7518,2.0,given charger look like as old nd cover is also dal
7519,3.0,camera quality is bad
7520,4.0,cute easy to wear dress personally i think it looks better with a belt or something to accentuate the waist otherwise its a lot of fabric in the middle i didnt think the top was too low as others have mentioned though it is possible to wear backwards with a v neck front if that bothered you nice length long enough for work
7521,1.0,very very delicated display worst phone i ever used poor camera quality still there is no software updates
7522,1.0,used it a couple of times and then realized how unnecessary it was to my everyday routine sold it at a garage sale
7523,2.0,i have two of these but my second one has bricked on me it just lights up the lights circulate and they go off then the process starts all over again while none of the buttons work it worked for about a week
7524,1.0,very unflattering and no shape or flair lots of extra material but no swing or shape do not recommend
7525,2.0,the capabilities were not what i expected additionally it has a problem listening to some of the commands i give it thinking about buying perhaps the google product only thing positive is that my daughter enjoys it
7526,5.0,this jumpsuit is amazing i ordered the small and it fits perfectly loose and flowy with room for boobs im a d and hips perfect for humid summers when youd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs in a very flattering way when i have it on i would say that if youre shorter than the petite is the way to go however i am and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model i lifted the leg a
7527,4.0,good deal
7528,3.0,i switched from mi band to mi band all the things are better than before except thngs battery visibility during day time if you are outdoor

7535,4.0,this knit dress is very comfortable i liked the various colors used in the stripes my only issue with it is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short in my opinion this dress with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves would appear more proportional with a longer skirt skirt length along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me regrettably i sent it back

7549,2.0,overall i dont know if i see any improvements to repurchase if you put too much your hair will feel greasy and a bit heavy after you dry your hair make sure to put it in your hair when its still pretty damp to dilute the serum or else its too heavy and just feels thick the coconut smell is way too overpowering im not a huge fan of that type of smell but it does go away after a bit

7551,3.0,when i first started using this product i was in love with it i love the smell and the way my hair felt after a few months of using it i started to feel my hair slowly get damage my ends were starting to break off and just feel like gum if that makes sense i have chemically treated hair and its on the dry side so using this product was not helping but instead damaging my poor hair i wash my hair every other day to every other days so it s not like i was using it too often i gave it lips because the smell is great and the product does last a good amount of time i will probably not finish whats left and just move on to a better shampoo

7556,4.0,this dress is quite lovely but there are a few things to know the blue color is much more of a dark teal with more of a dull green tinge than i expected still pretty but definitely not a pure blue i loved the look of the blue online but i think the pink might have worked a little better with my coloring the dress is a bit low in front not inappropriately low but if you are hoping to be able to adjust by pulling the shoulders back a bit or something be aware that the bodice drapi

7560,3.0,i really want to love this dress the style and colors are so nice and easy i like the loose flowy feel of the dress it runs a tad large but that is part of the style what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress also it has lining which is nice for modesty but with the stiffitchy factor mixed with lining it feels a bit cumbersome i havent decided if i will k

7566,3.0,i am on the fence about this dress the fabric is gorgeous and soft however i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model it was much shorter on me that pictured for reference i am and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight i wanted to love this so much but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be
7567,5.0,corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit welleven with stretch added so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif midrise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great they were long enough as well i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well these are not old lady pants eitherhow nice
7568,2.0,good fast interface but what it lacks is recognising uhd tv because of hdcp requirement which is unnecessary when u can play amazon video netflix from smart tv directly in uhd why should the firestick restrict it because of hdcp port requirementthe whole idea of buying k firestick was to improve the experience
7569,2.0,horrible my hair falls like its autumn season on my scalp
7570,3.0,the colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasnt cut for my body shape i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight updown to have it lay flat as in the model ordered size b tallslim build i also think the hilo hem of the dress isnt well indicated in the pictures im not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric

7572,4.0,got it a little early than accepted going to specs and review first looking at the display at this price point marvelous and unbelievable at this price point going deep in to phone display sound reduced score is for placement of speaker when your in a game or watching a video finger will close it for sure and its a mono speaker thats the main problem battery once in days tried to drain completely but it stayed at even after days camera works good with good lighting and steady hands pixel density is very less and mp is just a word front camera is not that great as well beautifies a little even in default settings check some of the pictures i took with adequate lighting conditions design only problem is with colour accidentally place sapphire blue bit odd colouring if your in a crowd and placement of buttons both volume and power button ok the same side other than that design is great especially the display perfomance great at this price point and good with graphics and speed
7573,4.0,been using it since last months it works like a charm superfast and sleek its very elegant and looks very premium as well the only major issue with this phone is the battery life which after the recent update has almost halved the battery doesnt hold up the juice for even a day and drains superfast

7636,3.0,this is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress the fit at hips and length is perfect falling just to my knee im lbs and grazing my hips in that regard the fit is spectacular but the bodice seems cut very oddly which would require tayloring to correct the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves wings just under the arms that stick out since this dress has a side zip to correct that would seem a major undertaking the stra

7666,3.0,this dress is sort of a mixedmedia dress the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time i like it a lot the bottom is a tight silky twilllike weave the silhouette is straight which is what attracted me to it but when i put it on i realized that the waist wasnt going to work for me the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i

7675,5.0,poli awesome
7676,3.0,wrote cons before because theyre way more important than the little pros of this phone after month usage cons software too buggy its supposed to be maintained by xiaomi but only thing they care about is the ad filled miui with every update they solve minute bugs and create major bugs may update bugged the video recording now its not even able to record videos also may and june update brought extreme stuttering and freezing to the point the phone restarts after servicing im keeping it at march update no headphone jack and youll lose that connecter eventually no memory card slot camera went awry a week back got it serviced battery sucks you can literally watch it tumble while you browse its that bad after months approx hrs of on screen time on light usage absolutely no heavy games pros stock android is light and fluid and really binds the google apps with the ui its practically not cartoonish like most uis sd really complements it i doubt ill ever like any other ui camera is a beast colors are natural with no unnecessary oversaturation done funfact the mp camera is waaaay more superior than the mp sensor in almost all normal conditions even in daylight even though its called low light camera yet only manual mode uses secondary mp lens and manual mode honestly doesnt do much software trickery like in normal mode which betters the shots yet mp is secondary and mp is primary tf build quality is really good metal back glass back as it doesnt break its solid conclusion for k or k its a perfect compromise but for k not worth it

7740,2.0,i purchased this mainly for the scent and i was hoping this wouldnt be as waxy as the regular conditioners it did look to be a little creamier and not as thick and waxy as the regular sea mineral conditioner so i bought it however even using a pea sized amount on the ends of my fine wavy hair made it feel weighed down and gross i paired it with a cleansing shampoo prell and rinsed really well but my hair still felt coated yet it had surface frizz the scent is a beachy sea salt ocean smell it reminds me a little of the old revlon aqumarine which had been discontinued unfortunately this is just way too heavy for my hair it costs around

7745,2.0,well to be honest m disappointed with mi this time and m shocked actually i have used mi devices a lot redmi note note and so on and currently have mi max as well but this tiny phone redmi a is a big let down reasons below the advanced beauty selfie mode with so called ai sucks until its bright sunlight daylight outside so the selfie lovers this is aint a phone or a camera for selfish lovers in low light cabs pub bars etc for selfie lovers heating issue while charging is annoying especially with power bank in traveling in hand or pocket or even bike or car the unlocking screen thing is not smooth i have to swipe up multiple times not sure why or if its a problem with my cheap screen guard tempered glass unless the same dowrks fine with ny other devices inky good thing is the speaker output and the sound just brilliant awsome tiny style with good grip slim look and as a secondary phone or a phone for standard smartphone users and aslo for people with a little high age like people above s will be a great phone battery backup is fine for a day with g and wifi fibuse at home thenese and scustomizations level as usual awesome neteork is fine and called voice quality is good too balcony color is good just that the finger print sensor would have made much more sense most importantly extra memory card slot saves you and also that gb ram is not adequate
7746,3.0,this mobile from most trustful brand samsung i was purchased depends on brand name and it stands for its brand name good quality and worth for money comparing to other mobiles with this is better option
7747,2.0,like other reviewers have said this is very sheer look at the sleeve in the picture and youll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well the material posed challenges for its creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other tight enough that it would have ripped if i werent careful tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life loose billowy and perhaps
7748,1.0,the list shows the price to be but once clicked price moves to kis this an error or a mistake

7756,3.0,okay but not value for money touch is so sensitive that it automatically dials or open apps
7757,3.0,what the hell to pay just for gb apple is kidding or what we r indian not fools to invest a such a huge money to buy just gb instead u can buy wd tb cloud hardisk for only and put that hardisk at any corner of your home and ull be able to access tb hardisk data in ur iphone it can be attached to internet alsoo soo u can access from anywhere nd its having years warranty also so you r no longer of head ach of that it means u can use that even after iphone s and onwards by not investing huge money in those high storage iphone also i am not a wd promoter or else i m just a simple buyer like you but having ca degree so i find every alternte to reduce the costhehehe so dont go for gb or gb it would be appreciated if apple launches gb in the next successor so think twice before investing wheather to go for gbgb or gb in less price i m using s gband wd element tb cloud drive and they are compatible smoothly with each otherthank you abhay moyal
7758,2.0,this conditioner has a great bamboo scent but thats basically the only good thing about it its just not a good product it gives zero slip very little moisture and it leaves a gunky film on hair there is certainly no added quotfullnessquot as it claims i think i would have better results not even using a conditioner after shampooing this one is a miss from organix
7759,3.0,i chose the echo dot over the google home mini as the voice responses from alexa is much more human sounding than from google assistant even though google offers a lot more functionality and better voice recognition this is a good device to introduce yourself to home automation ive kept this device on my bed side table and i use it control my smart lights and a couple of smart switches the sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small form factor however you should not purchase this if your primary use case is listening to music the device is built solidly and has some heft to it the rubber base ensures that the speaker does not vibrate much the ability to create routines is a great convenience the wake word detection works well even from a distance of meters it sometimes fails to register the wake word in the middle of music playback the ability to stream music to an external wireless speaker is convenient although the bluetooth range is about meters in direct line of sight the voice recognition can be improved a lot more music streaming from sources like hungama and gaana are quite buggy and does not often have the music that youre looking for voice recognition often cuts off in the middle of commands alexa finds it necessary to list the names of all the artists in an album before the song which can be very annoying as some tracks have upwards of artists the response from alexa when the wifi is down is quite long and irritating even if brief mode is enabled there should be an option to limit it to just a single tone feedback unless you plan to have home automation this device will get quite boring within a span of few days you can have a much better sounding bluetooth speaker with the added factor of portability for less than half the price comparing with my boat stone
7760,4.0,size down on this top bought it online and when i took out of the packagei quickly put it back in you could have put of me in the xs i think even an xxs would be huge extremely boxy i recommend it only if you can find the correct size

7836,5.0,i have two of these that i am using with a gopro hero and they work great i will be getting more while i could do the gb i so far am preferring the gb because the card is about full right when a battery reaches the end of its life so i can swap a card and battery at the same time and save openingclosing the case and swapping parts all of the time the card is plenty fast never had any hiccups with that and they have proven to be quite reliable as i have a rd card that i have been using in multiple mobile phones htc and bb since and have never had any problem at all with any of them

7840,3.0,i love the look of this dress the fitting could use some workthe top layer could be slightly more fittedbut overall it looks adorable as other reviewers have mentioned the top does not have any button loops my biggest issue with the dress is the quality of the material one time through the wash on the gentle cycle and the slip underneath has shrunk at least a full size for the price of this dress i dont expect disposable clothing if i had known it would shrink i wouldve hand wa

7844,2.0,loved the idea of this unfortunately it disappointed all around its way too short and ran small the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece usually an retailer small lbs dd but ordered a medium small would not have fit in this piece do not recommend
7845,4.0,i ordered this blouse after it went on sale im not typically the blousey type but i thought id try it for me and im a pretty consistent small across brands it was quite flowing and a little long but that may be what someone wants it was a little light in color to look good on me but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans easy to dress up or down
7846,2.0,was very surprised when i opened the package this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all i have a short waist length so it should have worked the color is a little darker than pictured but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced going back asap

7859,4.0,wonderful
7860,2.0,before doing research i assumed this card would support my brand new hero camera considering it was sold off the gopro site it was a no brainer or so i thoughtanyhow the card seems to preform well under most circumstances without using the protunes settings the problems with the hero where due to the slow write speed of this card under protunes settings without this setting the hero works finehowever after a few timelapse issues sec timelapse which is well in this cards speedsi noticed the card is corrupt i tested this in other cameras and found that this problem still persists i trust sandisk as my top choice for all my professional work however this card has failedi would not recommend this expensive card id jump for a samsung or even the transcend cards they even come with a better warranty then this cardnothing but problems and lost memories that i cant replace

7863,3.0,i have pretty mixed feelings about this serum on the one hand i do feel that my hair gets a little stronger after using nothing miraclelike but still noticeable the serum is somewhat thin which i actually appreciate its easy to distribute through my hair but it also runs out of the bottle really easily and you end up with too much product the smells ok not my favorite but not unbearable either a bottle does last forever though i personally just dont see enough of a difference in my hair to repurchase
7864,4.0,great
7865,4.0,love it
7866,1.0,everything was alright the first few months but sometime after the warrant expired months the charger started giving problems it shows to be fully charged when it is not it does not charge changing cable helps sometimes but not always in short it is mostly a miss than a hit in terms of doing its job lousy product i have bad experience with mobiles too so i guess nothing more needs to be said

7868,3.0,phone is good only the seller give less discount as per his mrp on the phone box
7869,1.0,please dont buy it from amazon if you are facing issues which occur occasionally then forget about any assistance from amazon they straight away deny replacement their technician visits to check the phone but doesnt find it because its occasional and didnt occur when he inspected the second time he visited i had a video recorded of the issue which he made note of but didnt update it to amazon hence amazon slipped off from the situation stating they cant help me all this happened within days of purchasing the phone so if u want to buy phones buy it at ur own risk

7887,5.0,i absolutely love this jacket its one of the best things ive bought this season the interior is so unbelievably soft i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin the fit is beautiful as is the pattern its even better in person than in the photo it is pricey but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it its well worth it
7888,4.0,pros astounding battery life packs a massive cell without being bulky or unwieldy great shooting capabilities smooth performance immersive super amoled display cons night mode isnt the best selfie shooter couldve been better no display protection
7889,2.0,i had such high hopes but they are just slightly off they run a tad large so i suggest sizing down i usually wear a or and the fit nicely through the hips and thighs unfortunately the color is off i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray and they have a buttonfly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion i will be returning them
7890,3.0,battery life is not good

7896,1.0,very good phone for the price but what a horrible proximity sensor issue every time you make a call the speaker or flashlight or mute button will be pressed and its annoying

7898,4.0,i am writing this review after using weeks worth to try for the specification battery stays for two days with intermittent use of net videos camera only fault i found in video recording with by default camera recording flash lines are recorded while shooting this problem can be overcome by using different camera app from play store almost gb is used by the defaults app and system
7899,2.0,its very very slow i dont know whether they have delivered a faulty product but it takes sometimes minutes to open a folder or an application i did cleaned up the temp files and stuffs but still no help looks weight all are okay but if it cant serves its actual purpose then what is the use of it i am going to take it to a service center and get it checked anyway
7900,1.0,not nearly as impressive as i was led to think setup is cumbersome and the device itself is not user friendly has quickly become a paperweight and something to collect dust definitely would not recommend for purchase

7902,4.0,product is good charges quickly and data transfer is also good
7903,3.0,the noise cancellation is almost non existent but thats good for me because i want to hear people talking to me anyway theres not much bass unless you use an equalizer to pump it up again i prefer clear sound over bass boosted so not a problem for me overall its a good performance for its price range

7910,2.0,ive never had a problem with pilcro jeans i own several pairs however i ordered my regular size im pounds and not only were these jeans thin they had zero stretch and after hour of wear stretched out horribly they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean
7911,4.0,i bought the phone out of expectation but it turned out to be better than expected like the feature specially the camera and screen size battery life retains till hrs i have not come across any issues yet except the fact that the box did not contain headphones camera quality is outstanding for close subjects and on par with previous iphone series but zooming level is poor overall a great phone at a affordable range of rs satisfactory
7912,5.0,i really love this watch earlier i had got fossil gen smartwatch but had a very unhappy experience with it i mean the battery would hardly last a day compared to that experience this samsung watch has a good enough battery life also i liked the rotatable bezel on the watch initially i was a bit uncomfortable with it but after a day or two i preferred to use the bezel more the build and the look of the watch is elegant overall i have had a satisfactory experience with this watch

7937,1.0,it doesnt do anything seems worthless to me
7938,5.0,i never really paid much attention to hair fallout as it is normal to lose some hairs every day that all changed when i found a bald spot one day while brushing my hair turns out i have an autoimmune disorder called alopecia areata for which i now receive injections directly into the bald spots to coax the follicles into growing hair i started checking out the rest of my hair and discovered some thinning around the hairline kind of like a receding hairline so started a search for hair products that might help and found the ogx fight fallout shampoo and conditioner ive been using it for a couple of months now it doesnt do a thing for the alopecia areata but i wasnt expecting it to however i am noticing some tiny hairs growing along my hairline where the hair appeared to be receding i cant say for sure that these products are causing the regrowth but maybe they are the alopecia treatment is nowhere near the hairline the shampoo is very nice lathers fairly well and has a fresh minty smell which disappears quickly after rinsing the conditioner seems light weight and rinses well in the past i always just conditioned the ends but since the ingredients wont do any good on the ends i am now conditioning right up to the roots especially along the hairline with no greasy effects at all my hair feels soft and full after drying which is a bonus when im worried about the bald spots showing some days i have used a different shampoo and i noticed my hair has less volume overall this is a great shampoo and it probably is helping with the fallout ill keep purchasing

7948,1.0,this top really is lovely i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans i wash everything before i wear it though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned so i hand washed it with delicate soap when the lighter colors came into contact with the black the black immediately stained the light color i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains rinsed and hung it above my bath tub it is cur

7960,2.0,we loved this device when we bought it we use it primarily as a white noise machine in our babys room weve run into problems recently and i have noticed others report he same problems first when we ask it to play ocean sounds by ocean sounds from amazon music it plays a different song than the one weve played for the last several months second the player stops playing even though its set to play on loop this is incredibly frustrating because our baby is more likely to wake up when the white noise stops ive searched the product support information and cant find any solutions to these problems am thinking about returning and just using a run of the mill white noise machine instead

7964,3.0,i agree with the first reviewer this dress is just ok nothing to write home about if you need a throw on dress in a pinch its nice to have on hand but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one it is also very body conscious in the back the material is a thin ribbed rayon on the cheap side overall its a comfortable piece but its more like a thin longsleeve tshirt rather than a quality dress it would have been a gr

7969,5.0,i totally love this author i enjoy his podcasts as well this book helps you get back into an organised lifestyle however this book is more about application of the things written than a one time read and then the book gets decorated up on the shelves its a slow read and one will enjoy its effects if it keeps applying hem to hisher real life
7970,3.0,i have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small im normally a and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted however it is so very thin and see through i was looking forward to a cool cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it it came with no slip at all so th

7973,4.0,overall i like this sweater but it does have a couple flaws the sweater looks better snapped unfortunately it only has one snap on the frontthere should be another one inside after a couple wears my snap started to come loose probably because it pulls so much the sweater is a bit oversized and i probably ordered the wrong size im and lbs i ordered a medium should have ordered a small all that being said i still love the look and color moss green of the sweater and would

7979,5.0,ive owned a number of pilcro denim jackets it in my day not because theyve ever needed to be replaced but because im obsessed with the fit the color and the style when i saw this one i knew it would be no exception this jacket is even cooler looking in person the fade on the denim is totally perfect not too dark not too lightand not so distressed that it looks sloppy the denim is soft just like all other pilcro and the fit is a dream what i love the most is the interest in the c

7985,4.0,the weight and feel of this jacket is what i was hoping for it is medium weight making it my go to on cool days and is also very flattering to wearit actually gives you shape i like the front texturing on the scroll work and the pockets are well placed if anything could be different i would have preferred a little more room in the sleeves as they run slightly snug so not made to wear with anything with bulk but overall not an issue
7986,2.0,pros display quite smooth and pleasing dont think about polycarbonate body build is good batery backup as compare to k is ok corns dont get puzzled by youtube review camera is just ok as it include ai pixel is not clear but for social media it will do the job design i think samsung followed the trend and other brand my first notch display phone thought its gonna be ok but trust me it looks really odd speaker sound quality not good not a bit loud just a cheap sound like low budget phone main thing where it comes to pubg you wont enjoy the gaming with the frame drop in balanced mode with medium frame rate lag is effective lol the design is poor they have kept the speakar gaap in the bottom side so u will face interruption while gaming the grip wont go easy as it have headphone jack also in the bottom left which will definitely make u feel odd while gaming in loudspeaker or headphone even after days of use it has started to lag in basicnormal graphics with medium fram rate i am a samsung lover where as i wont recommend you to waste money on this brand they dont deserve the frame anymore only thing i have now is regret after purchase m

8000,3.0,for reference athleticmuscular body type broad shoulders slim hips im a bit confused on the sizing for this especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up i ordered the xs and i was swimming in it i usually am quite comfortable in size small so im not sure why the xs was still too big perhaps you need hips for this dress to work because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all im not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi

8003,3.0,i was on the fence about this dress because even on the model its a little bit frumpy but it was so pretty that i tried it however on my short frame its even frumpier the quality is very good the fabric is soft and its lined the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin i am lbs with largeish hips and i ordered a p but even the petite was too saggy i needed a

8023,3.0,i love this swimsuit the color the pattern and the coverage the material is different for me but easy to get on and off my complaint is that although the backside looks great there is no padding in the front for a full coverage suit this leaves little to the imagination im torn on finding justification to keep it

8036,4.0,this skirt was placed next to the gallery skirt corduroy skirt and i thought it was the same until i touched the fabric and realized it was denim the material is not the average stiff jean type but much thinner cotton material i am surprised that this skirt is now released because i feel that it should have belonged to the summer collection i think it is a nice basic casual skirt if you need one kudos for the unique buttons the first button is decorative which stands out from the rest of

8046,1.0,i have longer than shoulder lengh naturally dark brown hair thick and is wavy but tamable it has been highlighted and lowlighted for the past years whenever i get bored so i need moisture for my hair the first time i used this product it did not do anything regarding straightening abilities and did not smooth it out i used it a few more times and alternated conditioners and this one left the least amount of moisture none if anything i know it is sulfatefree but i use aveda leave in which is also sulfate free and it does an amazing job leaving my hair smooth i was looking for an alternative leave in as the aformentioned one costs ml i decided to write a review because yesterday after i used the organix product it left my hair knotty unmanagable rough and i used pumps of moroccan oil and it still felt rough my hair was clumping and i was scared to wash it today despite that i used an old bottle of loreal mask which i know has a lot of sulfates and it feels amazing at this moment this conditioner smells amazing but does nothing for moisture or straightening my hair i would get the same result if i did not use the conditioner i know it is not because it is sulfate free because the aveda one does wonders but crazy expensive i will keep on looking

8052,3.0,i brought it for my mother when she complained about low storage in her phone thankfully that complain is no where however i think there was no need to attach the adapter to the product as i already had one san disk is a trusted brand and i have been using it for years therefore bought it without a second thought i guess the price for the product is a bit on higher side the product is quite durable as i said i have been using the same storage capacity is satisfactory overall good product

8058,3.0,phone is perfectcharging time is high
8059,5.0,i saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fallwinter maxi in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better
8060,4.0,love the unique stitching on the shirt and the dye job i think it does run a little big the arm holes are quite deep even in a medium but the fabric is thin so a tank underneath would probably work out well
8061,1.0,i brought that mobile in amazon as on feb and i have started to use the mobile after a week i received when i switched on the mobile i saw few black dot on the screen and i thought its normal now the display was completely black and was able to hear only the ring tone and the screen does not wake up so took the mobil to service center and got to know from you about the issue my mobile is already opened for service and its water log i dont know how a new mobile is out of warranty and serviceits terrible when amazon is not able to help me on this we believe online marketing is very good in service but useless if i have brought this mobil in some retailers shop at least he will understand the issue now im helpless and i have to loose my rs its lesson for me and people who read this pls dont believe online purchases

8067,4.0,i love this top the color is quite unique a reddish color but the cut really makes it stand out i love the square neckline i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph however in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch for me this was not an issue as the top suited my body type well rega
8068,3.0,i can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me perhaps it is too flowy because i am or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me i did size down as reviewers suggested maybe one size was not enough i must return it
8069,3.0,average sound quality
8070,4.0,i really like this shirt the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt its a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater
8071,5.0,i bought this in the sky color and sized down from my normal medium and absolutely love it i dont think its boxy at all on the contrary i love the way it hangs i dont find it to be short either though i do tend to layer with a longer cami underneath ps the ruffle detail is precious
8072,1.0,tv not turn on with in monthsno customer support

8075,5.0,saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store i usually wear an or a depending on how things run im a dd so i tried on both sizes i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get the was just a tad looser so i went with that one but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference it is a very figure flattering top and a plus that you can machine wash it simply awesome
8076,2.0,i am and the arms of this sweater run at least inches past my finger tips if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall it just doesnt work also i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online sigh

8079,3.0,really wanted to love this top but it was too boxy for me really pretty deep wine colors and a great plaid but overall it did not give me any shape and it was returned
8080,1.0,horrible service from amazon this is like we pay and we are stuck with you guys the phone is a waste of money the battery drains out very fast and phone gets heated up very quickly we cant return the phone cause it says replacement is there but how is it that we cant return the product as we are unhappy
8081,3.0,they are beautiful in person until you put the on the fit was a bit weird tighter in the waist roomy in the crotch the fabrics work against one another the vegan leather especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams is too stiff the back is thin and has far too much elasticity at i passed these will only enter my closet on sale
8082,3.0,the model makes this dress look amazing but it didnt translate that way on me the print is really beautiful i loved that but the waist is huge and the skirt part is aline and full not streamlined like it looks on the model if it was more like that this dress would be a hit but sadly its a miss this is something your mom would love on you but few others
8083,4.0,very comfortable and cute i had fallen in love with this in the catalog and when i saw it in the store i was disappointed however after trying it on i had to have it very flattering and comfortable
8084,4.0,this dress does fit small i am generally a size in maeve but purchased this in a i have a large chest g which contributed to my need to size up the green color is beautiful and the dress looks darling on i have a little trouble with the zipper but nothing that required me to return the dress my biggest complaint is that the straps are a tiny bit too long and dont lie flat on my shoulders other than that i receive a ton of compliments every time i wear it
8085,2.0,extremely limited uses and plugins require sometimes word long commands that need to be recited exactly a one word alteration ends in a sorry i dont understand
8086,3.0,neat little gadget does a lot of everyday tasks easily stars removed because there is not a decent ownersuser manual to explain setup options and other necessary functions fumbling through pages of a nonhelpful website is lousy customer service but it is a very useful household electronic device

8094,1.0,the product didnt work plugged in a usb thumb drive but my macbook pro didnt recognize however with the mivi adapter it works without issue so i returned the item
8095,4.0,if its cons doesnt affect you then go for it but consider all its cons before purchasing overall nice product the experience of using stock android on mi phone feels good cons average battery life mm jack not available camera is raised so much raised above from the surface proximity sensor not working good auto brightness problem comes with standard charger though it supports quick charging except all this cons it have many pros

8103,1.0,i wanted to love this sweater but it is a return it is a very weird fit very thick ruglike material and unfitted the shoulders are bulky the top is big and the booty is small i am c and typically wear a small the arms were very long way too long i will say other than that the top was true to size may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum
8104,1.0,do not buy worst camera quality i have seen in recent timesimages look completely fake years before samsung had better camera in this range phones screen is patheticlooks all artificial colour enhancement all the ratings provided here are bogus and probably paid i believed the ratings and purchased this crap my return to samsung was dissapointing unfortunately cant return phones hence i am forced to use it after some time will exchange

8108,2.0,most of the time alexa cannot answer our requests or has no idea what we are saying other times she turns on randomly or the music will stop playing in the middle of a song pretty frustrating dealing with this device
8109,3.0,so this is a super soft comfy sweater the color is great and i really wanted to love it but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me that being said all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it the neckline is also really neat it drapes nicely and stays that way if you are on the fence give it a try
8110,2.0,length of its both wires are frustrated as too lengthy and not comfortable at all when you fix the buds in ears not hearing any outside sounds clearly also hurting eqrs other than above battery capacity and bluetooth range built quality r good

8128,3.0,this is a very lightweight comfy sweater jacket i wanted to love but didnt find it special enough for the price i am usually between a small and medium and tried on both sizes in the gray and the navy the small fit snug in the shoulder but i liked how the layering showed at the bottom of the front that look was lost on the medium though the general fit was better in the end the looked medium too sloppy for my taste and the small felt too small

8135,2.0,i was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all colors when i saw this new one i was thrilled and ordered it immediately what a disappointment why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing the fabric is a very loose weave sort of homespun look which wouldnt be a deal breaker but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags last years styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move this version is fully lined yo

8143,5.0,saw this in the store yesterday and had my daughter try it on it was really cute on her and she loved it in fairness to the other reviewers she tried on a size which was perfect for her petite frame and i can see how this blouse would run really big in the larger sizes but the fabric and detail is so pretty and it was on sale
8144,2.0,this is a solid lippie shampoo it didnt make my hair feel particularly volumized or nourished rather sometimes it made my hair so tangled that i was forced to use conditioner when i usually only use conditioner about times a week on the less negative side it didnt dry out my hair strip it of its moisture or add buildup i did enjoy the smell and the cute bottle but ive got lush shampoos to fulfill that first requirement and the cuteness of the bottle doesnt really have much to do with the condition of my hair i did use up my bottle but i wont be buying it again
8145,5.0,this dress is beautiful the pictures do not do it justice i love the fabric and overall feel of the dress light and airy i have very broad shoulders and i did not feel like it look good on me so i am sending it back too bad for me i think the dress is perfect for weddings parties and even everyday wear

8149,3.0,fhd is not provided due to which phone is not providing good clarity while watching videos it is not the phone for movies watchers
8150,2.0,camra not good
8151,1.0,the phone is the most flopped model of redmi i exchanged redmi note pro for this phone and this phone ia total disaster pros looks sleek and stylish like iphone easy to hold display size and design cons the gb ram phone is dead slow when we toggle between apps gaming experience is terrible the screen freezes most of the time the fingerprint unlock takes quiet some time to unlock the phone camera clarity is of very bad quality watching movie for hours will drain the battery completely the phone can be of good review with the senior citizens as they will not buguse the phone much
8152,5.0,i cant believe i waited so long to get this it is truly soft and well fitted the deails in the sleeves and neck are just great kuddos again angel of the north
8153,2.0,my echo dot has never been loud enough not sure if i got a defective one or not but the speakers dont work around the whole base of the dot only on one side i didnt expect it to be as loud as my echo but its not even louder than my phone i do not recommend buying the dot save your money and get the echo its waaayy louder and better in my opinion
8154,2.0,i bought this based off of all the glowing reviews here on mua and i was not disappointed i had previously been using loreals evercreme shampoo and conditioner but i was starting to notice how flat my hair was because the shampoo wasnt getting rid of any product build up in my hair i dye my hair w permanent color at home every month and recently had an episode that necessitated the use of coloroops darn you feria you turned on me so i think because my hair was extra dry and sad from the abuse evercreme did offer some muchneeded moisture but soon as my hair got back to normal thats when i saw issues with it i did a lot of research here on mua and this was one of the few drugstore brands that was sulfate free and got high marks for cleansing and repair i bought both the shampoo and conditioner at walgreens bogo free pretty sweet deal for an shampoo amp conditioner love the scent mild and pretty and love how the shampoo lathers so well i think even though its sulfate free it lathers enough to cleanse properly the conditioner doesnt seem like its going to do much for your hair because of its light whipped texture but it does a fantastic job my hair looks so fab and shiny and smells great never been so satisfied with a drugstore shampoo and conditioner i love being able to find products i can buy again and again nothing worse than buying an quotokquot product and having to start from square one researching what might work better before you can even go to the store and complete your shopping list update started to dry my hair out after the honeymoon period was over
8155,5.0,awesome phone this is the reasons why samsung charge premium for their phones as soon as you turn on this phone you are welcomed to a premium world called samsung the one ui is the best skin on android i would rate the ui experience on par with oxygen os if not better the samsung super amoled display on ms is the best display you can find on any phone upto a range of k i will not compare how would exonys with sd or but i can say that the performance is very fluid i am using it from last days and i have not noticed a single lagi am playing call of duty on this beast and it played very well without lag in medium graphicscamera experience was also good as it takes decent pictures from both front and back in good lighting condition and struggle during night if you are choosing just for camera you may need to consider other options as camera is not its strength however its not bad either i would rate the camera to be above average overall and excellent during daytime battery although its mah it performed like mah dont get me wrong the battery performance was not bad it easily lasted for and days with medium usage with screen on time to be to hrsbut inward expecting days of battery life build is below average with a very cheap quality plastic used and there is a ceeaking nice when you press from side but i would ignore this as we normally dont press phone during day to day life to conclude i would say this is best smartphone under k k during offer and redmi realme be aware samsung is back
8156,5.0,great phone bought it for my sister sound and the battery life very good she is lovin it
8157,3.0,i bought this card to replace a lost gig in my phone htc g seems to be working perfectly so i will recommend to all wait read oni had this card in my phone for a little over a month when it messed up the phone stop recognizing the card tried it in the computer and it was not recognized either i contacted sandisk and they did send me out a replacement but i lost the few pictures i had on the original card i could have sent the card to sandisks data recovery people and they would have charged me if they were able to recover the data and nothing if they couldnt a bit to rich for me so i passed and unfortunately lost the photos
8158,3.0,i love how this dress is photographed but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on this one is going back
8159,1.0,not good
8160,1.0,brought this as my first samsung smartphone worst product ever used as compared to other brands cant install apps from play store as it shows download pending without installing any apps it used gb out of my gb also some of the rarely used apps cant be uninstalled i want to return this product but dont have such option the appearance may look good but due to technical faults i would like to rate it
8161,3.0,the sweater is very very warm it looks okay not the best but not bad i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure i dont wear sweaters and jackets without closures i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder so i am sending it back
8162,4.0,great featureperfect lacingdo not need to worry that it is too low since there is material behind the bottom of the lacing like length sleeve gives top the right proportion
8163,2.0,first let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress but the fit is extremely loose they could take out an entire inches of material and it would still be a swing dress the photo of the back of the model where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate if it was i would love this dress the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline i am
8164,5.0,i bought it one week agoi was bit unsure about it but now i do not regret my decision phone looks premium battery awesome fingerprint reader very responsive camera quality is good as well

8168,2.0,love the look of this and the fabric but runs way small i usually wear a ordered the then just got the and its still too small will be returning all
8169,3.0,this romper is cute i wont deny that however the rayon fabric made me really feel like i was wearing pajamas i was afraid it would wrinkle horribly however the real problem with this romper is how hard it is to get on and off your shoulders im short but have a little wider shoulders so perhaps that was the issue it seems like another reviewer had the same problem there are only two snaps from the waist up and nothing to open it further from the waist down so i had to do some cont
8170,5.0,i used this to take pictures it works good i think it works just as good as any other memory card i have ever used

8175,1.0,worst performance not at all satisfied with the processing speed lagging at all functions google play doesnt download any apps dont know whats the issue with phone
8176,2.0,page quality is bad
8177,4.0,i love this top its loose and flowy yet flattering and the colors are fun the armholes are cut a little low so a cami is necessary after one wash and lay flat dry the wrinkling is substantial hope i can steam it back to its normal shape
8178,1.0,after week stop one side not working
8179,3.0,i dont think i am using it right but every time i ask a question like i would with seri the dot says i dont knowi cant get questions answered with the appthe dot says go to the app and the app does not have the category
8180,5.0,a very good phone you can update to ios its fast im not an audiophile so the apple headphones are good enough for me the adapter works well when i tried with my senheiser headphone in my car i just plug the usb cable and it works i could control like select playlist change track form my inbuilt car stereo picture quality is awesome i like that i can shoot raw battery last the whole day
8181,5.0,i walked into retailer with low hopes of finding a dress for a friends spring wedding as a lot of this seasons dresses are more casual but was drawn to this pretty number for multiple reasons it can certainly be dressed up or down depending upon accessories the fabric feels incredible it has pockets and its really fun yet classy as heck typically i wear a m in dresses but they only had a in store so i took it and made it work by tightening the sash a bit extra and wearing a bra w
8182,3.0,looks wise it is good but quality is not much
8183,4.0,wonderful phone good performance
8184,3.0,good not bad
8185,3.0,i have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving the fit for me however is totally wrong for reference im dd lbs and am a s or the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms the arm length was more of a sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy the quality felt like it was lacking too the material felt like it would pill easily order with caution
8186,3.0,i ordered this sweater in green and it was a lovely soft color the style of the sweater was nice really deep side splits made it feel trendy the sweater is a great length nice fabric and the side splits are appealing however it was just so so big that i couldnt pull it off i just swam in it i am and lbs fairly wiryeven the xs didnt work for me perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman i even considered having it tailored since ive had a hard time find

8188,3.0,cheap quality product and price
8189,5.0,this shirt is really lovely the fabric is soft and comfortable and the embroidery is very well done it looks great with jeans and adds a little feminine touch to the look
8190,2.0,ordered this product since it is a nylon braided which run longer than the normal one however it did not last more than month time note with normal home usage and no external wear n tear
8191,5.0,it has been over week and i am enjoying this kindle only thing troubled me is its touch which skips few pages instead of one in a single tap dont know if it is a glitch in mine
8192,3.0,i really wanted to love this top love the mix of fabrics and patterns but it is too short for a tunic length i should have paid attention to other reviews im about and was not too tight in the bust and shouldersi have to return because the length isnt right
8193,1.0,refurbished product
8194,4.0,i received this in the mail a few days ago and was so pleased with it except that it was huge i am normally a in most things so i ordered a large i was swimming in it in all areas shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i dont look larger than i am i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking
8195,2.0,warranty card missing hai this is not fair please provide warranty card of year as mentioned

8197,1.0,seemingly a useless device horrible sound quality not portable no bluetooth unless connected to the internet and the wall i have had this device for weeks and am still looking for a single practical use
8198,3.0,the phone conks off dont think the os can take load been just months and its already acting up not sure if the problem is with the device or orders from amazon
8199,5.0,thank you to amazon for a prompt delivery and phone really looks great as premium phone from the usage of two days it feels very good
8200,1.0,i have to unnecessarily visit the apple service center multiple times because i have been delivered a faulty product
8201,1.0,the phone has good look thats all cam is pathetic if not more in this era of cam phones lagging by miles the charger is a c type but not a fast charger by any means the finger print reader is far too up n u have to really reach for it face recognition is far from okay also phone hangs a bit though only for k but doesnt really justify it a starer overall after months of use star cant even compare to vivo n oppo in same range money wastage totally now not even worth one
8202,1.0,its waste of moneyits price shud be maxfrom camera to performance its wasteboth sims are not gas writtencheap crapand keeps hanging blinks and sometimes behaves weird auto close open and switching screen and appswalls are yellow and pics are fainted yellowworst cameranone of two bastards who were supposed to come for inspection did cameand i see service check completed as wellgood job amazon buy an mind faulty phone and no returns replacementjust test dry with blanco first he was supposed to cine and then he gave other guys number just we will come and all and no one did comeauto hanging auto working despite reset poor phone in this price and considering todays marketselling old hardware in new boxgood job mi with amazon

8204,1.0,a serious joke i struggled with the buttons for a good minutes and gave up after the rd button im not sure what they were thinking
8205,5.0,good service in mobile product quality price in best quality
8206,4.0,i agree with the other reviewer the photos do not do this shirt justice its very cute and fits well the photos on the models are terrible im tall lbs and d and the size medium fit me perfectly im often in between a m and l for cloth and stone but the medium fit well which means it runs a little big i wanted a plain white shirt with a little interest and the side buttons add that it also means this is not a tuck in shirt but more of a tunic
8207,4.0,one who wants to buy a budget phone and wants to also get the latest android updates and experience it well the mi a is here to deliver important things for me will be camera the rearfront works well and captures brilliantlyselfie is mind blowing i mean the portrait works like a breeze in selfie mode as well as the rear camera also it has different modes and filters for the ones looking to be creative and try some changes as and how your mood demands the phones build quality is beautiful and also the phone is fast in terms of multi apps being used eg in shorts whatsapp facebook microsft excel google pay chrome it works well the charge is also pretty good and depends a lot on every individual ones using the mobile internet rather than the wifi will see that the battery drains quickly but not as quickly as with motorola g plus so i would say it does its job decently well i wouldnt say cons as the phone itself is a winner so cant crib this isnt there that isnt there just go for it cause the price is just perfect
8208,1.0,i bought the echo dot so i could use alexa with my firestick couldnt get it to work sent it back
8209,2.0,when i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print i was so disappointed when it came the print is not centered in the front or the back it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry for this price the detail of centering the design was expected especially because this is how it appeared in the picture loved the blouse but i will be returning it becau
8210,4.0,i am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews well its still huge i have about inches that i can take in from the side i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering i love the colors and design but as it is it does not do anything for me for reference i am lbs d
8211,3.0,i gave it a because it isnt thaaat mediocre like most organix products the scent is okay i like it the consistency is thick but the results are meh i think you could find something better out there i mean it does add some moisture to your hair but it wont go far no matter how much you leave it on for and i have noticed that organix conditioners makeyour hair look more voluminous yet not very soft to the touch and you can see a film on it
8212,5.0,this skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than im used to in my closet but thats not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing it runs a little large in the waist also the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh however i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come
8213,1.0,loved how this draped and im super petite b bust and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned i purchased the pxs and it was huge i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest too sad retailer please get the fit right
8214,2.0,i hate chinese goods
8215,3.0,its a fiction first of all it not as good as expected in my opinion its a teenagers book very loosely based on alchemy alchemy is one of the most reckoned powers in occultthe book only describes the philosophers stone and the elixir none of which are of significant importance to a real alchemist
8216,1.0,laptop is not turning on please call back asap
8217,2.0,it hangs when we open google maps and music one after other two or more application running slows down the phone performance and battery is bad after two months usage
8218,2.0,after one months of use one horizontal black line come on the screen now my tv at lg workshop from of step very bad experience
8219,4.0,this top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if youre an outgoing person especially for a summer evening my only confusion is the too high neckline if it was just a little lower it would look and feel less chokey i keep wanting to pull it down im a size and needed the xxs which fits like most peoples xss as sizing continues to get bigger really lovely except for the neckline looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas
8220,2.0,like others i finally received my size p black pants after months of waiting for starters these pants run small so i ordered a size up but still in petite because i adored the red ones i got this past summer when the black pants arrived they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones which were also p and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality im debating ordering the regular length but im not sure ill bother based on some of the other reviews
8221,2.0,camera is not good if you zoom totally you can see

8227,1.0,delivered package is damaged when opened
8228,1.0,i was very disappointed with my recent retailer order i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition very disappointing
8229,3.0,i personally found it a little boring
8230,4.0,i bought this to expand the limited memory of my dell venue pro i use it to store mp videos and mp music and streamingplaying both work very well even the description explicitly says reformat into file system other than exfat may cause instability id hope to use it to remap my onedrive fka skydrive folder which requires it being reformatted to ntfs the warning is correctbetween windows the tablet and the sandisk microsdxc the os became unstable once id reformatted and changed onedrives location to it i rebooted windows and windows could not detect the card i reformatted the card back to exfat and it works as expected
8231,4.0,im still learning about all of its features
8232,3.0,i think the echo dot should have been preloaded with more apps
8233,4.0,good book with all the tips to improve ur mindset
8234,3.0,average only for picture quality at angles colour looks similar a soill say its pricey jio tv cannot be installed
8235,5.0,camera is best for the given price
8236,2.0,this skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing ive ever ordered from retailer it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all there are also weird stitching lines one more thing that i didnt like about the skirt was that its a creamish color not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt its going back
8237,1.0,every mobile should be check before packing but the mobile which i bought all ready in service center due to mother board issue then what they are checking
8238,2.0,i ordered this and thought it would be cute for work but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long i am foot and do not have short arms also it is a bit short waisted for me i do love the floral detail of the button
8239,2.0,it will not work unless it is plugged in i bought this so i could take it where i go around the house and on the patio i do not have outlets on my patio therefore i cannot use it
8240,2.0,i wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try the dress turned out to be too loose i got size after checking the measurements chart im lb and usually wear s i could practically wrap myself in this dress besides it looks a bit too long well im not as tall as the model in the photos and i dont like wearing high heels the material looks faded not as bright as in the pictures i like distressed and vintage style but this
8241,1.0,product has been delivered as per schedule as per the storage capacity given but the problem was the writing speed it was too slow mbps and after which it is getting slow and it is showing to minutes and it stops in between there is some writing speed issue on this sd card

8244,4.0,first i think this dress runs a bit large i am and about athletic build i tried on a l m s and ended up keeping the small it is also a bit longer than id like hits me in the midknee in the back hem and barely above my knee on the front hem not midthigh like on the tall model i probably would have preferred a petite size but they were sold out anyhow i decided to keep this dress because it is super comfortable but still stylish enough to wear to work the slightly fitted a
8245,2.0,its okbut the big issue is screen quality its not at all upto the mark and doesnt give immersive experience
8246,5.0,best phone premium smartphone
8247,3.0,this was really billowy but not in a good way i had to return it looks great in the photo but not so much in person
8248,3.0,the bass output overdo the vocals the headphones doesnt stand by jbl reputation i was expecting better quality sound with good bass and treble balance but sad it wasnt there good for calling purpose overall the headphones are good for light music lovers
8249,3.0,another shirt i really wanted to love i adore green but so few tops are made in this color please make more however this shirt didnt work for me i think its a matter of where your curves live the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on probably a great shirt for different body types would love to see more green clothing
8250,5.0,i really surprised to see camera quality very good product very fast autofocus stunning image quality i am really very happy to purchase from amazoni have print image size ft ft its really detailed image thanks nikon thanks amazon
8251,3.0,doubt about new product
8252,2.0,phone keeps heating up due to which i get headace
8253,1.0,so wanted great pair of sweater leggingsgreat for running errands and keeping the outfit simple these are not that these fit very poorlyi ordered the small which is more like a large one in the waistlinethere is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them unfortunately i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times
8254,4.0,love it in the amount i paid grabbed in the deal for rs n total value for money the watch and tracker works fine and syncs well with app without issues the tracking is almost accurate the only issue i faced is getting a new strap which we hardly get as soft as original otherwise a great buy
8255,5.0,no need to say anything about this book excellent we get positive energy
8256,4.0,im happy with the product and its performance so far i bought it on oct the only thing that concerns me is that i need to carry a separate charger for charging the power bank as am using ctype charger for my phone also its taking a lot of time to charge the power bank but i guess its common for k mah power banks
8257,1.0,back camera has very low performance image processing is very bad in this phone i think it is default y product i want return
8258,5.0,i really dont have much to say about sandisks cards they work as intended i never had a problem with them
8259,4.0,this cover up is precious i ordered both sizes because i was unsure of how either would fit since there was only a sm and ml there is not a whole lot of variation between the two i wear a size pants and the sm fit but i may still keep the ml instead for fear that it may shrink when washed the garment is hand wash only which i will do because of the delicacy of the tassels thats a little high maintenance for a cover up but i am willing to do it because it really is a cute cover up
8260,1.0,very bad picture quality
8261,2.0,does not work well we live in the country slow internet service
8262,5.0,love this top you can really fess up i ordered in a small i am and pounds

8264,4.0,i loved this dress immediately i got the blue and orange and love the combination of the top fabric and the flowy skirt only one complaint its a bit short on one side so ill have to wait for cooler weather to wear it with tights if i want to wear it to work
8265,1.0,i purchased two of them now both stopped working one of them stopped charging after day still havent got replacement and the other one stop working after th day it looks durable but its quality is worst than rs cable bought from local store
8266,5.0,ive used this to charge my camera batteries canon gopro and panasonic and my iphone x for over a month initially i was worried that the higher output port may damage my phone battery and reduce battery life but i dont see any effect on battery in months of usage it can charge my phone mah around five times which means it retains of its rated mah capacity which is great also doublepressing the power button to enter low current mode is good for charging wireless earphones and other lowcurrent accessories without damaging them with high current the product is also durable ive dropped it twice but there were no functional repercussions or damage to its physical form to conclude i was always skeptical about chinese brand power banks and was initially biased to brands like anker and lenovo but this mi powerbank gives similar performance or better at a much lower price point highly recommended
8267,5.0,worth
8268,4.0,product was asomereally superb
8269,1.0,not charging within days
8270,4.0,great pants with a couple of quibbles these pants have mini blue stripes in the fabric so in real life they look a bit more blue than they do in the photos these are not white pants but they would fill the faded blue denim niche in your wardrobe and also like faded blue denim these pants are more opaque than most lightweight white pants are these days you would not want to wear black underwear with these but likewise your undergarment choice would not be immediately apparent compa
8271,3.0,oily roots dry ends and damaged hair this shampoo didnt do any good i use it daily and leaves my hair in a frizzy decent state was expecting much more for the price if you have my type of hair check the catwalk moisturize oatmeal and honey my hair was really soft back then when i used that stuff
8272,4.0,bought this sweater on sale off the website it fits perfectly nice length as some others said a little scratchy at the neck but certainly tolerable just need to wear a cami or tee underneath the collar is a nice shape fabric is a little stiffer than it looks in the photos
8273,5.0,very nice product strong built adequate base and sound for a small room
8274,1.0,the product received in the defective condition the tv stops working after min when we called serivce center they told us to contact amazon and ask for return but there is no such option on amazon
8275,5.0,smart features picture quality really good
8276,2.0,the design is very flattering and holiday appropriate but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used although figure flattering the zipper is so cheap that it runs along the left side it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress and the rough cheap poly is not worth what theyre asking for it maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail
8277,2.0,battery problem
8278,1.0,costly product but software issue service center not available in chandigarh region overall wastage of money

8285,3.0,many other things are ok but i cannot here other persons voice on call
8286,2.0,tried the organix brand bc i have been experimenting with sls free hair care and this is available at cvs really love this scent and am pretty happy with the shampoo but man this conditioner is pretty terrible my hair is pretty agreeable and this conditioner dried it out and just did not do its job
8287,3.0,i wanted to love this top it was huge and i didnt like the material it felt like it should have been much less expensive than it was
8288,2.0,great device terrible support device starting having problems updating firmware amazon solution buy a new one
8289,3.0,this shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small i normally wear between a to a or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose
8290,3.0,the pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice there is just too much fabric its much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress ill be returning it

8295,2.0,i am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store i wanted to wear them every day received lots of compliments felt that you could dress up or down etc this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing on the second wear i noticed threads coming out on the seams but just on one side of one leg this was irr
8296,1.0,not worthprocessor is very slow would not recommend to buy to any one
8297,4.0,pros strong performance for the price classy build quality pure android cons screen brightness low and adaptive setting way off no nfc or headphone jack limited availability key features inch x ips lcd screen snapdragon octacore ghz gb ram gb of storage mp mp dual rear cameras mp front camera mah battery fingerprint sensor verdict the xiaomi mi a is a phone that punches way above its weight a few hardware shortfalls and limited availability drop it just short of an automatic recommendation but this is deeply impressive stuff from xiaomi why buy the xiaomi mi a beyond performance this is a wellbuilt stylish in a slightly derivative way phone with a highly competent camera the inclusion of stock android oreo really completes that premium feel and puts the mi a beyond many of its affordable chinese rivals a couple of drawbacks prevent it from being an unequivocal recommendation however the mi as screen doesnt get bright enough and the lack of both nfc and a headphone jack are tough to swallow ultimately though the biggest downside to the xiaomi mi a is that it isnt more widely available at the time of writing if xiaomi can really commit to a global launch of this range in future and iron out those creases it will be onto a winner
8298,5.0,product is good received an intact iphone delivered one day before the mentioned date bought in gb red

8302,3.0,great cut and fit tts size fit my pound frame bc bust wonderfully my sister and best friend loved it on but im returning the color is more of a very bright orange than red i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the allpolyester fabric is hot i have too many dresses in my closet cute as it is id just never pick this one love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options longer would also be a slightly better length
8303,4.0,contacts option in this mobile system is not appropriate one as there is no direct showing option to save number like whether to save in sim or sim i mean it is little bit weird one main camera quality is not good but the selfie camera is good that too not much front camera should also be equipped with flash but there is no option so next time we are hoping for better camera quality with flash system for selection of sims for mobile network we have to go again in settings there is no direct option above the screen
8304,5.0,love it sight impaired great help to me
8305,4.0,good service good discount but expect more
8306,4.0,the description on the amazon page calls this a class card with uhs performance and while technically correct full hd p recording you would expect more performance in the sequential write speeds it actually doesnt even hit the class speed unless you round up mbs i have of these cards and they both report the same speed my kingston gb sdhc class writes at mbs now keep in mind the sandisk beats the other cards in the random reads and writes so maybe the design for those faster random reads and writes causes the sequential writes to run slower than expected here is the test for the san disk followed by the kingstoncrystaldiskmark c hiyohiyocrystal dew world sandisk ultra gb class micro sdhc uhs i speed mbs bytes sata bytessequential read mbssequential write mbsrandom read kb mbsrandom write kb mbsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopstest mb f gb xdate os windows home premium edition sp build xcrystaldiskmark x c hiyohiyocrystal dew world kingston gb sdhc class mbs bytes sata bytessequential read mbssequential write mbsrandom read kb mbsrandom write kb mbsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopsrandom read kb qd mbs iopsrandom write kb qd mbs iopstest mb f mb xdate os windows home premium edition sp build x

8309,1.0,pathetic product not worth the money whatsoever cheap build and slow soft buy a samsung phone instead
8310,4.0,i saw this top online and read the reviews that it was running small i am normally an xxs in most retailer clothing i am for reference found it in the store and took both the xs and small in to try on the reviewers were right i tried the xs on first and it was quite snug and short the small fit perfectly it was a bit longer too great style and soft fabric once you size up youll love it
8311,1.0,nope it was just blahhhh the only thing it did was weigh my hair down and make it feel sticky it did smell really good though
8312,4.0,i ordered down a size based on other reviews i am tall lbs and a size is a great fit i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone

8322,3.0,i love j brand however the fit of these jeans was all wrong for me they were perfect from the knee up however they stuck out too much at the bottom a slight taper from the knee down would have made them perfect i had to return them
8323,5.0,the samsung m comes with a inch touchscreen display and an aspect ratio of this power packed device with a mah supports fast charging and is powered by a ghz octacore samsung exynos processor that features cores clicked at ghz and cores clocked at ghz and gb ram and gb storage this device runs on android oreo and packs rear cameras and megapixel each and a megapixel front facing selfie camera for perfect selfie shots in my personal opinion this phone is a win win when it comes to value of money and great features
8324,1.0,display stopped working immediately in days
8325,3.0,cant see much special of pros it has mostly common feature like every another android phone cons very short and low quality charging cable feel like local street market stuff camera details are very bad even in normal modes and day light when zoomed its pixels start breaking a lot performance not upto mark it doesnt lag but its not that fast as expected as per battery capacity charger is very slow even after its fast charging i am disappointed with samsung and this device they could have done better
8326,3.0,as of now no issues but the side cover of the power bank where we put in the usb came out for no reason each time it comes out i try to press it back but again it comes out better durability expected and you can charge one time for full n half battery for the second charge
8327,1.0,one of the worst phone i have ever purchased i have bought this phone from amazon sale i am the st time user of samsung on th day of purchase when i want to open camera to shoot a video my phone got restart every time after that phone starting heating i went to samsung care they tell problem in software we have to re load the software but after re loading the software the same issues continued now they are saying camera hardware issue we have to open the mobile and if necessary we have to change the camera fully annoyed with amazon and samsung friends dont buy this phone camera battery software worst than any brand in market
8328,4.0,this product is good for this price
8329,4.0,good quility phone ever
8330,1.0,the only good things about this shampoo is the package and the smell it is waaaay to thick builds up on my hair and makes my hair feel like straw dont waste your monie
8331,2.0,an overwhelming quotmehquot my hair always gets more staticky in the fallwinter so i was looking for a product that would help with that this didnt damage my hair but it didnt help it at all i didnt like the texture of the product either it was too thick almost kind of grainy and really difficult to get out of the bottle its also expensive for a little amount of product there are better things than this out there
8332,3.0,pro good battery life average sound face recognition good con bad front camera charging time hour to full charge fast charger doest seems charging fast slow app response time
8333,4.0,its picture quality is nice apect to more phone better sound quality is best in phone and battery lifeb is good for gaming and taking
8334,3.0,this mobil is not up to the mark having issue with ram speed and battery backup
8335,3.0,i loved the lines in this jacket but ended up returning it because they didnt show up how i expected the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit s on my usual s and wasnt quite what i was looking for
8336,3.0,this shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasnt as soft as i thought it would be i was hoping they would be the super soft material maybe washing them would help but i didnt want to chance it so i returned them
8337,5.0,this shampoo and the corresponding conditioner are amazing ive been using the organix argan original and argan creme lines for about months and decided to give this one go good lord my hair looks amazing my overall experience with organix has left my hair super soft and shiny but the sea mineral really enhanced my naturally wavy hair most shampoos weigh my hair down and get rid of my natural wave but i look like a beach goddess after using this my waves are smooth defined bouncy and flowy the smell is pleasant and lingers on my hair after washing will definitely repurchase all my wavyhaired girls definitely give this a try
8338,1.0,bad camera bad light bad video bad network
8339,3.0,i found it hard to pair with bottoms fit wasnt very flattering for me
8340,1.0,losing pictures video and tunes after months on a samsung galaxy note stock android looks like this is a common problem i will try my luck with sandisk on monday if i dont get a replacement i will never buy a sandisk product again i paid the premium for sandisk quality i am very disappointedupdatesandisk will be providing a replacement sd card however my data loss and downtime cannot be replaced sandisk lost their premium rating in my eyes its going to take a while for them to get it back
8341,2.0,i had high hopes for this dress but unfortunately was disappointed and returned the dress it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist its so odd
8342,3.0,the phone is good however speaker output quality is not so clear anyhow i recommend this product coz it is worth for that price
8343,3.0,all over good product but its battery worst
8344,2.0,i tried on this sweaterlove the flowing top and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline wrong the seam came right across my bust on a medium sized up to a large same thing this shouldnt happen not sure who this would actually flatter the sweater is high quality and the colors are perfect the fit needs work
8345,2.0,maybe i got a lemon but she never hears me and i have to keep repeating very annoying
8346,3.0,the tv is good the only issue i encountered was i was unable to screen share or cast the mobile screen chromecast works fine though
8347,2.0,and this one proved to be no different the short end of it this dress is pretty much super thick heavy linen with a rope like collar the supposed embroidery you see and there is no lining but completely unnecessary pockets im typically a or depending on the designer a super fit lbs and knew enough to order an xs in this however it still fit like a potato sack even upon taking it out of the plastic bag i knew it was going back between the unrealistic pictures and lack
8348,3.0,i dont whats wrong with my a almost every game lags on it other than that the phone is well balanced in all segments
8349,1.0,like someone said smells like an old lady perfume quite expensive and did not work well for my dyed long straight hair scalp and hair felt very oily might be difficult to squeeze out the product from the bottle
8350,3.0,it works but in market there are better options available in terms of speed samsung evo for example
8351,3.0,i love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top the fabric is nice but the big boxy shape on the bottom doesnt do much for you i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump returning the top
8352,3.0,its is tooo heating
8353,4.0,this price best mobile
8354,1.0,not a worthy product touch is not so good need to press it times to do any task facing network with this product battery life seems to be ok facing heating issue this product is so heavy i have to use my hands to handle it cant use it with hand hangs some times please dont buy this not worth it
8355,4.0,i bought this phone for my father his primary use is calling whats app facebook and youtube hence went for a phone which has good screen and longer battery this phone has everything going for it except the camera it costed me after off on sbi card and got extra cash back in amazon pay good form factor easy to hold light weight considering mamp battery very good and vibrant screen dolby atmos very very good sound through good set of headphones humongous battery lasts almost for days things that are not up to mark are camera really disappointed with the camera quality xiaomi note pro my friend has it the phone back cover has dual color which looks cheap external mobile cover is recommended
8356,5.0,well designed product
8357,1.0,display problem occurs within months
8358,4.0,overall good product good deal panasonic installation is also quick done next day
8359,1.0,this bad camera also it is not supported with triggers and extra flash his given point is not compatible with other brands for beginners if he buy only cannon flash and trigger very costly and photo quality also bad my i phone quality is much more better then this dslr useless camera dont waste your money i already wasted
8360,1.0,this top is beautiful in design but sadly i will be returning it is hand wash and even after doing so i had unraveled threads resulting in large holes unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing
8361,3.0,i have purchased this watch almost days back after days i observed that initially the battery ends in days but after few days the battery ends in hrs only is it the battery faulty or hardware is faulty
8362,3.0,i like this phone battery backup and glossy design
8363,2.0,didnt expected mp camera acts like this very worst pics outcome no detailing when we zoom the pics screen unlock with sensor is opening when others trird to open the lock screen unlocks even we close the eyes all music applications are pausing after sometime of playing music no back cover too provided with which quick scratches are guaranteed extremely dissatisfied and all reviews shown hype regarding camera hope something fishy
8364,4.0,using for months good battery life of hrs sound quality is fine can be connected to two devices at a time the buttons for forward and previous tracks doesnt work properly if you are getting it for below go for it overall its good
8365,2.0,i got this because it claimed to reduce breakage but it just made me look a mess i have fine long wavy hair and this serum made it look like i poured oil on my head and just left it there i couldnt style it and it just hung in limp chunks i only put one pump in so im not sure how much less i could have used i think the smell was lovely but i could tell in my hands it was sticky and thick and probably not a fit for my fine hair i imagine people with more robust hair would have a better experience
8366,3.0,i really wanted to love this top i got it in xs in peach the color is beautiful i wish they had this exact same color in the boardwalk stroll top the v neck was way too low and i dont want to have to wear a tank underneath i would be willing to try an xxs but its been sold out for awhile now and looks like its not coming back if the size were smaller v neck higher up and the top portion of the dress more fitted it would be the perfect tee
8367,5.0,wonderful screen quality camera is also good battery life is superb it wont feel like middle range phone many times i feel i own a high range phone compass sensor is a surprise thanks for samsung for coming up with this quality product i am totally satisfied i am not heavy gamer not checked from that aspect especially wide angle photo feature is very useful photo has lot of details
8368,3.0,good space inside and cooling is also good but the freezer is absolutely waste always opens the freezer and water is leaking always
8369,1.0,no return policy in many cases external apps not working no smart features worst customer servicessupport
8370,2.0,still needs a lot of refinement to alexa needs to understand different accents and dialects
8371,2.0,the color and quality of this sweater are fantastic the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didnt seem right to me it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneckcowl i will be returning the sweater because of that
8372,1.0,not working now
8373,1.0,i ordered this memory card for my drift ghosts action camera i started getting errors and the camera was freezing and saying there was a storage problem i assumed the camera was faulty and actually exchanged it for another camera same errors i switched to a sandisk extreme card and never had problems againif youre going to be recording hd video especially at high frame rates then do not get this card im sure it would be fine in any other scenario though but its advertised as a class uhs card and its just not as fast as other class uhs cardsdrift innovation the company that makes the ghosts camera i use has stated in multiple support tickets with me not to use any sandisk ultra cards because they do not perform fast enough for the camera and will result in slow card errors they work ok until you try recording p video at higher frame rates

8376,2.0,i bought this because i love coconut and will give anything that smells tropicalcoconutty a try i love the smell of this and id probably say it has a slightly nicer scent than the organix coconut milk conditioner after using it my hair felt smooth and hydrated when i got out of the shower but as soon as it dried my hair was back to its frizzy self so it didnt really do much i had to use loads of serum to make my hair look half decent

8384,3.0,this review is the same as the conditioner from the same line as i always use both together im doing a combined review meh thats all i got to say in my experience its not as bad as other reviewers are saying but its not a good product either i love the smell smells like sweet coconut and not the beachy salty coconut smell of sunscreen but the smell doesnt linger in my hair i used the conditionner and the shampoo together for a while and my hair felt ok they were not really nourished by this product

8395,2.0,i frequently use the echo to listen to music or news npr the problem is whenever it is playing something it wont be able to hear you when you try to get it pause the music or change stations even from a moderate distance and when playing at a normal volume so you end up sitting there yelling its name trying to get it to respond all the while its ignoring you its like having a teenager in the house in the end you have to walk over there and press the button at which point you might as well have just bought a radio
8396,4.0,volume of speaker is low as compared other bluetooth speaker
8398,5.0,the patterscolors on this dress are much more stunning in person it is lined and feels very well made the pockets dont add bulk to the hip area as many times they do which is great the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves if you can try this one on in a store before buying for reference i am have broad shoulders am pear shaped i have hips and a good sized rear end b bust weigh lbs and generally wear a size or for tops and bottoms the size fit
8399,3.0,i loved the blue brocade since its a little unusual paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap fortunately it doesnt the top of the dress was fitted i wore my usual size what i didnt expect though is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon which runs just below the bust the photo online shows a li

8401,4.0,i love my echo dot as it controls my lights and things but it is limited in terms of finding information i cant ask alexa certain questions that i can ask google for example alexa is also limited to the us i am here in jamaica and i cant access amazon music unlimited because am not in the us big disappointment alexa is very good and need to be fully supported by all countries or english countries at leastthe skill section need much improvement also we should be able to link our youtube and google to alexa that would be great i would give star but because of these limitations apart from that great product makes life so much easier

8403,3.0,thanks to apple for stealing peoples money i was using plus from almost year and after ios upgrade it started lagging and most of the apps started crashing never saw this issue as i used iphone and as well they intentionally released the new ios with bugs so that either you will end up with their service center or you will buy a upgraded model so before buying any iphone make sure you know these kind of tricks from apple
8404,3.0,this vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful but the fit is very off you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs and made my waist look wide it also ran small

8423,3.0,this top is gorgeous beautiful lace substantial fabric great color but it looked so weird on me i have broader shoulders and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model they just stuck straight out as another reviewer mentioned the fabric is stiff i didnt want to size up because the body and length both fit well perhaps if you have smaller rounded shoulders this top will hang better for reference im lbs and tried a size s

8425,5.0,i just got this skirt in the mail and im absolutely delighted with it id ordered both my normal size and one size up taking a tip from the reviewer whod found it snug but my usual retailer size fit beautifully i do have narrow hips though so maybe its snug on more curvaceous figures the fabric is so soft and supple and ive already tried the skirt with several widely varying shoe styles so i can confirm its versatility it looks feminine with heeled sandals as in the pictur

8427,5.0,i ended up with two of these after mistakenly purchasing the regular sized sd cards for hikvision security cameras only to find that they needed the micro sd cards instead they installed and formatted with no issues and are working well in the camerasthe best thing about sandisk is that they have a lifetime warranty with these cards unlike some of the other brandsi purchased these for dollars each and are reasonably priced around that

8432,5.0,great mobile apple never disappoints us
8433,5.0,works as expected i suspect this is why so many people trust sandisk i hope they stick with maintaining the integrity their products have earned i often pay a little more from sandisk but i have never been disappointed with their products as i have others like adata in fairness to adata who failed to make good on any of the several defective products i purchased from them i have never had to test sandisks warranty as ive never had a failure perhaps their product support is just as bad as adatas but ive never had the opportunity to test it

8445,4.0,i have to pick up every new oil that organix comes out with and i was curious about this one when it showed up at target i think macadamia oil is lighter than argan oil and their last line of argan products was a little too heavy for my hair on some days i still love the argan oil spray on very dry hair but this one seems more fluid and absorbs better into the hair shaft i dont mind that it doesnt spray on and i prefer to use it on damp hair
8446,2.0,i am writing this review after using the phone for one month left speaker is not working camera quality is not good pictures taken are blur when the phone is ringing on call sound is not proper sound is tearing there are many missing features in phone memory cart slot is not there we can not change message and call settings seperately messages always bothers when phone is on general profile phone starts hanging from th day of use battery is also not good it is draining after hours of use i am not satisfied with the phone worst phone i have ever purchased

8459,4.0,this dress is so cute and i received so many compliments on it i wore it on a gameday and it was so comfortable i love the skirt of the dress because of the trendy vs the top was too loose for me so i had to get it taken in this is surprising because i have a decent sized chest and broad shoulders other than that this dress is a real winner
8460,5.0,love my new wardrobe addition fits perfect and goes with everything
8461,4.0,even though im currently at a f in the bust the size works for me although i did install snaps between the top buttons to keep everything in line im and my torso is often too short for regular sized clothes the straps were too long for me but to my delight i discovered that this particular dress is designed to unstitch and tailor the strap length with ease with those small alterations this dress fits like it was made for me plus the pattern and fabric are top notch i tried
8462,5.0,the print layers and fit of this dress remind me of the s but in a good way the outer dress is voluminous and flowy so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top i really appreciate that styling detail dd and i chose medium regular length not petite since im older and wanted the length
8463,5.0,this dress is a great color fabric and the style is very flattering im wearing to a wedding but it will be great for many events this fall dressy enough for a cocktail party but could also wear to church

8466,1.0,i bought this to use with the cherry blossom ginseng shampoo i wanted more volume with my hair because i was using another line with this brand dont do this its a very bad idea my hair went from soft and silky to dry and shiny without volume not really what i was trying for blah this has no hydration behind it i feel its very lacking i need to return it

8469,4.0,comes with the sd card converter good size for camera memory it reduces your need to change it so often
8470,3.0,im torn on this one thats why i give it a i cant decide if i like it or not the first thing is its a heavier oil than i expected in the grocery store ive purchased macadamia oil for cooking and its a much thinner oil i know they have to add stuff to make it more suited to hair styling but it was much heavier than i thought it would be contrary to a heavy oil i flat ironed my hair with this and the ends were dry and more split end looking im not blaming organix for the state of my hair as im guilty of heavy styling but id expect a heavy oil like this to smooth my ends other organix hair serums smoothed my ends wonderfully and so does the got b smoothing serums maybe this isnt meant for a person like myself maybe it works well for someone who isnt a heavy styler and hasnt bleached their hair more than once i might buy it again but only to use on damp hair i would then add another product for heat protection on top of the dry styling oil maybe ill use it to smooth the ends after ive styled

8476,2.0,product is advertised to be a monster was happy to gift to my brother who was looking forward to use it however the fun ended when an obstructive band was discovered in the sim card tray which bent the tray and made the removing and inserting the tray difficult this is a physical structural defect amazon doesnt have any pro active helpline tried number of times to register my product return in vain also tried repeatedly in vain to call them or get them call me so my brother us stuck with a defective phone and were unable to get any help the two starts awarded are for the samsung brand as it has been quite good so far
8477,2.0,im not sure what it is with ag i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans in blue black and white denim i wish i could say theyre all great but unfortunately theres a big variation in how they wash depending on the fabric content i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring but after washing them once i can see they wont be a favorite pair even with cold water and hanging them to dry the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes at this price po

8484,2.0,earphone was missing
8485,1.0,i thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high in fact two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid however as we were looking at the items we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality as the previous reviewer noted therefore none of us purchased the pants the staff at the store were very helpful
8486,4.0,some scretch in air book

8493,4.0,i was somewhat hesitant to purchase this dress based on the previous reviews for me it fit perfect the blouse was fine not too much fabric the skirt is soft and stretchy the fit was tts for reference i am lbs c and i purchased the p it fits great
8494,3.0,i bought this phone mainly for battery but even having mah battery this phone battery life limits to day my previous phone had a battery of mah and it works well for one day so for the same usage this phone battery drains faster it comes with a very short charging cable samsung should work on that as well
8495,4.0,mi a is a good phone though not bezel less this phone has a good aspect ratio the screen is great better than note pro i might add though it has only gb ram this may be a problem for tech lovers but android one gives a big advantage that it gives around gb ram free always as compared to miui which is very heavy on a phonepictures are a lot better than note pro because of googles photography algorithms front camera is amazing battery backup is quite good works all day with wifi on and games i am impressed all in all a good combo of xiaomi with googles android one
8496,4.0,i loved wearing this outside on a hot day the fabric is a nice quality you cant tell in the photos but it is a jerseyknit fabric the color labeled red that looks orange is actually coral its a nice color i usually wear a true size and thats what i ordered but i found that it is slightly big i can wear it but would have preferred half a size to a full size smaller a versatile dress that you can wear often
8497,1.0,this will not connect to any google product might as well throw out your chromecasts and google play music subscriptions if you want to get any use out of this piece of garbage
8498,2.0,i wanted these culottes to work so much the fabric is gorgeous but the size i ordered didnt fit im normally a size in pants and i ordered a size it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area not what i wanted it to be had to return them unfortunately
8499,4.0,i have used it for day and no complaints till now build quality is good very light weight sound quality is good it has super extra bass so those who dont like extra bass have to think on it before buying battery life is also good hour minutes saw movies in a day along with attending calls charging time is approx hours one of the good features i like that when you connect to android phone it shows headphones battery icon next to bluetooth icon that battery icon show how much charge is left
8500,3.0,this dress would have been perfect in a medium petite beautiful dress wish i had sized down
8501,3.0,i had such high hopes for this top it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable the lacebeadwork is extremely itchy the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me
8502,3.0,i thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe and while the color didnt disappoint everything else did its a very loose slub so its very see through and thin id have to wear a cami under it also the tie front has a very high slit like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga gym wear but definitely not at this price pass for me sadly
8503,4.0,its a nice phone at its price point nice large screen with rich colours and good battery life for videos the camera quality is good returns good pics even in dark through autobrightness touch also works as expected though it lacks fast charge owing to large battery you dont really miss it much for me phone has gone through days without having to charge the look and feel is just ok nothing special dark green color looks premium but the premium ness ends there
8504,5.0,i saw this instore tried it on and was sold it is not just super soft but very flattering on i am petite lbs and bought the xs in black the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans
8505,3.0,i love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin not as great so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished
8506,3.0,product is nice audio quality is good but the build quality is very bad after months of usage the wire of the headphone jack started to break that is the only problem that i have with this earphone
8507,4.0,display
8508,5.0,lovely summer top comfortable and cool for hot summer days beautiful fabric fits tts highly recommend
8509,5.0,i like honor mobile camera and backside glass
8510,4.0,though the phone has android one and sd it lags like hell sometimes this lag irritates me like i want to through the phone out of the window when the internet of sim is active in your phone and youre calling someone from sim even the wifi stops working that is very strange the rest is good
8511,4.0,loved it loved the color too only problem was the charger there should have been its own charger instead of just wire but product is nice lets hope it lasts for a long time
8512,2.0,i ordered this in size xl the ivory was as pictured the lace details were welldone but the length was much shorter than on the model im ft in for reference even the sleeves were on the short side above my wrists the main problem is how much it shed just in trying it on there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters this one just didnt work out
8513,3.0,i read prior reviews and decided to go forward with my purchase i am so pleased that i did the m fit nicely the fabric is not as soft as i had wished however i think with wear it will become broken in
8514,1.0,signal reception very pathetic front and rear camera clarity very poor process struck without aditoanl applications not even earphones provided with product min required built in app like network flow in status bar missing so many cons fake reviews made this product selling samsung stop selling this model its not upto mark
8515,1.0,does not work i have a card purchased at best buy that looks identical side by side but transferring music onto the best buy purchased card was extremely fast meg albums transferred in to seconds on these cards a meg album was at minutes remaining with less than a quarter of the album transferred i bought two so i figured maybe a bad card tried the other same thing extremely slow wonder if they are even real
8516,4.0,the sound quality is nice but its not as loud as i expected bt it is good
8517,5.0,has been a month i am using fitbit versa it fits like it was customized for my hand love the features dont have to carry my heavy phone while going for a run will buy more accessories to fit in with my formal cloths when iwatch is talking about hrs of battery life fitbit versa has days of battery life specially heart rate is much accurate than any other trackers
8518,2.0,the review above titled so disappointed couldnt have said it any better the dresses from last year are perfect i probably wear them at least once a week i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year im generally an xs or s in dresses however i have xxs from last years version and the xs in this one is lifeless its heavy hot doesnt have the same nice shape as last year i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres
8519,4.0,one thing that is highlight for u is its fingerprint respone time it is far much better then other mid range phone front camera is great but rear camera sucks great phone in its price range
8520,4.0,i tried this in the store after looking at it online the material was soft and flexible which was nice i had been concerned that it might be stiff however it was a bit difficult to get on and off with the zipper on the back and the high neckline overall as a petite person i felt the spots were too overwhelming for me but if you like the spots and have no trouble with back zippers go for it
8521,2.0,poor battery heating issue and worst experience with amazon this time after days of troubleshooting they are still waiting for technicians to get data physically they wants customer to wait for days so technician will visit and verify each and every thing for replacement worst experience with amazon and worst policy of amazon with regards to replacement or return of faulty device
8522,5.0,product is good compare to another power bank because navvy blue is rich colour and great design and slim low weight mi power bank is a great power bank and cheep price compare to another power bank
8523,3.0,picture quality not gud
8524,5.0,i bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here i think the length is perfect so many of the tees etc are extra long so its nice to have a variety to chose from im and this little tee hits right where my legs begin it is very free flowing and cool i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot
8525,5.0,i love this tee the material is thick but not too thick its highly flattering i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings the shimmer on the front adds something special
8526,2.0,battery is very very poor
8527,1.0,phone does not work properly it hangs after every mins
8528,2.0,i used this product with my dell venue pro after a couple months of use it stopped letting me add new files or delete old onesi tried reformatting and wiping the disk but nothing worked since the vast majority of the reviews appear to be positive i assume i just got a bad one
8529,5.0,i love this dress i didnt think that i would feel at ease as it is very formfitting but it is so comfortable and warm it is dressy yet casual i have received many compliments
8530,3.0,probably should have returned this but its just so pretty i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but its extremely long tucking it in will be toughwhere do you put all that length aside from that it is beautiful the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues gold neutrals hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt great buyi just wonder how ill wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a closet sitter
8531,1.0,bed fiture in mobile
8532,5.0,this top is awesome i purchased the gold color in a small fits perfectly and true to size sleeves are nice and long definitely recommend
8533,5.0,nuce
8534,5.0,i am not into buying hair products for fun especially if it has esoteric ingredients names written in big letter across the packaging i bought this one because my hair seemed very dry this winter and it was also on special for dollars i let it sit for about minutes and followed with morocanoil as usual my hair is so soft there is no more dry strand flying around its the second time i use it in two weeks and i will definitely buy more of it if its on sale if you have color treated fine to medium hair i recommended it
8535,1.0,received damage headphone just like used ite
8536,2.0,this is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed it is extremely well fitted in the chest the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric i am normally a at retailer and the was extremely small
8537,2.0,the super positive reviews on this product outside of mua made me buy it unfortunately i am the first person reviewing this product in makeupalley which in my opinion has the most reliable reviews anyway this product does not live up to its promises when using it as a deep treatment in the shower your hair can get super heavy and dull and when using a very small amount it does not bring desirable results either very poor performance definitely not usable as a deep treatment no matter how much or how little you use using it as a leave in is much better from my experience but still the results are very mediocre the ends are crunchy yet greasy and beware if you use it on almost dry hair be ready for a greasy mess you know what the main problem with this product is the terrible thick film it leaves on your hair wanna know the name beeswax i shouldve known why would they put beeswax in this i mean the scent is nice the conditioner is very thick as a butter duh d but i honestly see no use for this my hair is not even damaged it just tends to get dry this is supposed to be pure moisture and contains no protein whatsoever if it was very mediocre with my hair i honestly cant tell what it would do with your hair if you love heat or dyes all in all i find organix products to be very mediocre and its a shame that you can get much better hair with herbal essences or dove whats the organic thing in these products if they have effing beeswax heck even herbal essences silicones are water soluble sad because the packaging of this is beautiful dont fall for the marketing ladies not going to spend a penny in organix products anymore completely disappointed
8538,5.0,superb sound some people are complaining that bass is in sufficient if u wear it properly u will find that the bass is superb i compared it with original samsung earphone worth rs this is one far superior

8543,4.0,awesome product worth purchasing its really very compact n easy to handle drawback is that the usb cable is very small i would suggest that check the seller before you buy it matters
8544,3.0,i didnt end up keeping this dressit just wasnt right for me it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin partially lined which is a plus and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slitvent was just too high for my liking the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only i guess i just didnt love it and would rather save my funds for something i ca
8545,1.0,device build quality and touchscreen interface is very good tracking seems ok like other trackers the app is awful wont connect at all for me the app would connect via bluetooth only once and if disconnected either bluetooth switched off or due to distance it never reconnected switching on and off phone watch or bluetooth nothing worked had to delete device from app and reinstall same thing again you cant keep your watch and phone together and bluetooth switched on perpetually am using a honor x running android later read its a common issue with versa and huawei phones cant review other features of the versa as i never got it to work longer than a day
8546,5.0,still using my phone it has given me satisfaction of a strong and sturdy phone with enjoying it daily for all my official as well as personal life

8550,3.0,nice jeans just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them thats why i returned them otherwise fine
8551,2.0,i had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be it was tts im and usually wear a small but the material was horribly scratchy both the body of the top as well as the sleeves and the design isnt all that flattering it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life
8552,1.0,its so so works half the time
8553,3.0,i bought oneplus t on th of september my charger was not working after days of my purchase how to get charger through warranty
8554,1.0,this is s gb ram product
8555,3.0,not compaitable with nokia
8556,1.0,one month in the usage the paint on the back panel started to come off and that too when i had it in a cover all the time i am using a matte black finish the company doesnt take any responsibility for the quality of surface finish that the phone has there are quite a lot of users worldwide facing the same issue but the company has turned a blind eye to it shame that a company like apple would do this to its customers one expects a certain level of quality while purchasing a phone worth bucks
8557,3.0,sound quality is ok at this price range mic is a big plus
8558,1.0,there is no sim ejector tool inside the box
8559,1.0,very very waste this tv sound quality not good picture quality everything is not good high price

8561,1.0,im usually a fan of maeve but this dress is just bad the fabric is thin and filmy and it stretches to sheer over your chest the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose it just droops in a most unfortunate way
8562,5.0,phone is very good and i like it very much

8566,1.0,after unboxing i just recieved only accesoriesthere was no phone in the box please dont buy this phone in this sale
8567,2.0,this is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer i was so excited for the shirt it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures the flax is very scratchy marring the softness of the rest of the fabric the top half is totally sheer requiring a cami the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way unnecessarily adding visual pounds finally the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches longwh
8568,4.0,loses novelty fast still trying to learn new functions but looks like very limited however my kids enjoy playing and asking questions
8569,3.0,i dont know why this piece is so wide around the body the fabric is very good just the design is way boxy i get xsp still boxy
8570,3.0,everything is good but camera is very very disappointing worts camera due to camera quality the whole impression on the phone is lost very noisy and blur photos in artificaial lighting seems this camera is not designed in it looks like very old camera in old and cheap phones camera in xiaomi phones are greater than this camera which are available for just to phones charging k and providing this camera is not at all digestive i expected flagship range performing camera i think honor have cheated and misleaded customers providing the same camera which are used in their budget phones like honor x and honor c when photos are clicked in portrait mode black photos are outcoming i recieved an update yesterday and no use of it honor should look into it and give an update
8571,5.0,i am lbs and bought the petite which is what i normally wear and it fits perfectly the quality of the fabric and stitching is good not great and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment but for me the style the fit and the fact that it doesnt seem to show wrinkles at least not before washing turned it in to a keeper for me the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it i tried the ada belt with it but found i
8572,5.0,ultimately mobile camera quality is good

8579,5.0,i have featured photos below im feet and lbs and d i purchased a small petite the fabric is cotton i thought it would be rayon it is lined with cotton fabric the skirt has major poof it falls like a midi on a petite the waist runs high which can not be a good thing for a busty gal why do i love it the pattern is one of a kind the colors are so fall i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look i cant resist this skirt if your tall this is a dream if your petite you can
8580,1.0,wow and i mean that in a bad way this shampoo left my hair matted and dried so badly that no one conditioner could reverse it i threw on every conditioner in the house just to be able to work my fingers through my hair whats up with these quotnaturalquot shampoos and conditioners my hair ends up brittle frizzed and dried out no matter what brand i use im done with these i gave it a just because i liked the smell im not buying again and i dont recommend it for anything other than hand soap
8581,4.0,wooooooooooohoooooooooo great build quality classic looks premium feel the thing caught my attention was the per key rgb keyboard its beautiful feels great when typing the rgb logo on the lid gives premium touch cpu theres nothing about the cpu as everyone knows its performance gpu this is what matters its performance temperatures clock speeds overclocking i tested witcher wild hunt as of now i would say i am extremely satisfied with the performance it averaged fps on p ultra settings which is similar to rtx laptop it goes neck to neck with rtx laptop for k lesser at cost of rtx effects using msi after burner the constant clock speed sits at mhz and swings through mhz mhz mhz sometimes even mhz on turbo mode and overclocking this surprised me as the official website shows it can reach mhz on turbo mode it gets damn hot folks but it a very common thing in gaming laptops with difference of few degrees and this laptop is very thin and light for the premium looks feel thin and light weight i would give up the thermals battery i dont know it is showing me surprise results will test it later for accurate results it supports raid configuration if you want crazy speeds of read and write overall its premium package with premium performance
8582,5.0,overall its good
8583,1.0,this stuff is ridiculously overpriced in australia i grabbed a bottle of this conditioner on sale i love coconut scented things unfortunately this is where my praise ends i have long fine hair which is not particularly problematic except that it can tangle easily the description made this conditioner sound perfect for my hair type but i was really disappointed it simply does not detangle my hair and this can only cause damage in the longrun im not sure but maybe my hair and protein do not get along i also hate this packaging anything where i need to shake a bottle with wet hands to get product out gets a thumbs down from me i am now using this to shave my legs with its really good for that at least
8584,3.0,this was so ridiculous on me im usually a xs so i ordered the xs the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum and i mean barely the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it love the colors fabric and the nonelasticized waist if you are under this might work for you in nonpetite sizing
8585,1.0,where are the ear pods with lightning connector wired
8586,2.0,guys its really worst mobile if u compare to red mi or other mobiles whever i was purchase this mobile nd day onwards mobile continuously switch off restart changing issue and it is ok for cheaper price but dont have a quality mobile as per my experience so dont fall for cheaper price

8589,4.0,need too improve bass quality
8590,3.0,i bought this sweater in dark grey in the store i really loved it at first its very soft and cozy and fits really well i especially like that its long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings however the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves however my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing th
8591,5.0,im a big ag fan so i was excited to receive these for my birthday i really love everything about them but boy were they long even with a inch heeled boot i was stepping on the hem im so i dont often have to get things hemmed but that was a must with these jeans i recommend these jeans but unless youre foot tall plan on running them to the tailors
8592,4.0,i really liked these jeans i had to return though they run small i normally wear a and could have gone for a in these maybe it was because i went for the petite they can run a bit smaller
8593,3.0,despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric and has perfect fit nice arm length looks good on the hanger the jacket did me no justice at all it arrived folded in the mail so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag so i pressed the jacket tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail the pleats would not stay put
8594,1.0,would not waste my money

8596,2.0,i was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip i already had my outfits planned when these pants arrived however they were very different from those shown in the pictures online firstly the pants are in actuality quite cropped i am the model in the pictures is at least that height if not taller and the hems were several inches above my ankles secondly the pants appear to be an even wider cut than whats shown although the width of the pant legs may have
8597,5.0,overall performance is good
8598,3.0,have only transfered some pictures and music so far my s galazy had no problems recognizing the cardhear a lot of rumors about memory cards not working having to format first etc but this one worked from me right out of the boxthe included adapter is also good when i want to use with my computers for slide shows since microsdhc are not supported by many if anyjust to small
8599,3.0,this is very bad adaptar is missing only gb memory card is there adaptar is shown there but they did not provide it
8600,1.0,bad service amazon product defective i can understand but what about your services zero star i have video but its size is mb m upload it as soon as possible after compressed
8601,5.0,needs little to no formatting and i have yet to see a sandisk fail dont cut corners almost every other brand of sd cards will fail on you except these tried numerous brands with my devicesjust remember it takes a bit for devices to buffer the information off of the sd card and static can corrupt any sd card which is usually easily fixed with a formatting always back up your documents to a pcmac as soon as possibleoh and if you create playlists slideshows etc on devices and remove the sd card the device will not be smart enough to recompile it after you put the sd card back in and you will end up with blank playlists even though you have the songs so watch outlastly if this sd card doesnt work for you for whatever reason google sd card formatting and it should help you out these gb versions dont seem to have formatting issues like the gb ones do but even then formatting to fat fixes it
8602,1.0,sound clarity is very very poor
8603,1.0,absolutely terrible product it died on its own dont think i just got unlucky i handled the device with care and now they quote me k to repair this piece of garbage please dont buy this
8604,3.0,i like everything in this the screen processor battery backup speed performance fingerprint reader face recognization i dislike the most in this phone is camera performance the clarity is not good actually very bad in night light and the colour correction is also not so good daylight as well as in night

8606,3.0,serves the purpose but there are a lot of grammatical mistakes

8612,2.0,getting more heat while charging ms cellphone no voice clatity while in call ie getting noise very less signal catching capability we cannot browse using phone most of time because less mobile data connectivity camera quality is not as expected as they have increased to mp given plastic back cover instead of metallic processor is getting slow when it reaches of local memory suggesting all users dont go for ms series mobiles in samsung brand they cheated customers for grab market
8613,1.0,the product that i received first from the amazon was found to be defective and then i replaced it i got a new phone after replacement then even the new replaced phone also hanged during the update process my experience of buying a brand new phone is worst with amazon it is very disappointing
8614,3.0,this would be perfect if only it were lined i have a high waist and hourglass shape so jumpers are very hard to find that fit my body type this is a perfect fit for my body shape and when on it looks like a lovely dress however it is not lined and the material is very light and ivory so you see everything you cant wear a slip so that leaves the option of some sort of bodysuit if you dont want to show the world what you have i am very tired of all of the light colored clothing not bei
8615,1.0,this is not a good product because it charges twice maximum of mah battery instead off mah mi products usually good in terms of quality and price but it is very bad in aspect of quality

8620,2.0,i was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isnt my first choice that was the least of the problems with this jacket i love sparkle and i love beautiful detail none of the elements by themselves was a problem the sum of the parts didnt work though the end result was an unflattering confusing mess the silhouette plus the frayed edges plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
8621,5.0,samsung gear s is super cool watch for all your needs highly recommended for sports and trekking usage battery life upto to days
8622,2.0,this skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on but was disappointed by the awkward ruching if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband thereby also shortening it to knee length it would have been lovely it should be noted that this is midilength which is awkward on me i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely
8623,1.0,just bought apple iphone s on monday i am disappointing first time with amazon main camera is not working i have called many times on customer care but have no solutions guide me what to do

8627,2.0,i ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail the floral design is nice but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt especially considering the price most disappointingly the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and thus could not even put the shirt on needless to say i will be returning it i ordered the xs so it is possible that larger sizes do n

8669,1.0,beware to anyone with sensitive skin that is breakout prone i have tried this product and the moroccan argan oil hair masque and both caused a reaction that i ended up going to the doc for i had low to mild grade folliculitis on the sides of my face and jaw for months before i figured out it was triggered by a product i was prescribed antibiotics and oral steroids to clear up the problem but neither made a lasting difference after the problem persisted i made a second doc visit this time he told me i was probably having a reaction to something i was using in my skincare or haircare and to remember what i was using before i started having these problems he gave me a shot for inflammation and prescribed attarax for the irritation i switched to head and shoulders and went back to the giovanni organics conditioner i had used in the past i have not figured out what ingredient or ingredients dont agree with my skin so i am just going to stay away from the whole line

8678,1.0,i bought this card on the strength of the gb xdsc sandisk in my phone right now it was a gift for a friend of mine and sadly it corrupted within minutes of first useinitially it worked fine then dead we checked in a laptop and windows disk management screen told me it had a single k partition and the rest was unusable outstandingthe replacement sent by amazon thank you amazon you are always excellent is sitting in my office right now i should probably check it out

8683,4.0,the sound quality is amazing it is completely light weight no doubt you will get value for you money by buying this product only issue is if you are buying it for answering your calls surely you will be dissatisfied because the mike is very sensitive and catches every sound in your surroundings and you will not be able to listen what you are talking

8687,4.0,i love the pattern and colors of this dress the quality of the fabric is great i initially ordered my usual size xs but found it a bit roomy so i ordered both an xsp and an xxs the xxs was more fitted and the xsp was too short in my opinion i am still on the fence about the xs and the xxs the xxs has a tighter fit but it is also tight in the bust and i wonder how it will be if i have to reach for something will it be too tight even though the xs runs slightly big i can still work with
8688,3.0,this top is not for a curvy figure the embroidered part is gorgeous very stunning but the loose bottom part is awful i am curvy and usually wear l or xl this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom made me feel like i had a big tummy and was a tad short i am sending this back this would look better on a more slender frame
8689,1.0,i hate it

8699,2.0,data transfer is not as mentioned on
8700,3.0,poor sound quality sometimes give late response

8703,1.0,i have ordered this product and it was not working with my tv it was not loading fire tv when i attached stick i have asked help of technical to visit and check whats the issue and fix it so that i can enjoy services of this product unfortunately noone can visit and check whats wrong i wish if someone would have come and check it as i am unsure if it was issue with stick or my tv

8706,2.0,this sweater is thick and does cover the bra well i did not find it to be well made the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering
8707,2.0,ordered this dress in an xs that is the size i usually wear this runs small but not only that it is the way it is cut very small through the hips thighs and legs hard to walk in it the material felt kind of cheap to me i thought it looked really good on the model but got it home and didnt like it at all it went back
8708,4.0,good phone at this budget using this from last days i got the phone gb gb for k after exchange and other offers rear camera quality is good with mp and other options also but saving photo takes sec in mp mode front camera is really good compared other brand mp front cameras battery life also good giving around hrs on moderate usage with continuous data on and without gaming but i expected little more battery life there is no hanging problem night mode is good blue light filtration also works good samsung would have gone for on screen fingerprint sensor which will definitely add much worth to this phone will update after few months

8716,2.0,used to be able to have echo play music for each of my boys echo unit but now they took all that away so now ill look at other streaming devices
8717,2.0,this top is too short so much so that tucking it in would be difficult the designs are lovely but the short length is putting this top back on the rack
8718,4.0,all the descriptions on the amazon site is accurate so can see the specifications i have got the gb gb ram with sapphire blue variation the outlook of the phone is very attractive now coming to the features i liked about the phone display the phone comes with a vibrant samoled pannel which has a great true color rendering capability processor the process is really fast enough for multitasking and no lag what so ever while opening a big file or playing a k video but i have not tasted for any gaming performance ui the custom ui made by samsung is just super fluid and loaded with lots of features like processor control simultaneous multi audio mode in different devices camera interface and many more camera in this budget this device has got really very good optical sensorscamera wide angle lense is a very good addition low light performance is up to the level battery as you know it has mah battery which lasts one and half day for me with about h screen on time with the fast charger you can full the battery from empty to full in about h sensors the gyroscope gps and magnetic field sensors works flawlessly it could lock the gps in few seconds it comes with two sim cards and one separate sd card slot no hybrid thats a great plus both sim cards support g volte simultaneously now the things which i dont like the display doesnt have a gorilla glass protection there is no notification led
8719,5.0,end bob bob the builder
8720,1.0,the slow motion in the night is very bad you cant see proper light the camera megapixel is not good it only optimizes to megapixel were as it doesnt give any sharpness or detail to the picture if you zoom the picture even little you can see the pixels glittering
8721,3.0,hi all i am writing review after weeks of usage looks like great improvement over m in terms of device specifications but only performance is good as it have newest processor exynos camera improvement is not good it is still ok camera fingerprint unlock is good and reliable not faced any issues yet but you can add only finger prints hoping if new updates can make it at least that would be good placement is little up than expected at the back it should be at the level where name samsung is printed also it would be really great if it can be on screen scanner in upcoming phones of this series as perice is around k inr mah battery is good but does not last full two days with low usage also lasts only for to days for gamers and heavy users it wont last full day also my daily usage is hours of games hours on chrome app whatsapp not in active use but go through it once or twice in an hour google music hours per day sometimes watching movies hours over wifi only opening camera apps only when needed i am not using google assistant also hoping for more battery optimization in upcoming updates screen touch is good and screen is bright as well for me to brightness is enough when compared to height to width ratio i feel phone is long than my old phone i feel it would be better is the width also little bit more no issues yet with long phone other that it is difficult to fit in shirt pocket the adaptive brightness is very sensitive faced few issues while gaming moving from one room to other even in same room sometimes i am very disappointed with the rear camera mp expecting good performance with samsung brand as i have seen best cameras from this brand in budget phones below k prices the pictures are not very sharp when compared with my older moto x play mp camera also on hdr mode it takes seconds post processing time also observed heating near fingerprint scanner and camera area after recording min video recording or playing games for over hour on my device not feeling heat on screen as in my moto x play while playing online games like pubg or clash of clans observed good size differences of image files in heic format vs nornal jpeg format front camera is good for video calls used for to calls average to mins calls expecting front flash on upcoming m series phones in earphone speakers are loud and clear but speakers can be louder as well felling less powerful when listening to music on speakers bottom side mm jack is new for me it will take some time for adjust to that rear panel is good in color mine is opal black version the back is black with some dark green shade little slippery on flat surfaces like table top kitchen counters tea table not seens any scratches after weeks but decided to go for phone cover to protect back still using screen without screen protector no scratches yet same as my moto x play but it has gorilla glass protectionthis has none hoping to buy a screen guard also not feeling very comfortable with the samsung keyboard will disable it and switch back to gboard or google indic keyboard free ram available is gb only out of gb installed gameplay is smooth for now i play pubg on balance graphics and high frame rate average of battery drain per hour not played till phone switching off but expect to have to hours gameplay life with these results i have only other apps installed from google play store disabled the motion themes switched to plain wallpapers power mode is always active blue screenfiler and night mode are on only from pm to am ist display brightness is between always adaptive brightness is always on i do not use always on display feature antutu benchmarks score is low as compared to same price range phone by other brands mine is showing html tests shows value of not ran any other benchmark apps software updates i think samsung is as slow as lenovo in this regard i received phone with august security patch not received new security patches yet overall phone is good choice if you are looking for a decent battery backup and performance with samsung brand name camera appperformance needs to be revised and updated to meet cuatomer expectations thats all for now will try to update my review after some more time
8722,1.0,can i give this stars oh man for the first week i loved this product she gave me workout advice told me the weather wrote my to do lists and even played the music i liked on command i told all my friends they needed one this week she has done nothing but cycle an annoying purposeless green light that i cant get rid of even though there are not incoming calls and now she flashes red and makes me re register or sign online every minutes i cant get through more than one song and i am stuck re connecting to the internet i tried a hard reset i have tried multiple times resetting my router but every single time i end up at a dead end with a red light and alexa telling me she doesnt understand im over this oh my f hell for real now echo wont skip songs she wont change volume she wont pick the genre of music i asked for she plays song before telling me sorry your echo dot lost connection
8723,4.0,good sd card and works fine with adapter satisfied with purchase of this product can fill it quickly though with hd video
8724,3.0,battery life is just one day and there are so many bugs in the software sometimes the screen doesnt come on
8725,1.0,takes a long time to charge and discharge
8726,2.0,no bass
8727,1.0,very bad phone starting time over hanging software problem dont trust redmi butamazon best selling trusted me
8728,3.0,everything is fine good but battery life is average
8729,4.0,k videos hang alwaysdont buy if your looking for a andriod tv but if your using only for setup box it is a good tv for that price
8730,4.0,purchased during prime days for i mostly use it for playing my hosted cd collection ripped and stored in the amazon cloud of course i also have the unlimited music servicei understand that amazon is continuing to develop alexa to make her more friendlyim pleased with alexa you just need to learn how to format your requestsi have it connected to a decent set of media speakers plan to connect to my new denon receiver
8731,4.0,not sure how to fully understand the importance of the unit i can find out scores of my favorite sports teams weather conditions and some news
8732,1.0,working very slow
8733,4.0,buying this phone in wouldnt make sense to a lot of people but for me this phone has everything that i need its got a great camera fantastic display having used iphones in the past i know this phone will stay with me for quite some time the notch is not a problem at all for me personally i dont see it most of the times it does have a premium feel and is pretty ergonomic if it fits your budget and if you like ios go for it the camera is great for daylight images but there are phones at a much economical price with better lowlight cameras battery life is decent if not the best but that mostly because my usage isnt as much as a gamer i would say however if youre looking for a phone to use for two years this is definitely a great pick
8734,3.0,this is a lightweight knit dress that is welldesigned but very formfitting i decided to return it because at almost there are parts of my body that i dont need to show but if youre in great shape or willing to wear shape wear this would be super cute
8735,1.0,i like this tv but after purchased week ram has been get problem then amazon refund the money
8736,2.0,i dont know how to explain but this dress at least for me did not look like the model first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts for me it didnt start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking so definitely not for my type of body i am normal height athletic and curvy body but maybe for a very tall person looks good the material is very interesting its so soft
8737,1.0,i had trouble with this item from day wont stay connected and always says i am having trouble understanding try again laterwhat a piece of crap tech support was not able to resolve my issue they were clueless i am sorry i wasted my time on this item i would not recommend it i also seen online that several people have the same issue and it appears that it has been a problem for quite some timetime to look at getting the google home
8738,3.0,camera in low light is not good compare to samsung on mobile that hurts cause it costs times to on as android phone user u cant download anything using browser that aint cool either it also hang sometimes
8739,3.0,whirlpool service is poor though the fridge is good price difference is also not much than market there at least service will be provided easily
8740,5.0,great value for money when compared to bigger brands like samsung
8741,1.0,not at all user friendly very slow apps not getting downloaded not able to transfer data from to other devices
8742,1.0,worst product nd service display nd touch screen stop working i want to connect with customer executive but they dont connect with customer executive
8743,4.0,i do a lot of online shopping and consequently a lot of returning when i saw this shirt online i was really excited about it it just looks very elegant nice and airy when the shirt arrived i almost thought that i should return it because there was blue lint all over the body and sleeves turns out that this is part of the shirt if you zoom in you can see the blue specs woven in i didnt end up returning the shirt because its extremely comfortable and i still get a lot of complimen
8744,5.0,got original iphone
8745,4.0,sound bass is really good but usb music should be upgraded where it will be more convenient than playing bluetooth through mobile phone
8746,2.0,i love my very old pilcro stet jeans they are the perfect denim weight and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide its a bummer
8747,2.0,the product is not as expected as from samsung when compared to other brands such as vivo oppo redmi and realme this mobile is not worthy for the cost i have purchased for this mobile when compared to other mobiles of cost rupees the specs and features are not in this mobile i am very disappointed with this product
8748,2.0,i would have bought it for but i bought it for saying it was lightning deal just rubbish
8749,1.0,worst product too slow in processing takes mins start time overall worst product ever
8750,5.0,the colors are so pretty a pinkish brown and a light brown trim it is very soft and elegant looking great with jeans or leggings the tie is a little high in back but looks great highly recommend
8751,3.0,this is very good hardware and speaker however very much handicapped by amazon on software front it can not understand your commands percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn however you can not use any of good music apps like wynk gaana youtube etc also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo for example when you say where is agra it gives you correct answer continue with next query like how to reach there then for nd query it doesnt know what to do this is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you amazon music has very limited music base so looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans
8752,2.0,for starters my hair is massive long and red imagine princess merida it is very dry and is quite coarse i was on the hunt for a good moisturizing shampoo to tame my mane and i had heard great things about the organix line i gave this shampoo a try because a friend recommended this to me and i liked the scent very beachy like a pina colada i gave it and the conditioner counterpart a try for a month and was not impressed at all it did not quotnourishquot like it claimed to left my hair oily and not clean at all and altogether it didnt live up to any of the claims it made i do not recommend this to anyone
8753,5.0,very good product if the product sold with flip cover it is good

8757,1.0,all are bad quality
8758,4.0,i bought this dress to wear to one of the upcoming events leading up to my wedding in mexico its the perfect mix of casual yet refined as another reviewer mentioned it is a bit tight through the bust but luckily i wasnt blessed in that area i would caution that there is absolutely no stretch to this dress its a true straight shift im going to rock it with turquoise and flats in mexico

8766,3.0,the remote is not working properly many times its just hangs and all the keys stops functioning i need a replacement
8767,5.0,wonderful dress thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me normally this sort of dress wouldnt fit with it failing me in the bust but it fit quite well in most cases i would endup in a petite to accommodate my bust but with it then too large in the shoulders or the dress would have run so small i wouldnt have been able to button it in most places i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit but the quality as well as described by other reviewers it
8768,3.0,this is really a cute top nice fabric the print the version i bought is lovely though the colors are different than pictured the problem for me is that i am b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking especially in the front it hit at hip level as in photo but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer looking at the other reviews i see that most of t
8769,5.0,love my echo dot i actually have purchased of them one for my daughter also i wish i could talk to anyone not just fellow echo dot people on it
8770,2.0,rear camera capturing pictures if not good in low light it creates red colour in whole picture
8771,2.0,ok so i bought this product because of all the reviews that i read here on muahowever i was not a big fan of it at allafter using it it made my hair soooooo tangled and dry feelingi had to go out and buy a deep conditioner just because of all the damage it did to my hairi have thick curly hair but its very soft so this took away my soft hair and i was not happy about that the only plus side to this shampoo was the scent it smells amazing but i think im going to use this as a shampoo to get rid of all the product build up once a month because thats what i felt it did it stripped everything off my hair haha maybe this would be better for someone with more oily hair
8772,2.0,speaker is not good why after using bluetooth reconnect its gives breaking noise
8773,3.0,everybody else is correct the dress is adorable but the fit is weird i am usually a size lb c but got the based on the reviews the waist fits perfect the top is huge especially the armholes if i get a size then the waist will be too tight however the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it definitely it has fit issues
8774,5.0,was using honor phones for the last years and i was very happy with the ui and built quality of huawei devices which prompted me to consider view above opt the phone is very good and camera is also one of the best out there very happy with the purchase
8775,4.0,i first got a damaged product it was immediately replaced after days good product though
8776,2.0,do not buy canon has tried to create monopoly through this model hot shoe has been changed so now only canon flash lights will work with this model ie canon eos d they have not even mentioned this anywhere on amazon or on their website not even the dealers of canon know this new development the lcd screen could have been given a flap covering which was in previous models
8777,3.0,i bought this shirt with the intentions of using it as a nursing top to that effect im happy with the purchase and will get a lot of use out of it i bought two on blush and one blue at the same time however i was surprised that the shirt was so open and loose i thought it was just a deep vneck but the design actually really opens up once the hook and eye is undone at the top you are then very exposed there is nothing but an opened front shirt this is convenient for a nursing mother
8778,2.0,this product is included with wall mount but when you unpack there is no sign of wall mount
8779,3.0,there is simply a ton of fabric on this tee i am a size on top with a fairly thin upper body but still an at retailer i often order small for swingy tees medium for more slimcut this tee in the small was huge the shoulders fit well but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length just odd especially for

8794,4.0,on papers configuration are very good after using for weeks gbgb here are my review performancedisplay is very good battery as expected good life but take around hrs to fulm charge with its fast charger camera quality is good however sometimes when you plan for group photo facesit is unable to capture with default pic mode its bad for group photo as msg come from camera unable to zoom so effectively when camera senes faces it actually get confused i was pressed button to click but it is giving msg unable to zoom mobile is fast good resolution big screen just like any other k phone its touch is good but sometimes its give us feeling that touch is ok ok not excellentnot as per my earlier phone oneplus overall good for this price
8795,5.0,this is an amazing booklots of knowledge we can gain from ithelpful for beginners
8796,2.0,ms got it and using since week the quality of wifi reception is too low security of this phone is useless id set all patterns and fingerprint but it opens just on a swipe samsung has played around with quality and software which totally waste looks good
8797,1.0,i hope you have better luck it has gotten a lot of great reviews but first the sticker covering the contacts on the back fell off then the card died completely hopefully its an isolated incident but im trying a different brand in case its a bad batch
8798,3.0,i purchased the grey in a medium i normally wear an or in tops c i found it to fit quite well but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy so if you have a longer torsolike me you may not be the happiest i loved the lace and didnt have an issue with that area being sheer but the nonlace part is very thin i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around you could even see the width of th
8799,3.0,have used this phone and also tested the same in many areas overall built quality is nice but it is kinda plastici finish enough loud in speaker and it is also good in headphones phone is fast due to processor even it may be due to brand new product and not that heavily used overall performance is very nice and impressive but i felt little heating if used heavily multitasked but heating is not that major to worry about camera quality is decent in the price range i would say not that impressed but still it fetches decent photographs in bright sunlightbut it struggles in low light in comparison with realme this phone has lot to improve in camera processing department but you should not expect too much in this price range battery performance is very decent and it will last you whole day but it is very slow in charging as for me it took roughly hrs to charge from zero to but overall phone is worth buying
8800,5.0,in this budget its a master piece you dont have to go for any other just go for it
8801,3.0,hangs terribly off the chest tentlike looks maternity no thanks
8802,5.0,very good products
8803,5.0,timely delivery from amazon and good service from samsung
8804,2.0,this dress makes me so sadthe textured stretchy fabric color length and overall swingy fit are spot on as another reviewer noted though the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress the neck is tiny which i could have gotten over once it was on but the arm holes were just awful too big all around too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut basically you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes it could have been so good but alas but t
8805,2.0,i was so excited to wear this shirt even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot and i found that the same thing happened to me it also clings tightly to the body i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders
8806,2.0,its not good
8807,4.0,this duster is very nicely put together and is midweight im not sure its worth this price point but its not cheaply made either the colors are as shown on the website to a t the length is also as shown i am lbs and d and the small is perfect i think if one is considering multiple layers underneath a medium would serve the purpose nicely but the small will accommodate a blouse or tee underneath and is just perfect colors are dark teal salmon and gold this is a three seaso
8808,4.0,ive been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a week now it leaves my hair shiny and soft more so than some quotshinequot shampoos ive tried the smell is amazing for some reason it reminds me of christmas the scent sticks around too after blowdrying and curling with a flat iron it was still very noticeable i will definitely buy this again
8809,1.0,the worst shampoo i think ive used in the past couple of years i picked this up at costco because i wanted a sulfate free shampoo that would last me a while i decided on this because hey coconut smells nice this did nothing except ruin my hair its really thick and while it builds a nice lather it doesnt really clean my hair my hair feels thick and sludgy hard to comb through and feels like it has a film on it that makes it feel sticky it also makes my curls totally flat dry and frizzy also the smell is so strong it stays in my hair for days and i cant stand it it honestly has no redeeming qualities ill never use this stuff again
8810,4.0,ordered this is the navy in a size mim lbs d it was huge it is also very billowy but im going to try it in a petite s i also changed colors to the ivory as the navy was really plain hoping this size change works
8811,1.0,amazon call back the package would give star
8812,3.0,received power bank is not able to charge note pro twice fully not satisfied with the product ideally if its mah then it should at least provide full charge for note pro which has mah battery
8813,4.0,i purchased this top in the wine color and found it to be cute and comfortable the sleeves are not tight which is nice but it is very short and moving your arms away from our sides make this shirt look a little bit like a tent the color is pretty and the button detail is nice overall good purchase but im glad i got it on sale
8814,4.0,awesome with low price
8815,3.0,i loved the look of this top when i saw it online however when i received it i was kinda disappointed the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially its way more off white not my favorite the texturepattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful but not enough for me to keep unfortunately i will be returning this one not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love
8816,1.0,i ordered this in both an extra small and a small i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes the extra small was true to size and had a great width but was shorter in length than i wouldve liked if it shrunk at all it wouldve been unwearable the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked but i decided to keep that one the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
8817,1.0,dont buy it its not work properly i dont know where is the customer care how can i repair it
8818,5.0,whats not to love about alexa helping with whatever you need i mostly use it connected to my bluetooth speaker for music and it is amazing
8819,1.0,voice
8820,2.0,didnt meet the expectation the battery charges pretty quick but drains out quickly too phone hangs every now and then just not happy with the product
8821,2.0,this conditioner is bad the smell is fantastic and does leave your hair smelling great all day after i rinse it out my hair feels dry and tangly even though i run a wide tooth comb through my hair with the conditioner in it my hair does not tangle easily so for this to occur i know the conditioner must be bad i may try mixing it with another conditioner based on other reviews just for the scent
8822,5.0,screen and touch are great feel like the bezels are unnecessarily big could have been a bit thinner the power button underneath is super annoying but definitely worth it
8823,3.0,beautifulwell made topit just runs small not for me
8824,1.0,this was horrible its so thick that its almost impossible to get out of the bottle my hair is about half way down my back and i used a nickle sized drop just to put on my ends and it made my hair feel weighed down and greasy it smells good but thats about it i would never buy this again and i plan on going and returning the remaining product today
8825,4.0,good production
8826,5.0,i love this top in fact if it came in more colors id buy a few more its just so soft and comfortable wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights the neckline is perfect love the subtle details it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath yes i love it just wish there were more colors
8827,5.0,this was installed in my s i had no issues like others have posted in fact i formatted in the computer and popped it right in
8828,1.0,not good for charging very show charging
8829,2.0,these jeans are adorable im so sad they didnt fit my legs are bigger than the rest of my body but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants if you are looking for wide legs these are not the jeans for you
8830,3.0,this dress fit perfectly i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well i do however think that the dress is over priced for as often as you would wear this dress given that isnt a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once i think the price is way too high a must have on sale or clearance but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination we will see t
8831,4.0,got this on sale in three colors love the look of the blouses great for work only con is that the sides are shorter than i would like

8836,3.0,pro display is very good awsome os is friendly performance is as of now good for average usage a very well try from samsung but needs a whole lot of improvement if they want to dominate the mid range segment cons camera totally wasted if u love mobile photography plz dont buy this phone heating issue during photography and gaming gpu is not upto the mark as compared to adreno series build quality dose not feel like a mid range premium phone chinese makers are far ahead in this or below this price range hd fon audio op and normal speaker op has been compromised gaming experience is poor as compared to sd processors within this price range the battery backup has been over hyped some one in the name of samsung india here in amazon qa section was claiming the front glass was cg but latter found it is dragon tail glass nowhere in the competition amazon plz take care of this matter dont fool the customers verdict go for any chinese manufacturers within this price range having sd cheapest best regards
8837,5.0,accurate face detection less sar value comfortable screen and easy access speed wise no compromise and lookwise it is a great deal
8838,3.0,i bought this in with varient overall phone is good but according to the price it is not a best phone you can go with another phone in this price range and got best mobile
8839,4.0,received opened product box sealed box alreday opened already and sealed again i have taken photo before opening product box product is good but not sure it is alreday used or not
8840,4.0,even the website had this card in the picture of what id be ordering when i got a plain black sandisk card i was a bit concernes and peeved sonsidering i bought the big one turns out android hate class cards and much more prefers class cards because of the way the os accesses lots of files at once and class timing is just better for their computations only the star off because of my own expectationsotherwise this is gonna make a great camera card hopefully the pics take faster its certainly a size upgrade atleast
8841,3.0,i wanted to love this skirt i love highwaisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model it was not so flattering on me the fabric is so lovelytruly the photos online dont do it justice its heavy and luxurious wonderful for fall or winter and the gold gray and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold plus pockets however the midi length did not work for me despite the products suggestion that it was a universally flattering length just above the knee im not
8842,2.0,this top is has an awkward neckline doesnt lay like the photo as mentioned by another reviewer see threw and of poor quality the fit is very baggy and unflattering and material is very thin it also runs very large the color is pretty but that is it
8843,3.0,nice product but radiation is more i got this for rupees for exchange of two thousand extra and bank offer camera quality and display is good miui is not much good charging the battery is quickbut heating issue is there best mobile for price strongly recommending to all suggested price k
8844,2.0,such a cute skirt but impossible to get on ordered in an xs i have a waist but could barely get it past my knees to step into if you have any hips at all unfortunately this skirt wont work i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small
8845,1.0,the packaging was fine the price was very reasonable but the product did nothing for me no wait a minute it did do something it made my moderately short hair a tangled mess the wide toothed comb did not glide through my wet hair but snagged all over my head i do not see any effects with curbing the frizzes i will probably use it up but i will definitely not repurchase i have been seduced by a number of organix products but i have failed to find one that lived up to its promises very ordinary drugstore products there are much much better drugstore hair products out there
8846,4.0,osam camerarear and front both cameras r more than expectationbattery is gudoveralla osam mobile in dis rangeguys go for it
8847,4.0,this vest is a really cute idea for layering so i ordered my usual size medium and while it fit it just added about pounds onto my frame ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down but it just made me look so bulky sizing down wouldnt have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small its a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too im and usually wear a or
8848,4.0,does what is claimed to do small and easily placed sound is tinny for music
8849,5.0,i loved this jacket the minute i saw it saturday sunday is one of my favorite brands even cuter on than the photo short back at natural waist long in front great quality fabric thick and warm fits very narrow in sleeves so i went from small to medium to have room for a top underneath the medium is perfect back is stylish solid tweed grey with front pattern wrapped around from front sleeves and collar a black diamond pattern and ribbon trimmed edgeoverall very interesting grey black c
8850,4.0,like the product
8851,3.0,i purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers while the cut is fine the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very seethrough will be returning it
8852,4.0,great fabric not too clingy and provides a forgiving sillhoette very comfortable perfect skirt for summer get togethers or shopping may be a little long if you are on the short side one thing i liked is that the skirt draped well and doesnt hang open or slide up recommend particularly on sale
8853,1.0,i got the handset delivered today and when i connected my phone to wifi a software update notification came and i updated but after update the phone in still frozen in boot screen android one i dont know what to do im trying hard reset but it doesnt work
8854,5.0,quick and easyapple is best
8855,3.0,worst for bass loveri hatedbut good for sound qualitycould be dangerous for ears i guess
8856,5.0,lots of fun also lots of facts you will never be lonely with an echo dot
8857,3.0,power bank phone charging capacity very low
8858,2.0,i ordered the xl in white for fit its true to size it matches the models photos its a comfortable top the shape is good with the pleating but the color is definitely off its as if the white fabric was prewashed with navy its not the fresh crisp white shown at least for the one i received the quality of the material is basic the black version might be the better one overall im going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try overall i dont think its worth ful
8859,3.0,product was same as the previous fire stick with a new remote but a really poor remote quality when compared to the previous generation looks like local china plastic product previous generationsremote was made of high quality plastic and the back cover is also bit loose
8860,4.0,i brought this in primeday offer after replacing my old laptop i got it in very low price which was never expected worth for price but they mentioned as it has fingerprint scanner im not able to find anywhere in the laptop hp should increase ram capacity and hdd capacity which will be more helpful
8861,5.0,this is a best phone from samsung actually it has packed with high end performance battery life and display quality display looks stunning super amoled display done an great job viewing angle is superb performance wise it does a nice job while playing high end gameslike pubg it works well but in some places i found little bit laggy like during calls and sms from network fingerprint works fine but there is a small lag in it may be in update they will rectify it camera is quite decent especially wide angle lens works nice live focus slow motion is also very nice super steady mode works really well really amazed with this feature when talking about battery only mah is for paper but for practical scenario it wont last more than day for average use but battery back up is good overall killer phone samsungms
8862,2.0,it says mah but not able to charge my phone with mah atleast for times planning to return it
8863,2.0,i love the look of this dress on model but sadly fit didnt work out very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes im c reliably a size this dress seemed at least sizes off for me my daughter usually a size could wear it except for the arm hole size and the fact that its dollars and shes going back btw novelty print means ice cream novelty little popsicles with bites taken out cute but more juvenile than i expected
8864,3.0,i have used almost months cable cutted at edge due to improper maintenance over all good if the cable quality is more it will be added advantage
8865,3.0,battery is worst maximum days backup on minimum uses
8866,1.0,after the first purchase i got a replacement as the bluetooth of the product was not working the replacement also had problem as the app could not locate the band finally had to go for a return and refund
8867,1.0,despite the class rating this card has much slower write speeds than some others and there are numerous examples online of it not being fast enough to work with the high resolution video from the gopro hero black edition if youre using that camera choose one of the cards recommended on their site
8868,2.0,i wanted to love this top but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the grey that you order is much much lighter grey in addition this shirt is super boxy thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in going back disappointed
8869,2.0,i wanted to like this dress but it just did not work for a bustier frame the fabric is quite loose does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy so if you are wellendowed your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs as a result the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips as on the model and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward on smaller curves this would likely be very flattering but
8870,2.0,i have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color these are less flattering and i may not keep them
8871,2.0,the software is not good as expected and the phone works slowly even for small tasks and lags are appeared frequentlyinstead samsung is lot better of mi
8872,1.0,bought samsung m gg in september month end sale in just the phone is bigger in size and heavy due to high capacity battery mah but battery backup is good camera is worst quality which has been a problem with samsung phones always overall if you love taking picturesselfies than its not going to be a good phone for you
8873,4.0,i bought this for my sons birthday and i think he is enjoying it my grandson tells his dad more dad more lol
8874,2.0,the only thing you must be happy about is finger print reader and battery everything else is not good especially phone is getting stuck i have not installed much apps but still phone is hanging
8875,4.0,its cute it works with jeans linen pants flip flops but i wouldnt say it is a must have but im keeping it because it works
8876,3.0,as the other reviewer said this top is pretty short nice design but i wish it was a little longer and i am short i tried on xxs regular xs petite and xs regular xxs was closest to flattering around the top part shoulders cehst but stil la bit short the petite was jsut too short and xs regular a bit longer but a little loose os hte fit jsut ddindt work i may wait for sale on this but probably something beter wil lcome along great for those who want to show their assets
8877,4.0,fast no problems i loved the price and it worked immediately never caused me any problems oh just remembered when i place it into the sd card to make it fit into the pc usually the micro sd get stuck in the holder that i did not like
8878,3.0,well start with the positives the smell is great i do like that the split ends seemed to be a little bit more mended when i started using it however after a few weeks of news nothing else changed and the split ends seemed to be getting worse instead of better in fact my hair started to feel coated and gross i finally tossed it and started to use tresemme in place of the organix and it works a lot better its strange because ive used all sorts of products and my hair has never felt so coated as it did with this one smells great but the products not worthwhile if it doesnt work
8879,1.0,this thing is overrated we dont use it at all
8880,1.0,i would like to return this product due to low quality
8881,1.0,not useful for rough and tough use phone getting heat soon even there is no back ground running apps
8882,4.0,rear camera quality is not as good as the front one should have supported usb type c
8883,5.0,this works as expected and is wayyyy faster than my gig class cardmy old card would slow down my phone as it was close to being full and would take forever to load up everything music files pictures etc this card however ive loaded more than gb of stuff on there put everything from my old card and more it reads and loads up fine no need to wait buy this card
8884,3.0,the battery life is good build quality is okay power button is slightly squeaky the screen gets scratched very easily the build quality of my iphone s was better it fell more than dozen times and still standing strong and intact camera isnt much of an upgrade from s except for front camera night photography is not good screen is big and wide good for videos and reading got it for k for gb on amazon great deal sound quality is lcd screen is better for my eyes than led i can feel the difference verdict if you cant afford xs and xs max and want a new iphone then this is a good phone
8885,3.0,i purchased this dress online and it just didnt fit my body very well it also arrived with a pretty sizeable hole so i cant say that im impressed with the quality there were other areas too where was a loose thread which im sure will develop into another hole eventually returned
8886,2.0,it has dual rear camera but it doesnt seems like because pics are seem to be oil painted and pic quality degrades badly when its zoomed nor its front camera is worth as its mp but the pic clicked from it seems like clicked from mp camera except camera other quality and features are good
8887,5.0,i wear this top all the time perfect with jeans and cant wait to wear with a skirt in the summer i am and have the xs which hits in a great length just as pictured i bought at full price so for the sale price you are getting a great deal
8888,1.0,bad product and bad service by amazon
8889,1.0,camera quality down finger id not work properly
8890,2.0,this dress had an odd fit very loose on top with pointy darts very tight on bottom fabric was stiff so it didnt move well with me
8891,4.0,good storage sd card
8892,3.0,i ordered this in both the white and navy colors navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots when i received the blouse the background on the navy is actually a light greybeige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy when ordering the navy version be aware that the product images dont show the true background color on the top
8893,3.0,this is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder i guess the material was a little too thin is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily
8894,5.0,this comes with an excellent camera and a huge battery which lasts even with heavy usage the finger print reader is awesome and picture clarity is fabulous worth every rupee
8895,3.0,selfie camera is too badhigh white balance back cam is notmp
8896,1.0,waste of money cast screen not working samsung smartphones only support mi devices
8897,4.0,cute dress runs small especially in the sleeves and chest i usually wear a and purchased a the outer layer is very sheer and while the print and shape are cute the quality could be better especially for the price
8898,4.0,fingerprint scanner is well good enough but it can be fast hope some update would come in near future
8899,5.0,camera quality is not soo good
8900,4.0,this is a very sexy suit it took some time to figure out how to put it on it needs instructions but it is well worth it
8901,1.0,i wanted to like this one really but it was just plain sloppy looking i returned it
8902,1.0,this shampoo smells delicious and thats about it half way thru this shampoo i noticed that it had dried my hair out like straw and my hair was also shedding like crazy too bad because it made my hair very shiny and healthy looking for a couple of weeks my husband tried it and it had the same effect on his hair edit found out what makes my loose hair like crazy with this shampoo seems this third ingredient is the culprit water sodium c olefin sulfonate cocamidopropyl betaine
8903,5.0,value for moneyvery nice phonehas v good sound quality but strucks sometimes and we have to refresh iti wont say camera quality is so goodits just okaybut overall the phone is nice
8904,2.0,not a good product very slow and hanging issues instead of gb ram and intel core i gen dont buy
8905,1.0,cute sweater snap was broken when i received it and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock ugh
8906,3.0,the problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly the only elastic should be right at the shoulders the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem
8907,5.0,a great book to increase your vocab plus speaking skills
8908,2.0,very nice fabric and quality but runs very large i had to return my pair of a size stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture
8909,3.0,smart features for search can be improved by using laser guided typing search feature can be improved
8910,1.0,product is not good many times sounds are whisperin sound quality is poor
8911,3.0,i find this card seems to frequently stop working altogether and have to be reformatted or simply reseated its hard to know if this is the fault of the device i use it in a cellphone or the card itself so i cant really hold that against it but all i can say is thats been my experience with this card and not others
8912,2.0,this tunic only barely resembles the photo in person first the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photos second its huge im and typically wear or p in retailerpolgies shirtsdresses i ordered the sp and the dress was at least times wider than it needed to be it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless and the style doesnt really lend itself to use with a belt
8913,5.0,super flattering my mom and i both bought this and we have very different body types we both had to size up a bit as i have a large chest and she has a large ribcage i got a size im normally a size and she got a it was much easier to zip up without bras on and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra my mom is pretty short so shes going to get her straps shortened for reference im about hope this helps
8914,3.0,fingerprint scanner not working goodif unable to face recognition not ok fingerprint scanner not working after pressing power on button then scanner works
8915,3.0,this is a flattering comfortable soft sweater the instant you put it on a few instants after that however i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity im not optimistic about its longevity and wouldnt recommend it except for the extravagant singleuse buyer
8916,2.0,sound quality not much good didnt matched with my expectations
8917,4.0,review for sandisk ultra gb microsdxc class uhs memory card with adapter sdsdqugaffpathis product arrived via usps its not in any individual packing from the manufacturer it was placed in an sd case together with the adapter so i am unable to verify warranties or authenticity the samsung s recognized and formatted this with no problem it sees it as an external memory with gb the six gb is probably allocated for fatfile allocation table will order again from this seller
8918,4.0,the redmi pro works well with casual usage face recognition is quick and it doesnt heat up good device for watching videos cons weak low light camera performance
8919,3.0,camera is the worst part of this device in artificial light it work as a mp camera when i uploaded a video from this device to youtube you will be amazed that youtube algorithm took this video as p it is that bad performance in day to day work is ok but for gaming its a biggggggg noooooo nooooo heats too much you can buy much better phone at this price battery is excellent ps do not listen to online reviews they are fake out of video only or telling you the complete truth
8920,4.0,i find that this brand can be a little bit allovertheplace with sizes had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well i bought a m in another shirt from them the seamed scoop neck and that shirt was a full inches smaller in the bust than this just something to keep in mind still a great shirt love the neutral color
8921,1.0,phone is not as expected display is not good phone is slow when i bought it i was expecting lot as mi has shown in add camera is worst good thing is stock android the only thing i like it amazon technician visited my place and found the camera problem i requested amazon to return this phone and would like to go with different phone my expectation was different with this phone amazon didnt return it they just replaced it and i am not satisfied with this purchase amazon did to me when i am a almost years old customer of amazon i told that i dont want money keep it in my account and i would like to go with different phone as this phone is not as i was expected amazon customer executive didnt find a way to help instead of that they just said this is what we can do only replace with same phone still camera is not doing fingerprint is slow phone is slow but i am not going to complain again becoz they may check found the issue they will just replace which doesnt make any sense request to buyers please read the policy carefully when you bye anything from amazon i am customer of amazon from us and was having the same mind set that if you didnt like thing you can return and get the right one which you like but this is not same in india so be careful we may need to check physically in store before buying it online as you may stick with these policies and stuck with the things which you dont like

8924,2.0,very dissapointed many people that use this notice that their hair is softer after using it well sure thats true but it doesnt resolve the problem isnt this for curing split ends not for curing dry hair so this did not take away my split ends but it did make my hair softer for about a week now my hair is reeeally frizzy at the ends and hard to manage i hate this product with a passion it was not even worth the or dollars i spent
8925,2.0,this jacket has cute details i like the front pockets and color it has no shape and is about size bigger than marked i felt like a sack of potatoes in it

8931,2.0,performance and looks are ultimate but the bad battery and no fingerprint sucks at this price range
8932,5.0,have several of these for my video devices and they work great sandisk is a great product and have never had one fail in over years great price too
8933,1.0,its not charging mobile automatically one usb port is not working other port power output is very very low

8936,5.0,worth reading
8937,2.0,delivery is to bad and chrome cast not supported
8938,1.0,battery missed in this product
8939,5.0,this blouse is just so beautiful but i do love white blouses so that may influence my enthusiasm however once i buttoned it up it was just dreamy i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs so its often hard to find something thats the right length this is perfect it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height but its a rare find for me paired with a pair of cropped pants because id come in a dress it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways im sti
8940,5.0,the fabric on this top is just so soft its a thin cotton knit and drapes beautifully the top runs tts butit is tailored to the body its not loose and wide in the width the length hits the top of the hips just as shown this works for casual or dress for dress i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is btw i bought this in black which is why adding the pin glams it up although i bought it in black its not sheer so a cami isnt needed
8941,4.0,nice product budjet phone
8942,1.0,this doe not connect no matter what i have looked at helped and also called horrible service and device
8943,4.0,when i first pulled this shirt from the box i thought it was a for sure winner the beading was stunning it was just so elegant and the details are perfection till i tried it on and had some reservations the sleeves at the top were very poofy and just would not lay in a flattering way unless they were rolled above my elbow to tighten them and as a taller gal i wish it were a tad longer in the model shot looks a bit short from the back view i fear tucking it would loosen the bead work
8944,2.0,so disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days especially at this price point the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful but i will never spend two hundred dollars or even half that on a poly dress please add more linen cotton and silk
8945,1.0,smells good but not good to my hair this was not nearly conditioning enough and my hair was very tangled and stringy looking it also didnt appear very clean after washing with this i do love the tea tree line but only the scent as it does nothing for my hair either
8946,5.0,very very nicegreat value for money
8947,4.0,is ok not bad
8948,2.0,i bought two of these memory cards for use with my logitech alert e outdoor master security cameras so far i have found them to be unreliable i am not entirely certain if this is because of the camera system or the memory card themselves the camera frequently will report a memory card error that indicates the card has to be reformatted this is problematic as if the camera had recorded something that was important the failure of the sd card would be very troublesome indeed
8949,5.0,this dress is everything i love about retailer a nevercouldhaveguessedit feminine textured twist on a classic its beautiful its comfortable the cut is true to size for me and figure flattering
8950,3.0,bad
8951,1.0,the first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides it is terribly quality and gets worse with every wear and wash possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item ive ever seen like the design and fit immediately relegated it to a weekendhome shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so cant be shaved off
8952,2.0,fullfileed not box as there describe in product
8953,4.0,camera quality not upto the mark
8954,4.0,this is my second dot we use them daily for a lot of tasks timer alarm shopping list phone numbers weather and news this is bluetooth coupled to a logitech bluetooth device to my stereo receiver we can listen to music while getting ready in the morning or whenver in the bedroomonly issue is i have difficulty uncoupling from blue tooth when i turn the stereo off and it will not play through the internal speaker also note that the ability to discern my foice is limited when there is music or news on the system my friends have the echo and it seems much better at hearing them even when other sounds playingexcept for the fact that i feel big brother is always listening we really enjoy our dot
8955,3.0,overall performance is good there is some delay observed while loading images or videos data exchange speed is not upto the specified rate

8957,5.0,bought it as a prime member on the day it was launched and it after almost a month of usage i reckon it was a brilliant decision unbelievable battery easily lasting for a day and half on moderate usage continuously connected to wifi camera take stellar quality pictures and the ultra wide lens is just the thing i wanted and at this price that was my primary reason to go for this handset screen resolution is decent at this price range overall touch and feel of the phone makes it premium quality
8958,2.0,i ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it the color was just as pretty in person the thick eyelet panel was well done the problem is the whole tank was much smallertighter than pictured i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit im pearshaped so the hip area looked terrible but the whole top just wasnt up to the typical fitting standards for xl retailer has done much better in the pas
8959,4.0,good productvery handyslimbut slightly hot feeling at the backside of the phone after usingmobile data on minaverage battery life overall
8960,3.0,not a great product
8961,1.0,doesnt work
8962,2.0,not happy with performance battery is drained by hours only even i had order one year additional warranty which i havent received yet
8963,4.0,good battery life notifications about calls and messages very useful but unable see display in sunlight
8964,5.0,obviously this product from descendants of mr steve jobs is pure value for money i would always recommend to go for this unless you are planning to go for an android device and yess be ready to spend some more on other connectivity accessories and its truly said with great power comes great responsibility
8965,1.0,sucks
8966,2.0,cmon the accent is wrong a simple google search would prevent this
8967,5.0,i adore this dress the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look the bottom hem is this super cute fringe so fun and feminine and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric this dress
8968,3.0,finger print was good camera was zoom not picbettry is one day life hr
8969,3.0,good product at an affordable price bad delivery from amazon the seller took week time for a metro city like chennai
8970,3.0,could have made it more compact and handy battery life is not up to the mark
8971,3.0,i really wanted these jeans to work but i am too curvy and not tall enough for them i just felt like they were swallowing me up with fabric i am and had a stacked boot heel on when i tried them on and they were still too long i felt like they made me look even bigger than i am the fabric is nice not as dark as the photo as others have said
8972,5.0,as in super comfortable and a joy to wear i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on the moment i put it on i knew it was for me i missed out on getting it in the other color i hope you get more in other colors
8973,4.0,thank you mr robin sharma for publishing such a good book for us i would call the book as philosophy of good living life really every chapter of this book is a new way of living after completing this book i will read the secret letters of the monk who sold his ferrari you are the second person after mr sandeep maheshwari who is teaching me how to live to the fullest dip
8974,2.0,not as expected the phone get heated up while charging
8975,1.0,i would give this negative stars it is beyond sleazy that the product arrives allowing unregulated shopping your five year old will buy some random stuff sign you up for services like amazon prime and then you and your husband will yell at each other about it i have threatened to throw it against the wall this is one of the few products that has caused us marital problems and amazons policy about making it nearly impossible to get a person on the phone does not help this product makes me want to ban amazon from my home altogether
8976,5.0,very much satisfied with the tv
8977,1.0,reviewtextreadmorev dataenableyoutubepreviewtrue dataproductid datareviewid datatexti tried this product some time last year after reading reviews and watching many youtube videos i followed their advice of not oversaturating the hair and really i only used like a quarter of the bottle but my hair felt really greasy but it was super straight i waited the days to wash it and after i did it was back to its very curly state i thought it was a total waste of money well last month i decided to give it another try after getting more tips on applying similar treatments this time i made sure to comb through with a fine toothed comb to get the excess product off and evenly distribute it i did everything else and wow i loved the results my hair had been bleached completely and i wanted something to coat it and make it shiny again and of course i wanted it to be soft again this really helped improve the feel of my hair and it did loosen up alot of my curls i think the first application can be a bit difficult but once you get the hang of it you can actually get really good results update this stuff really ruined my curls when i wrote this review maybe a week or had passed since application at first i thought wow it really works well i didnt realize just how much this was going to change my hairafter about a week i didnt want to be straightening my hair because obviously all that heat would damage my hair further the problem was that after washing my hair i noticed that the top inches of my hair was very frizzy not curly kind of wavy then the bottom part was straight i could not go out like that before i could wash and go now my hair was in a weird state of not curly not all the way straight just frizzy and ugly i wore my hair mostly in a bun or braids because it was so ugly not even shiny so ok after doing this a second time i retouched this a few weeks later cause i still had a little product left and i figured well its not curly and i cant get my curls the way they were so maybe i can just get it to be evenbad idea to this date my hair is in recovery i soooo miss my curls they are slowly coming back but i totally regret doing this to my hair the only good thing is that i really learned to love what i had and i will not do this to my hair ever again if you love your curls do not do this i have had the coppola treatments and i loved them because i could have both the curly and the straight not with this i would not reccomend thisi tried this product some time last year after reading reviews and watching many youtube videos i followed their advice of not oversaturating the hair and really i only used like a quarter of thediv
8978,3.0,this is a wellmade top and looks very pretty in the pictures but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy but unfortunately it didnt work for me i wear a c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else so perhaps this works better for the smaller chested additionally and this wasnt so much of a con and just something to note the fabric is pretty seethrough it works for the
8979,4.0,phone is okay but very bad ram managementapps get killed randomly miui is root of problem but rest is fine
8980,2.0,battery is not good back up is less than hrs and it is only months old

8987,2.0,very thin and small its only showing notification not contact name or numbers disappointed steps r not accurate only thing its looking attractive
8988,5.0,very impressive phone under k price pros highly customisable ui very smooth coloros which gives an impression of ios very good display crisp and clear screen best viewed hd content on this display features like split screen kids space allow to run a list apps for kids for specified time themes to change the look of ui soft keys or swipe gesture like iphone x for ui face unlock and finger print unlock is very fast and the list goes on and on very good camera performance it capture best in day light and does decent job in night options like portrait bokeh time lapse slomo etc are as good as high end phones battery is very good and battery related optimisations are in built with os which gives lot of option to make battery life last longer mediatek processor is very good for games and other graphic content apps lte connectivity is good could have been better with qualcomm processor but still existing chip does good job its a phone for every age ui can be customised as per your taste android upgrade is available through software update cons wifi is only ghz there is no ghz available i mean its not dual band wifi thats it nothing else if you are looking for sub k phone no more confusion this is the best phone out there
8989,4.0,sound quality is pretty awesome and designe is also elegant with charming black decent look and very lighy weight but need to work to get fitted in ear like earpods overall my experience is amzing with this ewrphone a would saya worth for money
8990,2.0,i bought two of these after my echo was stolen one quit working last month and it is too late to return really upsets me
8991,5.0,awsome seller awsome price awsome product am fully satisfied
8992,5.0,great product i hope they make a wireless version
8993,5.0,once again retailer delivers a beautiful quality dress i love it it is comfortable and flattering the material is lightweight enough that i will be able to wear into spring
8994,3.0,everything is good bt i think battery life is not as like as mah drained in one day even in normal use charging time is also very high it takes almost hour for fully chargecamera is also average only sound and picture quality is good
8995,4.0,its an sd card this ones fast the read and write speeds are pretty equal on this one approaching mbits per second for read and write i installed linux to this drive for my cubieboard yeah read and write speed would definitely be an ultimate determiner of over all system performance with this credit card sized computersandisk makes nice stuff dont they
8996,5.0,love this jacket the sleeves are a little bigloose but its not quite as flattering as it could be but its so comfy its worth it great quality
8997,5.0,i ordered this product on tuesday and it arrived on wednesday got it with emi no extra charge the picture quality is great full hd for the price it sure does have really great features youtube amazon prime hotstar etc in market smart tv comes at atleast above k it was the reason why i got this first thing the packaging was good the delivery person opened it showed the physical status the bad thing is kevin does not give you a call within hour which they should i had to set up the tv all by myself they gave call the next day and the installation engineer gave a call two days later if you are not a tech savy figuring out features of the can be very difficult even the manual does not match the tv settings completely cant watch netflix it keeps showing a error message i am yet to figure out hotstar typing and handling the mouse on tv is very difficult with the remote get a air remote will cost you more than k if you do not have a hdmi cord buy that as well to watch tv through your set top box miracast is supported you can cast your phone to the screen with wifi however you cant watch netflix through it settings like brightness and colour are difficult to figure out in all its a good product but not the best however worth the money
8998,2.0,the delivery was on time and phone works fine but the voice on call is too low i cant hear the other person clearly too disappointed with the voice calls
8999,3.0,camera quality is not good if you are looking for good camera then dont go for this phone display i expected to be very good but i am disappointed with its display quality some issue with proximity sensor you can google it on this i havent played any high end games on this so cant comment on speed performance overall its an average phone not the best phone if you need just smart phone with good memory and battery then go for it else you have many other options
9000,3.0,i need tshirts these seem cute a small runs loose but its comfortable and it does fit i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brands printed tees if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist because these shirts are cut generously the little slits just throw the whole look off i tried a few in the store but left them all there
9001,1.0,please dont buy this product there are many issues with it youtube isnt upgradable in this tv but it asks to install however there is no option to skip it so we cannot use this app ive complained to the customer support a week back and they said they are aware of the issue and will fix in hrs but its been a hrs and there is no fix so please dont go for this kind of products and waste your money go for some standard tvs like mi micromax lg etc
9002,2.0,i would have kept this dress if it werent for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides other than that it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice substantial material
9003,2.0,first off the brand name is misleading this is just as quotorganicquot as every other shampoo out there that has fruit of some sort as an ingredient so basically all of them its still loaded with sulfates and alcohols so if youre looking for a more natural product this isnt it i was given this awhile back along with the shampoo and i gave it a few months since hair needs time to adjust to new products and i figured this might work better after a few weeks like other products ive tried instead its just been worse and worse since i started using it its to the point now where combing my short not even chinlength hair is a painful timeconsuming process and it feels rough and a little frizzy afterwards that being said it does moisturize my hair without making it oily which is nice for combination hair like mine sadly i wont be rebuying since the benefits arent worth ripping out chunks of hair every time i wash and brush it
9004,1.0,mainly earphone pin is not connected to mobile earphone pin buy after few month
9005,2.0,paper quality is poor
9006,3.0,soundlink mini is a great portable speaker if you are looking for something to be used at homeyou would definitely not want to take it out on long tours because with one drop they could get messed upso if you like to keep your music at home it would surely give a blast but if you like to travell alot and you want somethin duriable you should go for ue soundboom
9007,1.0,battery health is very poor
9008,5.0,good product but video quality is little disappointed to me
9009,3.0,this spandex top in my opinion is workout wear it is not the tank i expected to receive but my bad it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is it should fit like this lbs medium is skin tight color is nice but as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisionedit has to go back to retailer quality seems fair

9015,3.0,i so wanted to love this dress despite the reviews when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric even though i absolutely loved the fabric the flowing overlay was just too much i am returning it
9016,3.0,i agree with the other two reviews it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isnt lined the fabric is paper thin this is an aline style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy i sized down to a petite xs i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size
9017,1.0,worst iam not able to use prime tv via app or casting aswell please do not consider this if you are an prime lover like me
9018,1.0,worst product not working in first boot
9019,2.0,the skiers cats and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns unfortunately the fit was awful i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite the skier fabric is also seethrough the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in but it is not very long rayon fabric is a bummer too the shirt was snug at the bicep but not as bad as i expected from the reviews i sized up from an to
9020,1.0,i gave this as a gift and by the time we noticed the issue the return date had passed weve been a longtime echo owneruser without issue this dot is a piece of junk you have to yell at it to get it to hear anything even when the room is quiet perhaps i have a defective device but well never know since i cant return it it is almost useless as is since you have to walk up to it so it can hear you

9024,3.0,the models pose and description are misleading this top has absolutely no shape to it the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture plain black the back print is nicejust more faded than shown in picture the entire design has no form it is huge also cheaply made
9025,1.0,very slowly working
9026,4.0,pretty top quality material it is not thin and see through size down because this runs large although it is meant to be flowy if you dont size down the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering
9027,3.0,ive only used this a couple times and while its not the best ive used its not terrible i like that it doesnt leave any buildup i cant stand conditioners that leave buildup i dont like having to rinse for minutes just to get it all out only to find patches where theres still bits of product this one feels like it actually sinks into my hair and rinses out very cleanly it smells amazingvery similar to tbs satsuma and the smell lingers i always use a separate leavein product so the fact that its not ubermoisturizing is ok with me
9028,1.0,i was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago i got my usual size and could not button it up for the life of me i get it im busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky however the arms were impossibly tight my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves
9029,2.0,i had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings im so i got the ml to ensure length maybe that was wrong if the laid flat width was included maybe that would have been more helpful but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack the side slits of course hidden in the photos came up to just over my natural waist enhancing that effect i loved the

9037,3.0,the battery life is decent you can live with it every thing is ok but there is a problem with multi touch when you play pubg you will notice ghost touch and sometime the touch is not working at all when the device gets hot the touch response use to behave abnormally and the performance of this phone is not good at all dont know why even after having snapdragon i will suggest this phone if only your priority is camera thats all
9038,2.0,if you were looking for a class microsd card in order to directly transfer files from your pc to your phone the fastest way possible you can go with a cheaper class instead of this one the speed is not much different than other class microsd cards ive had its very far from the mbs they promise i got only about mbs at much and after a few minutes its downhill from there i tested on both windows and linux and didnt see a difference luckily theres not a lot of difference in price between a high quality class and this one but then again maybe i didnt look at the class the way i should have since i was focused on getting a class oh well youve been warned dont expect magic from this cardupdate sandisk proactively answered this review to ask me to contact them the reason i didnt contact them first its because you usually receive slimy answers from this tech support and hardly any solution or help it is indeed a waste of time after sandisk comment i contacted them through one of their live chat agents and this is the interchange my suspicious were confirmed and i indeed wasted my timedaniel s hello thank you for contacting sandisk my name is daniel s please give me a moment while i look into your questionfer da heyfer da i just got this answer from sandisk httpwwwamazoncomreviewremaxpnidzdrefcmcdnotfmessageieutfcdforumfxfnzeimhndcdpagecdthreadtxvkcupwnixmxfkeevwiiledaniel s please tell me what is written on the face of the memory cardfer da never thought of contacting you because i thought i was just going to waste my time but it was nice to be contacted proactively by youfer da okfer da the same thing as the one on the picturefer da sandisk ultrafer da microsdhc ifer da gbdaniel s please allow me a momentfer da will you need more info from the carddaniel s the sandisk ultra card is a uhsi card and provides optimum performances when used with a uhsi enabled device or card readerfer da my phone is off lolfer da it says that it is a class card i bought it because of the promise of better speeds than the regular class when using it with my phonedaniel s i would like to inform you that you will get the minimum read speed of mbps on a uhsi enable device as the card is built on the uhsi technologyfer da and write speedsfer da im getting like mbsfer da a far cry from the mbs promiseddaniel s i would like to inform you that so i said the card is built on the uhsi technology it will give the optimum speed with an uhsi enable devicedaniel s you will get the minimum write speed of mbps with an uhsi enable devicefer da okfer da waste of time confirmeddaniel s i would like to inform you that if youll use this card with an uhsi enable device it will give you the optimum speed as its promisedaniel s is there anything else i may assist you withremoved one star because of the sliminess of contacting me via amazon to show sandisk cares but not really offering any real support when contacted
9039,4.0,cute design details on shoulder make the tshirt more special but it runs large so that kind of takes away from the styling got it on super sale so ill keep it maybe a wash will shrink it a bit

9052,4.0,i love love this dress except for the armpits if they had just made the armpits a normal round shape with normal openings the dress would have been perfection so audrey hepburn but i had to say no i really wish they would redo this dress with normal arm openings i think it would sell like crazy
9053,2.0,i was very excited to buy this card gb for my samsung galaxy note the product arrived promptly and i was able to format it to ex fat and use it right away in my smart phone however exactly days later when i removed the card after turning off the phone and inserted it in my desktop i got an error saying that the card was corrupted and unreadable and that i needed to format itsince i had already got a lot of data on it including a lot of videos and images of our newborn twins formatting was not a viable optioni tried to get the card working on my pc desktop mac air laptop and the samsung galaxy note but to no avail finally i decided to format it there too i kept getting errors and that the computer was unable to format the card finally i tried full format via my pc got an error again and then right away quick format and that worked so the card is back and working in my note again but now i wont trust it anymore not after having lost so many irreplaceable images and videosi am a professional photographer and use memory cards all the time this has been the worst of the lot
9054,3.0,if i could return this i would not as helpful as youd think cant ask it questions like google takes forever to send people messages
9055,2.0,very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium it was apparently not available in the medium i was charged a fee for return shopping so i immediately went to website medium available and i had to pay another for shipping seems a bit unreasonable but really liked the dress
9056,2.0,doesnt play my itunes library
9057,4.0,the phone design was very good very compact for hold the hand and camera is very good is clicked perfectly photos
9058,2.0,after reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out unfortunately the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot i like the idea but its just not a flattering cut or material going back
9059,3.0,i love this dress i mean it si really pretty in person however the breast area is just too small i cant wear a bra with it and my older breasts just droop not flattering they are barely covered i am a bit disappointed at that but if you are smaller up there i say give it a try i am lbs ion waist dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest colors and fabric are great i love that the different colors are different types of fabric too bad
9060,1.0,phone screen aspects ratio is wrong hight and width ratio is wrong so you cant watch movie on full screen as well as photo
9061,2.0,one of the two speakers is not working my third redmi phone and first bad experienceplease do the needful as soon as possible
9062,1.0,my hair is straight with dry ends and prone to greasiness i think my hair was deydrated because when i have used hair oils it seems to get better and the ogx spray in oil was amazing i tried this as it was half price at superdrug but it leaves my hair in such a bad state not only would my hair get greasy faster than normal but it created extra tangles and static to boot it almost felt like that desperate time i washed my hair with shower gel dark times i try not to think about it with dry scratchy ends my boyfriend thinks its great but its a no go for me im afraid
9063,4.0,this is the second card ive purchased of this exact model the first one i had went bad after about months to be fair i had it in a rooted galaxy s with cm loaded on it so its possible that something in the experimental firmware messed up the cardim back on the stock rom now due to issues with g lte im not even rooted anymore so im hoping that the card remains solid this time everyone else seems to love it so im hoping serves me well for a long timeso far so good
9064,3.0,the performance is poorer and the camera quality is not upto the mark
9065,3.0,i hardly write reviews about products but felt like putting this out there this is an okish sort of product do not expect it to outperform its competitorsbecause it does not the only usp this product has that makes people want to buy it is the samsung batch after using it for a month i can honestly tell that this phone is not the best investment i made it hangs abruptly and every now and then it lags battery life is good but if you expect samsung to deliver you a premium product then dont fool yourself better to invest your money elsewhere or save and get a better phone also the system shows warning of moisture in the usb port and every now and then it does not charge honestly read the good reviews and fell for it my bad
9066,2.0,i am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress when i received it it looked nothing like it does on the model the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled if you have anything above a c cup the top looks completely unflattering i looked so top heavy in this dress definitely not worth the price so disappointed
9067,5.0,it is best phones under ksize is also best not so large and not smallperformance is very nice
9068,5.0,this was a great price for this card and they are not cheap made save several buying form amazon the local stores was a lot higher
9069,2.0,sadly this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour it snagged on everything my watch my purse my necklace i had to go home change and return the dress later impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress
9070,4.0,this pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didnt the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring overall cute especially for the price if not on sale i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome
9071,2.0,i wanted to love this dress it really has no style i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight had to return it
9072,2.0,heating issue while charging
9073,2.0,the battery back up is terrible down in minutes
9074,3.0,although the fabric and color is beautiful the sleeves do not lay properly they are too stiff and look like wings on me sadly i must return the quality looks great it is unfortunate that the design was a miss
9075,4.0,i liked this phone for following things display is gorgeous phone is really compact and light weight considering its mah battery always on display feature is also cool dolby atmos feature is worthy i disliked this phone for following things battery doesnt performing like mah only day back up camera is also good on paper pic is good until you zoom it plastic back cover is really gives cheap feel no back cover provided
9076,2.0,while ogx products generally smell great the scents do not linger in your hair past the shower some of their translucent shampoos have an odd gelatinous texture that causes a lot of waste think semiset jello you literally have to put the shampoo on your head because it will fall out of your hands i find that the product doesnt lather with the ease of most shampoos the upside to this product is it doesnt contain methylproplong ingredient name at the end of most shampoo ingredient lists that causes kidney problems
9077,4.0,worth buying this phone
9078,5.0,this dress looks way better on you than sitting on the hanger the design really flatters your body and the waist area makes you look very skinny highly recommend the length is also perfect just the right length for a maxi dress long enough but short enough to show off your shoes as well
9079,5.0,great price for a fast large micro sd card recieved it super fast too works perfectly with my droid verizon wanted for a class card like this

9088,1.0,no charger provided
9089,3.0,i was expecting this to be longer nothing wrong with it i will be returning it because it was a little short
9090,1.0,hey guys please dont buy this phone its heat all the time camera quality is also soo bad
9091,4.0,i love amazon for their best of price n fastest delivery product received was good i havrnt gone through the contentbut saw few topics it seems good
9092,4.0,useful book for competitive examination specially for covering gk part
9093,2.0,i loved this shirt flattering and pretty its hand wash only or dry clean i hand washed it and the blue tshirt part of the shirt shrank and now the front of the shirt is too short for me would not recommend due to shrinkage too bad
9094,1.0,dear amazon stop insulting hindu god and our indian culture by selling such products like doormat with photo of hindu gods otherwise we all together leave amazon forever and you will leave your precious customer and revenue as well its serious enough is enough
9095,3.0,im usually a small but the skirt of the dress was a bit loose and added love handles to my figure when i wear it a smaller size would work better its cute and i love it but the material is form fitting and do a larger size isnt flattering an xsmall for me
9096,5.0,does its job not much to say its sandisk so you know its pretty much the standard for consumerlevel flashbased data storage
9097,4.0,enjoy it so far but still finding things that i can do with it not very sure of how to get to some of the things i would like to try
9098,4.0,slim and stylish design good for those who dont like big phones
9099,1.0,i dont expect samsung has given this type of cheap phones processior was worst hanging issues should be there overall very bad quality phone i ever purchased when i opened the camera it was hanging when i was opened the application it was hanging
9100,4.0,nice lookbuildgood speaker soundbattery life should improvecamera excellent
9101,4.0,this dress is really cute but it runs quite large order a size smaller i got a lot of compliments on it at the party i wore it to it can be dressed up or can be casual with a pair of sandles
9102,1.0,camera quality was worser than other products of this range and type looks like a defective piece response from amazon was very bad and they mentioned the difference in atmosphere between european countries and india to justify the poor picture quality in this phone we checked through the smartcheckapp blancco it passed the test saying that the camera is able to click the picture it didnt test anything beyond that how irresponsible these guys are i will thrash this phone and thrash amazon for this buy this at your own risk
9103,1.0,product is not full hd blatant lie its only x is hd ready not full hd dint expect this from cloud tail there are better products with full hd at slightly higher price this is fooling people tried calling amazon or chatting impossible to reach a human this is an integrity issue after s of sales why is this not corrected
9104,1.0,the mobile heats up at the back power backup is less nothing as compared to the paid reviews when complained on the power backup to the illiterate amazon executive she says that power draining fast is normal when not in use what a discovery
9105,1.0,may be a used or duplicate piece evenafter overnight charging it is not showing more than light mobile got charged only after thatits only a month after purchase sad
9106,5.0,the tv it is absolute value for money watching k pictures on youtube the quality is mindblowing though there isnt much free k content available that is worth watching but this tv is ready when needed it nicely upscales p and p content has a nice frame rate and the speakers are decent the pictures are bright and crisp viewing angles are great it does an admirable job for sd channels as well has a phone app in case youre one of them who habitually misplaces the remote the app does exactly the same things as the remote does and takes voice commands as well the appstore is very minimalistic has prime videos netflix and youtube but popular apps like hotstar sonyliv zee voot and many more are missing you need to buy fire stick or chromecast for additional apps in summary for the price as a k uhd tv this panasonic is bang for the buck but not the best smart tv features
9107,3.0,i loved this top when i saw it online and ordered it right away however the fit is way off i am always a size medium always but i was swimming in this and had to return it even if it had fit i wasnt thrilled with it i thought it would be something i could dress up especially with the lace detail but instead it looked really frumpy i would recommend this top as long as you know to order a smaller size and are looking for something a little more casual
9108,3.0,need more data sources for it to pull from
9109,3.0,camera quality is good battery life is bad
9110,4.0,guess s is still better
9111,2.0,this top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring so disappointing mailing it back
9112,3.0,i received these pants but they are not as pictured see the photo of the back pockets there is a detail there that was not on the pants that i received im not sure about these the quality is nice but they are much baggier than shown and i ordered sizes down
9113,2.0,everything i liked about it except the battery life from the first day battery drains out very fast hardly last for hours very disappointed
9114,3.0,neat gadget for young kids or grandkids to play with sound quality is nothing like the full size echo
9115,3.0,i practically live in lounge pants and i like the unique style of this wideleg version im generally a in pants and ordered the small which fit well if a bit big the overall fit is great slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband and flatteringlyplaced dropped pockets the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness as for color i would call these a deep cool brown definitely not
9116,2.0,alexa wont liste of you command her to play a song on vol and then say alexa no response at all
9117,4.0,nice phone with affordable prize
9118,1.0,gets hanged oftenring tone is very slowevery now and then have to restartlooks beautiful but very weak broken back side when slip from hand overall it is just a waste of money
9119,3.0,the camera is not at all what was expected the quality of pics is highly pixelated
9120,1.0,i really really wanted to love this thing i have three children ages and younger and was really looking forward to a handsfree device that had more range than my phone to do things like set timers play music answer simple questions like what time is it etc so the good is that the device always recognizes exactly what i say to me someone who is definitely not a software engineer it seems like speech recognition is the hardest part after the device has the text of the request logged it should be able to complete the request easily unforunately after it says something like ok lets listen to some music and im telling you it pretty much always understands my question after it gets the request it just doesnt do anything sometimes we ask it three times and then it will actually turn the music on sometimes it will literally turn the music on minutes later sometimes it will stop the music randomly minutes after starting it there is no predictability at all as to how it will actually work for example i just asked it to set a timer for minutes and it didnt give me a confirmation or anything so i assumed it didnt work now as i write this the timer is going off as a device it is an awesome concept but it has proven completely unreliable for our needs and now has just become an expensive paperweight just an fyi this is our second dot we exchanged it thinking the first was broken we have done restarts resynchs etc this thing just doesnt work well for more than a week or two after being reset
9121,5.0,i loooooove this oil i put it on every time i get out of the shower and even before bed on dry hair its great my hair absorbs it all it makes my hair soft and hydrates it my hair used to be so dead and dry from all the damagebut now the ends have come back to life since ive been using this my hair now has curls at the ends this stuff is amazing
9122,1.0,i stop working after two days it cannot be charged and it cannot charge anything very dissapointing im going to return it absolutely useless
9123,4.0,im a ml size in most thingsdepending on the maker and design i tried this vest on with the paired top in the photo and couldnt believe how big and boxy it was very boxy it looked dumpy on my frame i thought it might work because i have broad shoulders to hang the vest offbut noooo i have breast and that ruined it well there you go a size c wasnt going to help with this one but im going to try sizing down to a small to give it a chance in fitting better it runs at least
9124,4.0,good quality but heating problem
9125,2.0,purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail i dont know why most designers overlook the back huge disappointment the back is totally plain not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isnt even the same material as the front its almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment it was a very sad return i usually love this brand this was just a quality control oversight i guess
9126,3.0,i absolutely fell in love with this dress when i saw it online but unfortunately it just didnt fit right the bust and bodice not designed for curves and the dress just didnt fit correctly i think it would work better on very slim figures
9127,4.0,good productvalue for money
9128,4.0,i recomend to all to buy this product without any hesitation
9129,5.0,i loved this power bank and this product is totally reliable after getting fully charged it works for around week even though my phones battery is only mah still it manages to work for so long
9130,5.0,excellent product looks and feels very good
9131,1.0,over heats
9132,1.0,all things are good but the camera is the worst the worst camera phone i ever seen i think i have to go for mi but unfortui i chose these
9133,3.0,using since yrs volume has lower down
9134,3.0,mi a is a good phone not a great phone no mm jack ok so slim design looks nice and makes handling this phone easy but you cannot charge and use the earphone simultaneously display is terrible with low brightness and outdoor screen visibility is just plain bad
9135,1.0,i tried this on in the store and i couldnt keep it on my body for more then seconds its extremely itchy which is a pity because i do appreciate the design
9136,2.0,cable is not charging just after months of purchase
9137,3.0,they boasted about photos quality in the night which is horrible when compared to one plus wide photos are really useless because the pic is curved video quality is horrible when compared to one plus also the picture quality is horrible compared to one plus t finally it is a phone for middle class people who r obsessed with apple brand but cannot afford one i would suggest people to use money wisely and skip this apple product i would like to get rid of mine but i spent whopping price on this garbage
9138,1.0,i bought the sandisk ultra gb card for use in my samsung smart phone worked great for about months now the phone wont recognize the card neither will my computer just went unreadable one day very disappointed in the reliability of this card will contact sandisk as it has a lifetime warranty shall see if theyll stand behind their product
9139,4.0,i bought of these in peach and maize the fabric is yummy and soft as silk the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great however there is too much fabric if only a bit less the fabulous swing shape would work that said im keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house if sale was on sale again
9140,1.0,not up to the mark
9141,1.0,this product is worst it buffers too much i have another old version it runs good i replaced it and it stream quality is the worst first i thought internet speed was good but later i came to know its the device
9142,4.0,hade a problem but it was taken care of
9143,5.0,fingerprint reader is so fast and camera quality and camera resolution is very good or the best part of m is battery is almost remain percent till evening i love this phone
9144,2.0,very very poor battary backup finger print reader wors very slowly
9145,1.0,the product stopped working just after days completing the warranty period money got wasted worst experience from amazon faulty duplicate product given
9146,4.0,first of all for all of those who will take my review as biased let me tell you i am developer and not using iphone or osx first time i own various apple product but i am not sheeple phone is good no doubt perfect beast battery is good atleast for me it allows me to take my call through my macbook without touch it even it use macbooks mic for call osx compatibility is the best thing you can have in apple pros battery backup is good no hang issue processor is beast security is too notch sound quality is good camera is average not best for the price cons i am not satisfied with fingerprint sensor it wont work if my finger is wet i paid k seriously and even redmi works pretty good with wet finger touch wont work if you in pool samsung is better in this i know it might not matter for you but it does if you had this things in mind while buying it
9147,2.0,okayish not value for money skip this one
9148,3.0,camera quality is too bad like megapixel although battery life is very satisfactory and so the speed of ram
9149,1.0,product is delivered but installation is still not done after days amazon and samsung reps have been making me go between each other without any help
9150,5.0,good phone good camera with long battery backup
9151,4.0,thoughfuly organised a good vocabulary builder
9152,3.0,phone have a heating problem on the side of screen at normal uses and camera blurs effect is also not got at selfie camera also take lot of time to change with fast charger approx to hour for full charger
9153,5.0,i put this microsd card in my note ii phone and i have had a seamless experience with it programs that are on the card operate as quickly and flawlessly as those that are on my phones memory it will hold dozens of programs and gives me all the expandibility that i will need unless i start collecting hd movies on my phone this card seems to be designed specifically for smartphones and does its job very well recommended
9154,1.0,its not that goodand price also slashed k in just weeksthis is most pathetic
9155,4.0,amazing for gaming terrible battery life not what you would call light weight looks are subjective but i like the looks of it there are a few things that are objective the bezels are too thick and flimsy it looks like they can easily break the black on red looks good for gaming but not good for daily use as such the faux carbon fiber texture makes it look slightly better than what it actually is the experience the display is ok not great but definitely not bad the laptop has good specs however the keyboard backlight times out even when plugged in this started happening after the bios update on battery the performance takes a hit even if you set windows to high performance mode to extract the best experience plug it in before you start any cpu intensive tasks this laptop came with intel optane technology and a hdd i upgraded it to a tb ssd and the performance is better even with the hdd the performance was not bad but the ssd made it better there is only gb ram and i use it for audio production as well so i run out of ram pretty soon thats when the audio artifacts kick in for gaming and daily use i havent reached a point where lack of ram made it bad but i assume that the ssd with optane makes up for the lack of it the audio is underwhelming i had a dell xpslx prior to this and that had jbl speakers and woofer builtin and audio tuning as well so sound wise that blows this out of water even though its more than years old now dont expect to be able to tune this laptop as there are hardly anything to play with in the bios connectivity you get a hdmi port usb and a usb port you get a usb type c port which is usb so you can use a extension to get more usb ports there is a lan port and just one audio pin you have a memory card reader which i find handy considering that my other phone houses a memory card conclusion if you get this less that k just go for it you wont get a i th gen with all these features at this price point dont expect perfection accept its limitations and you will be satisfied
9156,4.0,i bought mi a gb ram gb as a gift for my hubby first and the same day the price of this phone went down rupees my bad he wanted a more powerful one with gb and gb which was also reduced in price so i had to order again price wise its good have to use it and see the durability camera quality is awesome red comes out more helps in case you have color blindness to see red lol
9157,3.0,the camera quality is not good as mentioned in the description of the product this seems like samsung fitted a mp camera instead of mp when u zoom images they are blurred if u take pics of some text or number from distance u cant read it i exchanged it with my teri note and now i am disappointed that the mi was better than this it took more than a hour when u boot it first time the voice quality is also not good in vedio and music
9158,4.0,i do love this shirt as i am a yogi and love to wear things like this it was a little boxy and big but dont care because the style of it is so cute
9159,5.0,super easy and cute i received lots of compliments

9162,1.0,product having problem within days camera not working volume button has been hard to operate display also creating problem
9163,1.0,poor battery drains within hours totally false claims regarding long lasting battery product hardware quality indicates not so long durability and for fear of loss water resistance not checked
9164,3.0,disadvantages do not support clone app other than few social apps get hung sometimes not that fast wifi range is less its not connecting at the place where my old k mobile connecting to wifi doesnt take photos with finger print sensor auto bright sensor works doesnt work properly sometimes photo quality is not good with back regular cam i personally do not like os advantages good battery life wide angle takes takes really good pics selfie cam is good slow motion and hyperlaps but hyperlaps takes more time to generate small video
9165,4.0,basic knowledge
9166,3.0,oook
9167,3.0,i love this shirt tried in on in stores im typically a medium across the board im lbs d i went for the size figuring the would be too small the fit but its short like everyone else said not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short i didnt buy it for the price tag because of the shortness but now that its i might spring for it regardless of the weird cut its super cute otherwise
9168,1.0,using this stuff requires a great effort for mediocre results i waited out the requisite two days with limp smelly flat hair only to wash it out and find my hairs texture only slightly improved at the expense of its colour but im really compelled to write this because ive just read that the manufacturer has been taken to task for misrepresenting the product as formaldehyde free tests show it does indeed contain this nasty so best stay well clear of it i think if you live in australia you can even get a refund even though traces of formaldehyde may be present unlabelled in lots of products i think this product deserves a dishonourable mention for dodgy ingredient listing and outright falsehoods httpwwwacccgovaucontentindexphtmlitemid

9172,1.0,everything has great in this phone touch sensitivity super amoled screen build quality sensors easy to handle one of the best ui one ui excluding battery backup everyone telling about its battery life but the product which i received has worst quality of battery inside phone when i watched reviews on youtube every popular youtuber told that it has a great battery backup and many things when i used it for two days im very disappointed with this phones battery backup my only purpose to purchase this phone because of its monster size battery backup it loosed my confidence about samsung because first time i purchased any samsung product and it ruins my dreams in just two days my humble request to seller please replace this faulty product as soon as possible because i purchased this phone by requesting my father that this phone has a huge monster size battery and now if my father know that battery backup was not as good as mentioned online and on youtube channels they will never trust on me in future and if i lost his trust then im unable to take any decision independently worst battery
9173,4.0,good phone thats y i bought this mobile
9174,5.0,the fabric and design of this piece are so unique i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears which is the case for this jumpsuit despite the extra volume the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless though it doesnt seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid
9175,5.0,best phone and long battery
9176,1.0,this is very bad product
9177,2.0,i usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didnt im and i ordered a petite small i was swimming in it the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me
9178,5.0,amazing products with price
9179,3.0,i was excited to receive in hopes to wear more as a tunic over skinnies vs a dress for fall this runs sooo very large the material is thick and the pattern is just ok didnt do anything for my hourglass shape returned
9180,4.0,although this phone is now years old it runs ios mostly well with hardly any hiccups or lags i got it for my wife for k with an exchange offer so it was a good deal the fingerprint sensor is faster than s but slower than s
9181,2.0,low budget mobile but u can buy better than these in amazon great indian festival sale for the same cost after using this for a year i found these problems in mobile good for photos poor battery life face recognition was too slow
9182,1.0,sir i have purchased this phone with damage replacement option today ie on while i am passing from afzalgunj to mj market on my bike on the way at seena bakery my mobile phone fell down from the upper pocket on the ground due to which was damaged did i get any replacement of mobile sir

9186,5.0,love this shirt i have it in both colors you can wear it off the shoulder or on its baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough you couldnt see i had drains underneath my tank top i am really grateful for this shirt super soft super cute

9190,2.0,theres just nothing special about it it runs small and the fabric is itchy the design with button caught my eye but i didnt like it well enough to keep it
9191,5.0,best in market today fabulous product all that compact features are available in it
9192,3.0,i love the style but it didnt work for me i ordered the r size they were way too too long i generally wear size and the r length works with most retailer pants with this particular pant i could barely pull up the zipper im not sure what happened bc i havent gained any additional weight i am and lbs unfortunately i had to return the pants i think the design is for supermodels maybe a petite size would have worked the p was out of stock good luck
9193,2.0,this item is pretty the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents my issue with it is its very impractical the fabric is extremely thin and you wouldnt want to wear it in any weather below degrees its ridiculous to advertise this product for a fallwinter season the tube top underneath doesnt work very hard to stay up and isnt a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit why wouldnt they just stitch a lining
9194,2.0,it is a beautiful top but runs huge i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it

9203,5.0,awesome mobile feeling like iphone its so cute and classic
9204,3.0,i thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it either with opening in front or back it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure hook and eye or snap at the top it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily overall glad i bought it
9205,4.0,the silk sequinadorned fabric of this dress is just gorgeous and i love the mix of colors and patterns the shape is very plain though this can work to make the dress less formal so that you could wear the beautiful fabric to a more casual event but im not sure its the most flattering style i am between sizes and i sized up but am wondering if i should have gotten the smaller size maybe that would made for a more flattering fit i was also a bit disappointed that the prettiest parts of

9294,5.0,ive had nothing but success with sandisk microsd cards although you may pay a few bucks more than the generic brand you dont want to trust your pictures or video recording to anything elseas such i only buy sandisk microsd cards keep up the good quality
9295,1.0,item battery in bad condition sim not working in watch
9296,4.0,i like this top and while it doesnt look on me like it does the model i think it will be good for work purposes would say it runs big and does have the maternity look risk i bought this two months postpartum so i need tops that cover the post baby belly and this works for that purpose the grey is nice bought on sale but wouldnt recommend paying full price
9297,1.0,charging is less time worrest mobile for meno headsets delivery boy have a video also see that
9298,4.0,we purchased the echo dot for the music and we absolutely luv her thank you
9299,1.0,not satisfied
9300,4.0,i have only worn this times with no signs of pilling yet it is good for cool spring daysevenings for me itll be the cooler seasons sweater i wear a size large and it fits properly i have worn lightweight long sleeve knit tees under this with ease in the sleeves i think a slim sleeved shirtblouse would work equally well while i like the idea of the pockets i think theyll stretch out easily beyond a tissue or quick hand warming i removed star due to the high price and i receive
9301,4.0,the phone is little bit over priced as compared to features it is offering i have bought gbgb model although it has lens including megapixel main lens yet it is giving average quality pictures
9302,2.0,i wish that the more recent reviews were there when i was researching this because i probably wouldnt have purchased it i have naturally wavycurly hair that i have been wearing au naturalno drying or ironing and though i have drysensitized ends i have an oily scalp which requires daily shampooing so i really needed something to help soften up the ends this didnt do anything except make my hair look greasy i used it numerous times and my hair looked bad each time it leaves a sticky gummy residue that is difficult to wash out smells nice though the fragrance doesnt last
9303,2.0,redundant teachings dull and uncaptivating sorry but have read better books than this following the similar perception
9304,3.0,most useless mobile
9305,1.0,as per my experience worst phone in my life its network signals are very poor and it will getting heat while charging and also using games of half an hour and samsung not accepting easily to get back the product samsung m s is worst phone where other phone like honored mi phones accessible signals are working properly their samsung m s was very very poor please think before ones to before purchase this product
9306,2.0,not bad camera waste
9307,4.0,i love this dress i purchased the neutral motif in a large and it fits wonderfully i have a double d chest and the top of this fits almost perfectly its just a bit snug on top but still comfortable because of the fabric im and the dress isnt too long like most maxis are on me i always have great luck with maeve and plan on purchasing another right now
9308,5.0,i bought this item and at first the card was defective however a quick online chat with sandisk and two weeks later i had a new working device not much to say other than a great product and company definitely recommend
9309,5.0,once you cut and pry your way through sandisks packaging you will be rewarded with a nicelymade and highperforming microsd uhs flash memory it comes formatted to sdorgs standards in fat so its ready to go for most applications my single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter i use those since i frequently switch cards between uses and frequently have them in storage those little boxes are very useful its way too easy to lose a microsdanyway here are the results from atto disk benchmarksettings anticipating digicam use total length mb overlapped io and qd but it never exceeds segment size in kbytes readwrite in kbytesecsize write read sorry for the ugly table amazon does not support consecutive spaces including alt or embedded tabsthis is very fast for a microsd its not quite up to what sandisk achieves in full size uhs sd cards that can write over twice this speed but those are electronically more complex cards the micro form factor likely doesnt permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards note that the read speed is a lot faster than what sandisk promises note also that you will not achieve these speeds with a usb reader you will need either a usb or builtin pcie reader to get accurate results so do not complain to me if you use a usb reader and dont achieve these speedsin any event youd be hardpressed to find anything fastermy personal experience with sandisk products is very good that is ive never had anything fail on me given the very reasonable prices of these i rate them as highly recommended
9310,1.0,i have got the worst peice the mobile dont even work dont on even
9311,3.0,i just think this dress is so cute i love it with booties here are the fit details im and the front of the dress hits just above my knees i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button however the button is very low therefore the sleeve rolls up not mid arm but actually about three inches above my wrist its still super cute just nowhere near my elbow just letting you know final detail that
9312,3.0,m changing my review points aftr mnth of usage as per the specifications phone is a class within itself with fine elegance performance but its biggest problem is broken netwrk connectivity internet isnt working smooth n kps fluctuating same sim wrkng fine on other phone but in this phone it kps on buffering cnt use internet if any emergency logging phone heats up evn fr a min call which too is one of its deficiency rest one cn buy this phone as its size look battery camera n screen r upto d mark
9313,1.0,worst ringer and speaker i have already replaced once and again the new phone as well doesnt ring when someone calls
9314,5.0,i havent done speed tests but this sits in my tablet and lets me store music with easy it is fast enough to stream hd video from
9315,3.0,this is my nd mi i the first one stopped working after months it was gifted to me before buying it again because of it portability and charging speed but ig this product fails again after some months then im never ever buying an mi powerbank in my life
9316,2.0,i love the fit of these pants theyre the perfect slim black pants however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places disappointed by the workmanshipquality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and dont sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product
9317,3.0,had some connectivity issues but otherwise works great
9318,1.0,mobile not working poor service redmi service center kindly replaced mobile r refund my money days replacment policy i m waiting for proper solution
9319,2.0,i think i got or months out of this before it started to fail it is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason designed for durability my foot it might survive in salt water but it didnt survive in a phone that frankly doesnt get a whole lot of use this is the first sandisk product ive ever had fail on me it may still be under warranty but i dont care now that i have to replace it im going to go with another brand
9320,3.0,as mi note pro camera has quality like that it is not
9321,1.0,personally for me i am a fan of boat products but this cable did not stood to the expectations i only used it for days and after that it stopped working i even tried to replace this products but there was no option to return this product i hope if someone will look into the matter and help me out
9322,2.0,i dont know why i bought this phone i dont want to be tied down to using apple battery life is pathetic compared to nokia phone freezes all the time gb screen size is a joke really and transferring files music pictures is a nightmare single sim slot and no expandable storage really and the photos arent great of course low light pictures are decent so to summarise apple never again
9323,5.0,yes it is boxy but by design because it is a shorter length and sheer it isnt an issue for me even as a petite it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if its just floating on your body what doesnt show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse charcoal white threads running throughout the design this adds to the classy look of this top great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out
9324,2.0,i got the memory card problem now its not working at all pls i need the memory card savings things photos videos etc cant any one replay to repair this problem
9325,1.0,what on earth is the use of buying such product when it stop working in one monthyour happiness sailed off like a boat disappointed

9330,3.0,i dont know what the problem with this sweater was on me but it just didnt work it was too wide across the breastline i think creating a boxy shape that just didnt look flattering outside of that the sweater was lightweight and seemed well made i was sad to send it back especially at the sale price
9331,2.0,this is the worst gaming laptop battery life is just hr maximum it works slower than dual core
9332,1.0,bad experience with iphone with in a year wifi and bluetooth is not working and when i am visit iphone store he is asking me to charges up to k
9333,4.0,i really like this shampoo i have somewhat damaged very fine and oily hair i have been using this product every day without any conditioner it is a very thick clear to white jelly substance since it is very thick you might end up using a bit more than you need so do be careful about that it smells just like the bottle indicates like coconut heaven it does contain real coconut milk coconut oil and also egg whites it is also sulphate free this shampoo definitely leaves my hair feeling a lot softer shinier and overall a lot healthier my hair is also easier to comb through after using this shampoo price point isnt bad it ranges from six to nine dollars for thirteen ounces it is available in drug stores and even grocery stores as well so it is very accessible i like it and would repurchase
9334,4.0,actually good products i am so happy
9335,5.0,i dont usually wear maxi dresses because i am tall so they usually arent maxi on me im also hourglass shaped and maxis with no waist definition make me look frumpy this dress solves both those problems its very long and the waist has attached ties to define and keep it from being too billowy its also lined to the knees so you can wear with confidence but still have the bottom be light and breezy
9336,1.0,after updating the sw upgrade asked me to restart then phone got struck appears white screen with android one logo and not moving further cant call customer care as they accept calls from registered number only no phone with me as i purchaged it with exchage on amezon chat there is no proper response

9339,5.0,this is such a unique and beautiful top it will be a goto in my closet all year round the red embroidery is amazing meant to be a loose fit im and lbs and ordered the xs fits perfectly
9340,2.0,the model looks awesome in this cute top but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short for reference im lbs and c the front is nonstretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric yet the back is stretchy in theory its pretty but in reality it doesnt work at least for me i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest
9341,5.0,superb phone with value of money and touch of colour os realme had made a superb phone
9342,1.0,id been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online so when it went on sale i ordered it right away well i was thoroughly disappointed i agree with some of the other reviewers the fit is odd huge on top and too snug on the bottom being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didnt hang well on my curvy body being too loose in some areas and too snug in others also the top is embroidered while the bottom isnt the material is thin and and it definitely isnt high enoug

9348,5.0,the raspberry color is really stunning i have been looking for colored tights for a while and had difficulty finding really rich colors i was thrilled when i saw these ive worn them once so far very comfortable and seem like they will last
9349,1.0,received a damaged product from amazon touch is not working properly mobile is restarted and screen damaged it was identified informed to amazon help desk however there is no proper response from amazon simply ignored the customer i tried several times but there is no proper response even one of my friends displays is fade samsung technician confirmed that this was a defect phone sent for replacement strongly suggest no ms and amazon customer service needs to improve give a proper direction to customers simply worst service by amazon
9350,4.0,thanks amazon nice product and delivery is also good and timely about mi i am already a xiomi user so i had idea about the company and the product mi a is good mobile phone at this price with gb ram and gb memory you would get a very powerful phone you will need to have charger with you as battery gets drained after moderate use of hours overall i like this phone

9357,5.0,i love this dress i bought the navy with white stripes it is comfortable flattering and versatile best of all i received a complement from my husband who never comments on my clothing the drapey knit fabric fits closely but not tightly in the shoulders and bust and then skims over the lower body the fabric is soft and stretchy not too thick but still substantial enough that i did not need to wear support garments underneath i am lbs i wore this to a christmas party and
9358,4.0,the detail and design is gorgeous on the tank my issue however is that the yellow is pretty bright the website makes it look like a butter yellow but it is actually a lemon yellow i do not care for that shade and would definitely limit what i paired it with bummer

9363,3.0,mi tv not working power not come in tv so please rectify this problem
9364,5.0,this dress is even better in person the base color of the fabric is a very light peach and very lovely as you can see from the photos the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress but i found the front on mine was very similar to the st photo the bright green flowers are a light mint green which plays beautifully with the light peach there are more details in the print to discover in person which is a nice bonus the silk is not stiff li
9365,2.0,it took forever to connect to wifi and then she would disconnect randomlywhen i kept trying to reset it connect she never wanted to i finally had to completely reset the whole thing times and when that happened then the bluetooth wouldnt work so i had to redo iti have had no problems with my regular alexa so was very disappointed by the dot
9366,5.0,excellent phonebest camera qualitygives a royal feeling thanxxs amazon for such a great delivery
9368,4.0,after the first try i did not like this at all it didnt lather much or clean my hair well enough but i used it again last night amp shampooed twice and it was totally different it lathered beautifully amp my hair felt squeaky clean but not stripped it was shiny after i dried it too i guess you have to use it a couple times for it to really start working maybe it has to break through the layer of existing sulfates on your hair or something i like this shampoo a lot it smells wonderful too very similar to tbs satsuma and the scent lingers a good long time
9369,5.0,excellent book so much inspiration i got from this as well as from the videos must read for everyone
9370,5.0,ive tried many of the shampoos in the organix line the sea mineral works the best for my hair in conjunction with the awapuhi conditioner this combination provides just the right amount of moisture to my hair to lay the foundation for daily blow drying
9371,1.0,product is bad dissatisfied with the performance excessive issues battery draining with minimal usage order page states product can be returned within days but am unable to return the product are not getting the option can amazon please look into it help
9372,4.0,nice promotion but difference between official paper specification with actual product cons mega pixel camera is not upto the mark for still photography quality wise it is max mp gb ram but its system occupying more than gb photo quality seems very good while you see those in this phone but in computer it is really not good enough comparing with other same or low budget samsung mobile pros nice look reasonable price slow motion and super slow motion video recording mha battery at last ms it not good enough to consider for photography
9373,3.0,beautiful look but cellphone its ok
9374,4.0,must read but not provided with bookmark by the seller
9375,3.0,awasome mobile in this price mah battery is really killer camera and steady mode video recording is nice super slow motion is fun sometimes display is killer overall nice budget phone above given feedback was on st day but now i am very disappointed with camera performance i took sample in many situation
9376,4.0,this is a lovely top received many compliments felt very feminine and perfect for chilly spring please take this to the dry cleaners you will avoid feeling distraught as i did after washing it which is the recommended method to clean it and seeing it shrunk to half its previous size sad
9377,5.0,warn and super soft love it
9379,5.0,love love love this living alone its nice to have someone else to talk to each day a simple alexa good morning is nice on the way to the kitchen i havent really read the users guide so we experiment a lot ive become accustomed to her umm i dont think i know that she does refer me a lot to the setup guide or the users guide but ive got the hang of getting the daily news in brief the weather for the day and having her read me an audible book she even paused when i asked her the next day i asked her to continue reading book title replace that with the title of the book she retrieved the book quickly and picked up where we left off shes told me some jokes and sang me the pirate song i found myself dancing around to that one thats right hopping around in my living room with my walker to alexa singing the pirate song shes worth far more than this senior citizen paid for her
9380,1.0,i bought iphone plus and se both are working smooth and perfect coz i got it from store not some stupid online seller mehnga roye ek baar aur sasta roye baar baar har baar do not trust online sellers for electronic items its cheap that means something is not right
9381,1.0,ive been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell which i imagine is some kind of starchchemical to keep the denim stiff with the first pair after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldnt return them the nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them it may be they are made elsewhere now but its disappointing
9382,3.0,connection to spotify and phone which is pretty new breaks up constantly the speaker doesnt get much louder than the phone either radio options seem promising though if you just want some background noise
9383,2.0,bought this for my year olds long slightly dry very thick hair nope fail made her a frizzbomb
9384,1.0,i got a defective product wifi is not working after called several times the technician did not come asus and amazon both are cheating with us
9385,5.0,well had a very good experience with the speaker and its sound quality enough for a single room and light music very high quality send if you play movies
9386,5.0,the phone is really good truly represents the brand value of nokia the only drawback is the battery it gets drained very easily apart from that its good to go a musthave budget phone
9387,1.0,impressed with the pricing and the product but the earphones are not balanced such a pity the saddest part is that it cannot be replaced as well only return never buy this product during offers
9388,5.0,just received the phone so can give a review only after month but overall i noticed that mia does not have tap tap feature for waking the cell and also no pattern lock feature all else is fine clarity is excellent and feel of phone is too good have not used the fingerprint reader and do not intend too also as it is not foolproof in case you get hurt on your finger sound clarity is good overall good product
9389,1.0,no no no the product is really hard to get out after a couple uses and my hair felt no moisture whatsoever i would not recommend this to anyone unless you want a conditioner to not do anything to your hair i got it on sale for original was at shoppers drug mart and now know why
9390,4.0,performance good but battery drain fast
9391,4.0,battery is getting weaker day by day
9392,4.0,this review is for the conditioner not the treatment i have dry hair very fine but lots of it it is naturally curly but i blow dry it or times a week i have received a shampoo as a gift called agadir argan oil shampoo i could not find the conditioner from this brand so i bought the organix moroccan argan oil conditioner i am surprised about all the bad reviews this conditioner works fine for me it makes my hair soft clean does not way it down it it not the best ever but it is also not the worst i find that my hair looks healthier and more lively
9393,5.0,very good experience
9394,4.0,quality is good
9395,2.0,beautiful print however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer much sheerer than the product shot shows i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami however my nude bra was completely visible the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans so much shorter than the tunic length shown and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person the top half of the sleeves are slim and the bottom half are looser over
9396,3.0,i was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed it is much thinner than it seems it almost feels like a cheap top its also seethrough but im not bothered by that it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms but overall i didnt care for this top expected it to be more structured stiff rather than flimsy thin its going back
9397,1.0,already replaced it once and have it serviced another time
9398,3.0,the bulb was fused but everything else was good
9399,5.0,when i spotted these online i knew i had to try them out in the past charlie pants have always been too baggy in the legs for me when trying the regular sizes on in the store well these are described as slim tailored in details so decided to order my usual size regular upon arrival they were baggy in the thigh area the rise was fine but the crotch area pardon me was a little on the short side buttons were difficult to slip into the buttonhole unbuttoning was a job guess the hol
9400,2.0,the picture quality is very poor the battery is getting heat its not worth for rs
9401,4.0,the material is different than i expected but i like it a lot the dress is extremely tight fitting i will be returning it if i cant figure something out im a d and wear a very very restricting in the chestshoulder area unfortunately it may just not be designed for my body type getting the dress on was for sure one of my hardest workoutsand i crossfit oh and the bow does not come off at all so good luck with that the red color is gorgeous i hope it works out
9402,4.0,very good book
9403,4.0,great dress looking forward to wearing it with tights fits great
9404,5.0,the cut of this dress is designed for any figure the back hem sweeps as you walk and the pleats prevent the material clinging to places you want to downplay such as bulges even flat chested women can look curvy and lovely in this dress only downside if any is the lavender coloring which doesnt do much for impact if you are pale skinned and fair im blonde and while i got lots of compliments on the becoming flow of the dress even i can see it doesnt say wow because i kind of fade away
9405,1.0,i tried the ever straight brazilian keratin therapy flat iron spray both because it has keratin and was on sale it did nothing for my hair and other reviews are right it smells like alcohol i will not buy this product again
9406,2.0,have touchpad issue and even after showing complete network signal my number remains unreachable dual sim doesnt work properly
9407,3.0,sound quality is not much as expected
9408,5.0,super data transfer sped and value for money card
9409,1.0,no battery pickup
9410,5.0,excellent product must buy
9411,1.0,back camera contamination it is not good value for money
9412,3.0,i feel a little cheated they state that this is the best for android phone yet it failed i never even removedi have had other memory cards last me years upon years have to look for another one so disappointed the phone moved smoother but not sure it is worth it
9413,1.0,no matter what is excellent in a product it doesnt matter if it doesnt turn on after a day you guys are enforcing a replacement for a failed model we cant keep working with warranty and keep the product in manufacturers shed for days got shut down in two days boat needs to review this product bottom reviews say the same problem issue with charging i have purchased boat devices so far i am disappointed for the first time because of this product and enforcement for replacement this leaves me no option but to stop believing in boats own customer service for the problems posted by customers amazon just play with its policies its the manufacturer who needs to go beyond and hel its customers refund me for this defective product and i would like to purchase a new one of different model or make
9414,3.0,has a pleasant shea butter and coconut milk scent this is a basic daily conditioner that detangles hair well it did not add hydration to my hair nor diminish frizz just average to me
9415,2.0,camera feature not working properly battery not support for hours when we use internet
9416,3.0,for the first two weeks the connectivity was fine but now even when the phone is in my hand and i am watching a series the headphones just disconnects again and again

9420,3.0,there is a problem wd the handset it seems the mobile is not catching the signals properly the voice is breaking and not clear most of the time it does not detects the sim and gives as out of coverage area or switched off messages are not delivered
9421,5.0,nice tv i loved it much sound was vey nive screen casting was nice
9422,1.0,no rating as it is faulty item
9423,5.0,looks nice excellent battery life more than weeks accurate tracking if u want more features use your mobile for calling google assistant etc
9424,2.0,this is my second echo i cant get this one to stream any music from my amazon library very disappointing i certainly wont buy others ive tried over and over to reboot it and it just wont connect
9425,2.0,didnt work in my samsung
9426,5.0,i installed this micro sd in my asus tf transformer and it worked even though the tablet only supports up to gb this added gb of usable space
9427,4.0,hi received kevin led with wifi option package very secured but after checking some very light lines are in display paoint so this is forvyour info and another one is any person came to our place and fixed our tv can u replay me once very urgent
9428,2.0,this product left my hair greasylooking regardless of the amount i used i was surprised because i have thick dark blonde virgin hair the oil sits on the hair cuticle and does not seem to penetrate i use avon moroccan oil now thats worth investing in and its not expensive
9429,5.0,its not just for worry but timeless advice to live a happier life
9430,4.0,love this sweater it is so cozy i gave it a four because it does shed a lot i have not washed yet but hopefully that will help with the shedding i am hoping to buy other colors
9431,4.0,fun versatile top for casual wear with capris denim or shortsskirts purchased both striped versions love ballet necklines the length sleeve is wonderful for spring summer fall in california the top is fitted yet it runs small be sure to sized up i normally wear xs however this was way too tight so ive ordered a small in both hoping it works perfectly
9432,1.0,battary problem
9433,2.0,i ordered the white denim online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering but too sheer for me to wear outside the house
9434,1.0,amazon ridiculous your products in sale work for few days and then stop working suddenly why do u sell such bad quality products that cant even last a year or two dont loot ur customers in the name of sale pathetic and horrible stuff
9435,4.0,first off i love these jeans they are the exact look i have been searching for and the bands around the hem are what really sold me on this specific pair the only problem which i found with a previous purchase is that they hit me at the ankle rather than what is pictured since i liked everything about these jeans i decided to so with plan b and had them altered to be about an inch shorter this involved cutting the hem at the top of the bands and reattaching the stitching blends
9436,1.0,tama price is common in every seller there was no good offer for this product the price is too low at dushera time why not now
9437,1.0,worst experience my wish to use stock android was fullfiled today but my joy was ruined by the pathetic screen qualityworst screen ever
9438,3.0,build quality of this phone is bad i mean you can simply feel the cheap build quality of this phone so my suggestion is whenever u buy this phone also buy good tempered glass and good back cover at that time for me this phone is good for entertainment not for gamers if your a pubg lover then please never ever think to buy this phone
9439,1.0,mobile is not working product is very bad product died on next day after the delivery
9440,4.0,mi mobile value for money normal use best
9441,2.0,i bought these last year and loved them however they came in tall sizes this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short even at im and they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal
9442,2.0,i wanted to try this for the volume i like some of their other products i used this and it dries out my hair something awful yes i have shine but there really isnt a volume trade off with this i used it with a coconut conditioner which is supposed to give light feeling hydration to the hair what a joke i need to return this
9443,3.0,picture quality is good battery life average however hangs
9444,2.0,i was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online however i was very disappointed when i finally received it the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person i could almost get over the sleeves but the white part of the shirt was horrible i am and a size i wear a size small at retailer and i got a small in this top the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line which i
9445,1.0,horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
9446,3.0,think price convinced me to put this in my bag the oops of on line shopping i guess the strip and stitch like snowflake is just not me a little too cutesy for me if strip alone might have kept but this is just too much not my style back it goes
9447,5.0,fingerprint ok not extraordinary camera quality is good battery life is extraordinary display and other features are excellent lite weight simple and sexy i think samsung comeback to the trend now if they make the finger print sensor at front and front flash means its extraordinary worthy to ur money
9448,5.0,just got this in a petite lbs b and it fits perfectly the length is right at the bottom of the knee it is fitted tight at the waist and the belt is even more beautiful in person this dress has some weight and the quality seems excellent there is a scalloped nude lining that is attached to the dress and the dress can be unzipped from the bottom as well there is a darker lace fabric under the armpit which i like since it hides your armpits much better than the sheer red lace fab
9449,3.0,these looked so cute and colorful very sad to receive them yesterday and having to return them today cute overall but run large depending on cutstyle i range from in bottoms i ordered a in these and they were just way too big i would exchange for a zero but i bought them for a trip this weekend oh well consequence of online shopping
9450,4.0,absolutely in love with this shirt the neckline is extremely flattering and the shirt naturally comes away from the body
9451,2.0,the dress is very pretty but the sequins are dark blue i imagined they would be silvergold given the photo but the dress is essentially light pink and blue
9452,3.0,i ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews it is more like marroon i am very disappointed the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality it is long and has the belt at the back but the fit and quality overall are very plain it looks a tad dowdy i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings but it is definitely not dressy perhaps white may not look as bad the plain design and marroon dull color dont help
9453,1.0,very poor
9454,1.0,i bought this in april and speaker stopped working after month it was working fine but suddenly dead
9455,5.0,this dress is so pretty on i almost didnt try it on because on the hanger it didnt look like it would have any shape well it is super drapey and flowy and it looks great on almost swing style it is doubled up on fabric and with the longer sleeves i was scared it would make me too hot but the fabric is light and breathable it will be a perfect transitional dress for fall and early spring fyi the eyelet strip on the front and back are see through didnt realize that the first time i
9456,5.0,i love this shirt it fits great and looks awesome with shorts or skinny jeans i love the beads on the shoulders i liked it so much that i ordered it in colors

9460,5.0,it is a very good and nice refrigerator
9461,5.0,awesome samsung m series nice camera nice battery backup full view display
9462,5.0,i just got this top today the print is just as beautiful in person as it is on the web it is so incredibly soft and comfortable i tried it on and it fits just like the photo i am so i can get away with the blousy effect but i think that is part of why it is so charming i think you could dress it up or down really well i am really pleased
9463,5.0,sound quality is amazing awesome base with good mids and highs the ear buds are comfortable to wear as well
9464,1.0,only sound and weight is good but what i can do from them vivobook is a very slow book i want my cash back it is very slow asus is my fav company but i didnt expect from them its a very slow laptop it takes around mins sometimes to open i feel very bad i spent rs on this book
9465,4.0,type camera are there but ultra wide angle camera not up to the mark other two are excellent and selfie camera is excellent battery is excellent good going as if now
9466,3.0,after losing a lot of weight i thought id try a pair of skinny jeans and since pilcro is my favorite jeans brand i bought my usual pilcro size but wow these are just way too tight they pull on like leggings or tights clinging to every part of your leg there isnt even a bit of looseness around the calves and my lower legs have never been big i kept thinking id just lose more weight and they would fit better but that isnt happening either the fit so these are going to my daughter who
9467,2.0,weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash
9468,1.0,pathetic phone just got it today and updated the stock android with the latest firmware of android pie and system got stuck in a boot loop called amazon to return it and they are sending a tech home pls search google and u will know that there is a known issue plaguing this model

9470,4.0,this dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra i am sending it back because as it runs very small i am a a and the size was too snug across the top
9471,1.0,after use of days display goes black calls are coming phone is working but display not working m just suggestions for all use of amazon please buy realme xt nd just wait for realme x or x pro
9472,4.0,love the colors and design of this laceprinted top but didnt realize its not lined the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos there is a lining under the top the arm holes are slightly cutin both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they dont show other than that its a beautiful unique summer top
9473,3.0,average not good as we expect
9474,5.0,this is a great product i have bought additional echos one for my shop and one for my wife easy to hook up and it sounds great i havent used all the aspects of echo but i will i play a lot of music the amazon prime music is great i tell it to play certain artists and it plays for hours so easy you will love this product
9475,2.0,the interface on my android is very poor there is no search tool for artists and the music unlimited is missnig many key artists work such as santanas caravanserai the android app is horribly slow and crashes alexa doesnt understand me of the time and reacts to my tv even when shes not being addressed very poor job so far
9476,5.0,good description was accurate and delivery was very prompt received in just days
9477,5.0,i use it in my samsung glaxy s to increase more gb the device has gb now increase to gb

9481,2.0,as other reviews have mentioned this top has serious craftsman ship flaws strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on i wanted to love but sadly returned asap
9482,3.0,it is an ok product not that great voulume is very low due to back speaker
9483,3.0,while these seem like interesting designs which i applaud the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing
9484,1.0,i bought this phone in oct it was less than months and the phone started hanging making random noises i have taken it to service centre thrice since then and they have failed to repair it every time each time i go they just factory reset and give it back however the problem still persists on asking them to replace it since the phone is under warranty they ask to contact customer care who in turn asks us to visit service center it has been months since the problem and i dont find any resolution to it would strongly suggest anyone buying mi phones to refrain from buying it their phones are bogus so is their service so are their warranties
9485,5.0,these tights are exactly what i was looking for they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn outdressed up or for lounging around at the house they are a nice weight and durable construction i plan to pair them with skirts tunics and dresses they are super cute with ankle boots

9497,2.0,i loved the cut and style of this shirt so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly seethrough if you do order it get it in a size larger
9498,5.0,hard to review this its an amazing little chip with huge capacity and it does what its supposed to do stars
9499,3.0,purchased this top because of the sale i got it in the peach and the maize i think it is big boxy and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have the colors are vibrant and striking pretty with shorts and capris i did size down from to
9500,3.0,cool bit of technology but the music playback is so spotty its almost not worth listening alone is fine but paired with the sony speaker i bought with it the playback is jerky
9501,3.0,worst experience from huawei customercare battery can max will get hrs with normal internet usage face recognition is not good phone can unlock without eye deflection
9502,2.0,the sweater was nice but not as long as on the model it was itchy also this sweater was not what i had expected their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash sorry retailer i sent it back
9503,3.0,photos capturing is not good when you record video it add extra noise video recordibg stability is not good sametimes get heated even when nothing is running processor is powerful can play pubg easily without lag in high qulity looks are good
9504,1.0,sale me defective product switch off if you touched on palm
9505,4.0,one of the best phones in between these months battery life is very good sound quality is perfect and picture quality is too good also it is not heating thats the best thing i liked a lottotally a perfect phone in a suitable budget for indian people in a single word for saying about this phone is complete perfect the bill sent by amazon or the seller is not very good quality so that in a damaging situation within warranty period may create difficulty this is the one thing that i havent get any answer yetfor this reason i dont give full rating i am giving two opinions about the phone the warranty or payment bill of this product from my own experience choice is yours
9506,4.0,really works well
9507,3.0,too floppy light and comfortable material but the tieneck needs a shirt with a bit more structure
9508,2.0,problem in button
9509,3.0,just got this dress in an xl ive never ordered from retailer before so i expected their clothes to run small i was wrong its a beautiful high quality dress but i think its just too big i may end up exchanging it for a l definitely size down in this dress
9510,5.0,redmi note pro is very good product for this prise camera is also very good quality fingerprint reader battery life is good
9511,1.0,dont buy amazon product

9514,3.0,i would prefer if all of this products skills were preloaded every time i ask it something that it does not know im left wondering if theres a skill out there that would allow it to answer my query
9515,2.0,phone heats up quickly and the plastic body had a defect the edges are bulging and making sound when held with tight grip i tried to replace but amazon service said that every body is facing the same issue i want to ask why im being the suferer i want a proper piece or take the phone back why i am being asked to contact samsung for this when seller is giving me a defective piece i dint expect this from amazon atleast after being a prime customer
9516,5.0,good budget product in this price range smart features work without any lag mirroring with redmi great no options for adjusting contrast brightnesssound equilizer all are preset but for this price ok color is always punchy even ecovision doesnt help in this departmentsound is very loud even at so no need for external bars unless you require very crisp or good bassmost of the commonly used apps are preinstalled and update happens through google play store hence not much issues in software department i can say an overall value for money smart tv one can purchase with above average build quality and main thing jeeves installation team did a great job of installing the tv the very same day of tv delivery
9517,3.0,product not up to the mark very bad display quality and it does not have fast charging fast charger seperately purchased also could not charge fast it takes hours with fast charger with normal charger supplied with the product it take hours to charge product is not worth its price
9518,4.0,the only reason i bought it over redmi note pro is because of its front camera yeah it has more battery life fast charger bundled with it and better display than pro but that hardly matters note pro has better processor excellent design and better ui i would have bought redmi note pro but as it is a gift for someone who is selfie obsessed i went for m final opinion buy samsung m which is a bit expensive but better than m and note pro in all aspects
9519,4.0,picture quality very well and voice recognition is low
9520,1.0,dont ever buy redmi mobile i purchased it weeks back and there is problem in the display company is not even replacing the product now entire money gine waste dont ever buy any of the redmi mobiles
9521,2.0,not good to buy
9522,2.0,camera quality not good
9523,4.0,wonderful and great value for money two usba ports and one micro usb port charging of the power bank is a bit lengthy but other than that this is a must buy got it in offer
9524,4.0,perfect smart phone of the era camera was fabulous and performance pretty good
9525,4.0,superb mobile in this budget segment and i liked overall feature and build quality thanks you amazon and huawei
9526,5.0,this dress fits really cute i actually think its cuter in person than on the site really flattering the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model so its appropriate for work and networking functions im lbs i got the and its great
9527,3.0,this is a beautiful top but the fit is odd its roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight i wear a size in all hd in paris tops but this one didnt fit anything like the others i wouldnt even know what size to recommend because its almost too big in the body while being too tight in the arms the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so im hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably otherwise it will be going back
9528,3.0,the color of this top is lovely however i felt the quality was lacking for the price the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already fit was tts for me
9529,1.0,awful conditioner along with the shampoo from the same range this did absolutely nothing for my hair except make it feel like there was a residue on it which made it difficult to style and left it feeling and looking super greasy and lank by the end of the day it was next to impossible to get out of the bottle because its so so thick again like the shampoo and although the scent wasnt quite as overpowering as the shampoo it wasnt pleasant in fact to me it smelt like melted plastic i used this times then thew it in the garbage along with the shampoo
9530,4.0,it is an amazing phone it packs nice camera long battery life fhd display just go for it you will not regret it
9531,3.0,some basic features like call recording screenshot features are missing
9532,2.0,dont waste ur money buy other mobile its not worth you not play games in this mobile and its a low graphics mobile
9533,5.0,i liked the iphone plus its awesomebut the home button little bit tightdidnt not wireless earphones
9534,1.0,i purchased four items from amazon and when i opened the box my gb memory card was missing so rating this product is truly impossible
9535,4.0,it is good product in this price range
9536,3.0,it is a ok product though works slow after month all features of remote dont work
9537,4.0,unlike the other reviewer i found this skirt to run smallvery small i am pearshaped and always wear a or size the size in this could barely go over my hips and was very snug around the waist another inch in the zipper would be nice there is no spandex in this skirt just cotton so there isnt any give to the fabric either i ordered the size which fit like a glove but i would really like to see if the would be better embarrassing but i am just worried that with
9538,4.0,i found this to fit tts i sometimes wear petite but found the petite sizing to be a little off i have a pretty short torso but found the petite to be too short i opted for the regular sizing and got a it fits great this top is great for work styled with a cardigan or blazer or for play i can see it dressing up or down very easily
9539,2.0,this did not last very long would not work in any of my mobile devices i tried it in different ones and the only place it now works is in my desktop in the adapter sleeve not much use there since i already have tb
9540,4.0,all the things like camera battery fast charging gorgeous screen mp camera slomo k video recording work as advertised however due to use of cheap plastic back the fingerprint sensor woobles a bit also the sound quality could have been better from loudspeaker the call quality is however fine and earpiece is loud enough also there are features from samsung premium phones like always on display lift phone to wake screen etc
9541,2.0,on the hanger i thought this had a chance but oh geez puffy sleeves itchy metallic thread lace what a mess and thin and uncomfortable no no no
9542,5.0,i ordered this in the chocolate color which is really a pinkishtaupebrown but i love the color its neutral yet not too pale just the right hue to go with almost any color and the style works with any outfit from jean shorts to a dress i love how soft the knit is although i worry it might be prone to snag especially the openweave sections i also love that the sleeves are full length fitted enough to be pushed up on my forearms yet i can pull them down past my wrists when i am chill
9543,4.0,this is my th pair of rockets theyve become my hands down favorite cut from citizens for curvy girls these are the perfect skinny jeans they come up high enough to tuck everything in no muffins top they shape and lift my butt which i need because ive got a generous one they hold their shape amazingly well and dont require a wash with every wear in order to regain their shape they truly have been the holy grail of jeans for me with all that said these are not a star version of
9544,4.0,its a good pair of ear phones due to the sound quality its on par with more expensive earphones but the great indian sale discount made it even better the packaging delivery were excellent the only small negative might be that the wire is not entirely tangle proof
9545,5.0,works just fine in my video camera in the car and i saved over bucks over best buy which always tries to rip you off
9546,4.0,decent but still flawed product dot sometimes speaks due to proximity of tv sometimes dot does not understand the question despite the simplicityamazon should come up with a direct plug in for ceiling placement as wall as a directly into the wall socket
9547,2.0,i so wanted to love this top i ordered the blue which is blue and orange i thought the orange would be brighter it is not it is a dull color also im usually a medium this top fits fine on my shouldersbust c but it was huge around the waist making me look a lot larger if this top were a bit smaller around the waist i would keep it but it is going back
9548,3.0,i saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors i went to my local store for the mothers day sale and tried it on in the blackwhite and the coralnavy i purchased both colors i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the tealwhite it fits great and is super comfortable i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly it is already pilling and doesnt seem to be holding up very well photo giv
9549,2.0,d touch not working camera quality poor very bad customer service and not replacement option
9550,5.0,this mem card is fast and does exactly what is supposed to dosave pictures quickly and have plenty of room for more
9551,4.0,everything looks amazing except when you try to use alexa as a bluetooth speaker for your phone and laptop it really struggles to play sound from mobile and laptops in short amazon needs to improve the quality of the bluetooth they are using within echo devices
9552,4.0,this top is so soft and luxuriously comfy i love wearing it around the house havent really dressed it up yet with jeans or jewelry it runs slightly big but if you like the oversized look this is definitely perfect
9553,3.0,nice product in metz inch smart tv but not upgrade letest version and not download apk file
9554,5.0,sleep tracking and data display on the app are awesome all sensors seem to be accurate notifications and music control will work as long as your phone doesnt kill the huawei health app from the backgroundyou might want to tweak the settings for the same battery lasts a week with sleep tracking on and real time heart rate monitoring off so not that bad in that department too go for it if you want a fitness band that does the job that its supposed to do even at this price
9555,2.0,processing is very slow
9556,2.0,this is not fresh piece its already used by someone else
9557,4.0,it is good as comapre to other products
9558,1.0,poor customer service fridge was delivered two days back and no one has come for installation customer care no is always busy n if you are lucky to get through there is no resolution to the issue i do not recommend bosch product at all go for lg or any other who have better service this sucks
9559,4.0,good deal on gb internal storage
9560,2.0,very weak signals not stable network tried shifting to g g which showed no signal at all after waiting for more than minutes why is that so
9561,4.0,good product with reasonable price
9562,2.0,unfortunately this dress did not work for me like the other reviews i am lbs and the dress looked like a tent on me size s there was just way too much material at the bottom also while the dress is lined both layers are quite thin not see through but i would not call them substantial either for the cost of the dress and the material it wasnt worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better
9563,1.0,i have faced bsod blue screen of death error twice within hour
9564,1.0,ver bad phone
9565,2.0,woah these jeans looked ridiculous on me i felt as though it was and i was raiding my moms closet the combination of the light wash the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no it really accentuates any pouch you may have i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering i am curvy no no no
9566,4.0,so upgrading from s to xr first reactions camera is superb loving the portrait mode interface is improved much quicker for multitasking screen resolution is much improved better battery lasts full day missing the home button missing the fingerprint sensor face recognition has a little lag thicker and heavier than s screen size of is very useful notch feels odd on deal delivery got of on hdfc cards for old honor phone day delivery under prime so great
9567,2.0,product is too badplease do not buy this battery backup is very badfrom to charge it takes only half an hour performance is very sluggishcannot rum even a mb game clash royale phone slows down eventually and front cam is very badquality is like of mp very bad oneand when i called amazon customer servicethey strictly denied for return very badwasted my rupees
9568,5.0,got in perfectly working condition perfect mobile in terms of speed cameraappsbattery backupbut packing should have been betternice experience with the seller
9569,4.0,it is good it works fine
9570,4.0,works great gave stars because the volume does not go that loud
9571,1.0,quality and price
9572,1.0,pathetic experience should not go for it its useless without remote control my remote control is not working no other remote is compatible booked remote on customer care now days has passed stil waiting for it its not eligible for one star too
9573,1.0,no front flash with camera also the it is only mp camera in front so it costly to pay for this also it has no latest google apps so it is failure for this phone unlike redmi note and buying on amazon without sale it is my guilty to purchase first time
9574,2.0,the top was very small i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top arm holes and it was short also i didnt notice if it said it was sheer see through in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath
9575,4.0,good product but the rubberpading comes of easly and bettery life is very less but perfect sound
9576,3.0,this top is very nice i ordered it in black it looked very good the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look the fabric however feels like heavy cotton it didnt feel very soft and comfortable it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton while i think this will retain its shape and not stretch like softer cotton i am sending it back it felt a bit heavy to wear
9577,2.0,everything was fine until one fateful day the laptop decided not to work when i checked with apple service centre they are telling logic board to be replaced and it costs k since i did not purchase any additional warranty neither i cannot repair this nor cannot leave just like that surprisingly the fault happened after few months of year warranty with no sign of faulty behavior until that last day if you are apple fan buy with additional warranty else buy some other laptop
9578,4.0,hitt problem mobile
9579,1.0,bad i need refund
9580,4.0,i like this top another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girli agree im a g and could have sized down to a small but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress the small may have caused slight button pulling but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut it wouldnt look insane my only issue is the fabric pills i wore the top once and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot especially for
9581,3.0,okay phone but lots of mobile software pre installed which are not needed and keeps bombarding with advertisement like kika keyboard and themes and uc browser
9582,5.0,i experienced a difficult time in getting the echo dot connected to my wit fi s

9613,1.0,its unfortunate that item received within a week turned out to be defective where other party simply cant hear my voice it seems to be working fine only with earphone resetting the phone by wiping out the data did not help issue seems to be consistent across multiple service providers sim now its with apple service center for further diagnostics even if you buy an expensive phone its not guaranteed to work and to have piece of mind this is how they manufacture defective product and make money
9614,4.0,thank goodness for a nice white basic tee that is not see through i go back and forth between an xs and s depending on how i want an item to fit i dont like things to be too form fitting because i still have a little postbaby pooch i went with a s in this shirt and it works well my only complaint is that the neckline is not totally straight where the seam comes up from under the arm to hit the neckline it bumps out a little bit but its a great nicer basic that will go well with almost

9628,2.0,i dont really understand why people think this is so great ive had echo dots for awhile now and the only thing i really use it for is to listen to music how do you actually use it to look up stuff i know that it has different skills that you are able to connect to it cat facts mixed drink recipes etc but if i ask it a general question it doesnt know anything there is no actual search engine and if i wanted something to just listen to music on i have a speaker for that can someone tell me what the point of this machine is

9634,3.0,the fabric has a beautiful drape the skirt is a nice length and it blows moves and swings in a most flattering way the gray is a an elegant color and one could definitely wear the dress at both casual and more formal events the top however sags and overwhelms the more fitted lining too bad

9643,2.0,this looks so cutebut dont be fooled it is so poofy it does not look in real life like it does on the model it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous i was so disappointed
9644,1.0,worst display and camera
9645,4.0,the product is not provided with any cd or software for manual or processing raw files and editing please check from the nearest nikon showroom before hitting the buy button on enquiry the answers of customer care are standard leaving you to contact the manufacturer otherwise a good product for beginners in photography

9651,1.0,its very slow need bill copy so that i can give it to service station near by me
9652,4.0,great product after doing the brazilian keratin treatment i was recommended to only use sulfate free shampoo and conditioners i came across organix and loved it my hair is shiny and smooth
9653,2.0,i was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friends wedding the colors looked perfect the cut was great etc very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person and sad that the slit came right to my knee which is a really weird height sadly returning might purchase again if it goes on sale and i cant find anything better before the wedding
9654,1.0,no value for money software is sloppy not enough features in phone seems like using old phone camera is useless wide capture doesnt work properly zooming is worst however selfie is just ok nothing much phone heats up like microwave display is cool os is not upto the mark vivo claims its funtouch os but actually its totally fed up os however the only good thing about phone is that it just looks good from outside but under the hood its totally useless vivo ruined it
9655,5.0,love this skirt it was on my wish list from the first time i saw it in the catalog so glad i was able to get it when it hit sales i love it thr color is more subdued than pictured but very nice anyway the cut is awesome and flatering pretty true to size for me petite winner
9656,1.0,alexa app does not have directions as stated could not connect to tv
9657,2.0,another organix product that left me disappointed this shampoo was really drying and left my hair feeling gnarly in the shower it stripped my hair yet somehow managed to leave my roots feeling greasy at the same time this was just ick for me which is a bummer because i had high hopes for it i always get sucked in by organix products because im a sucker for their cute packaging i have tried almost all of their lines and so far the only ones ive liked are the awapuhi ginger argan oil of morocco the new formula version and right now im trying their new sea mineral moisture line and liking it so far i would suggest those for anyone with hair like mine color treated dry and prone to split ends breakage
9658,2.0,itchy itchy itchy head was so itchy after using this yes it smells lovely yes bottle is pink and cute yes it is natural but my hair was a lot dryer and tangly than normal i have tried other naturalorganic shampoos natralia nourish australian organics natural intincts this was by far the least liked and most expensive give natralia a go if you are looking for natural shampoos australian made leaves your hair beautifully soft and bouncy amazing for a natural shampoo and sooo shiny as for organix yes i used up the bottle well my poor husband did but i wont buy their products again

9666,3.0,i liked my little echo i put mine in the restroom so i can listen to music when i take a bubble bath or when i wake up in the morning and wanting to know what the weather is outside i dont use my echo so much so it just sitting there the volume for this echo isnt loud enough when you are in the shower listening to music overall its a good little speaker
9667,5.0,worth of money fully detailed revised on may
9668,4.0,i wanted this jumpsuit to work so badly my regular size crushed my girls flattening them and pushing them up over the top of the jumpsuit unfortunately i had to go up dress sizes to get it to fit around my bust but was then so big that the material in the front was gapping and folding over for reference i am not overly busty a c with petite but muscular build
9669,3.0,ear plug cover fell inside the headsno service available anywerhowever worth the cost of
9670,1.0,update for the third one they sent mend gen has lots of problems at amazons end first didnt work after minutes on the help line they admitted they have a hw problem and are going to send me another groan give me a st genthe third one also would not connect to my uverse wifi my st gen in the kitchen workes fine and was a breeze to set up so another minutes on the phone with amazon and it finally connected to my wifi however when i put it in my master bath it would not connect i had to swapp it with my working st gen from the kitchen and then they finally both workedthats really weird because my kitchen is farther away and has more walls between the dot and the router so moving the nd gen dot farther away actually made it work im an electrical engineer and i cant explain that
9671,4.0,very good mobile compare with mi a very good internet connectivity with with both connections like sim and wifi sabse sastha sabse achhchha no product redmi a
9672,2.0,i had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews first off it runs really small i usually wear a small or medium or i couldnt even get the on i probably could have even done a the fabric was extremely flimsy i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off other than the sizing and the fabric it just wasnt flattering on me
9673,1.0,my iphone is slightly bent
9674,1.0,pictures quantity is sooo bad not proper smart tv very late service chinese tv
9675,2.0,i thought this would look great with skirts but all my skirts are too dressy for this tshirt thats really all it is a nothingspecial tshirt and it runs so big im usually a large or xl in tops but for this one i bought a medium and its still too big i think a small would have been fine but as i mentioned it doesnt go with any of my skirts so its not worth looking for a small
9676,5.0,bought it for my gopro hero camera silver editionworking without any problems fastwas pleasantly surprised of the good quality memory card adapter now can turn it into my laptop directly
9677,4.0,im wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways its a little long in the back because im short but overall i enjoy wearing it its comfortable casual girly and well made im happy with it
9678,1.0,very slow charging slow data transfer
9679,2.0,cannot connect to tplink kasa lightbulb
9680,3.0,this stuff smells great and the packaging is good too as far as performance goes it worked fine to tame the frizzies in my naturally wavy hair but didnt provide a lot of lift when i straightened it its a good basic mousse but dont expect much in terms of volume i found that it helped with manageability though
9681,2.0,its great for perticular use with third party accessories but by itself it can seem a little lackluster it has very limited stock features and requires more accessories to get the most use from it other than the time and weather its does work well if you have miniscule expections
9682,3.0,i was liking it very much till the time i came to know about the bandwidth support of this phone u i am now disappointed by this missing feature other than this all the features are satisfactory as compared to other phones
9683,3.0,the charge of the battery stays for days although i use an iphone so i have to charge almost thrice a day since i am constantly glued to it
9684,4.0,happy with the product good packaging
9685,1.0,a burden of keeping an extra small piece of cable if you lost it then buy yourself a new phone battery is pathetic
9686,2.0,i was expecting a tee shirt but the material is more of light sweater knit in the end it wasnt the fabric that was the deal breakerit was the fit in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body i also felt like the arms are too big as well its going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size its a shame because the embroidery really is lovely
9687,5.0,i love this dress the beading gives it something special and the petite fits my frame perfectly lightweight enough to wear now and again later with layers for fall very soft fabric
9688,2.0,useless watch
9689,5.0,i tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls i was skeptical of the simple shape but when i put on the green one i didnt want to take it offever i am and thin the small fits me perfectly i loved it so much i purchased the blue as well love love love
9690,4.0,this shampoo does a terrific job of cleansing the hair without stripping it one word of caution is the fragrance this smells strongly of mint almost like mint chocolate chip ice cream and the scent lingers although i like the smell i know tastes can runs differently as far as fragrance goes so if you dont like the smell of mint you wont like this shampoo
9691,5.0,the cut is perfect and the rose color is so pretty it fits like the typical left of center sizing i wish it came in more colors
9692,1.0,i dont know how to rate worst battery last only for a day after full charge i use it with ios phone completely useless for me as i thought to buy as a replacement from a smart watch which needs everyday charge
9693,3.0,din like the camera as i had a honor x that single camera was better then these two cameras n artificial lighting is toooo much
9694,5.0,these are my new favorite jeans the gray wash is nice and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work the rise is high enough that i dont need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button and the description is true they dont stretch im a loyal ag stevie shopper and the fit on these is similar just a little skinnier in the ankles maybe true to size a little long so ill probably hem them a couple of inches
9695,3.0,i would not recommend it for gaming just for random office work its okey
9696,2.0,this one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way did not like the way that it fit returned
9697,5.0,yes its good
9698,4.0,nice piece the fabric is very stretchy with that heavy luxe kind of feeling the neck snap placket is genius because when it is snapped up the neck stays up without restricting the throat nice long lenght too
9699,5.0,its so good in this cost other brands come in to but its ram should in gb and storage should in minimum gb because it has so much functions
9700,4.0,falls nicely pretty peachy pink color darker than pictured bought sz l lbs am busty very nice fabric prone to wrinkles
9701,2.0,phone is very slim like poor phone you can go for realme c or asus max l or lenovo in this price range
9702,5.0,i bought of these and echos
9703,2.0,its displayscrene get break after it fall from very less height only in months i lost my phone display and screen it all cracked very disappointed
9704,2.0,not happy with the product the phone gets hanged once in a while when contacted the apple service team they said its a software glitch and asked me to reset the settings still not happy
9705,5.0,i bought this in the store so i didnt know that it was actually a sleep chemise i kind of wondered if it was supposed to be a supershort dress but the salesgirl said that it was a top so i tried it on the price is shocking but im a teacher and this month july teachers get off so that helped a little bit when i tried it on i absolutely loved it maybe i look like a cupcake but im a very happy cupcake with tassels dangling from my sleeves who doesnt love tassels this is just a ve
9706,3.0,the image online doesnt depict this blouse well my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips maybe i received a flawed piece either way ill be sending it in for return
9707,4.0,not a sony xb dont expect it to be value for money good sounding buds at this price point not as bassy as sony xb series sony xb is better in terms of build quality and sound and it will cost you about double sweet highs mids are okayish lows ar okayish it tries to maintain the consumer grade smile eq curve silicone plugs are not good could have been far better at this price range i have seen better ones at lower price i am using it with a good pair of after market sony plugs if you are not spending more than k go for it
9708,2.0,having hard time connecting to my hopper and phone probably return the item back
9709,4.0,please increase the battery power resistance
9710,1.0,ugh i was so disappointed with this shirt i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they dont have a straight on photo of the shirt its very plain and lays very unflatteringly its definitely missing something in the front i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadnt returned i
9711,5.0,i got the sweater in red id call it more orange its a bit of a baggy fit not tight which i love i feel like this will be a perfect cover up for cool summer evenings i got a medium i go between small and medium and i love the fit i could have gotten a small but i liked it looser the buttons are special too
9712,5.0,bought two of these to use in a pair of galaxy s phones fit perfectly and were instantly recognized by the phones lots of room now for photos etc no problems at all thus far i have quite a few sandisk memory products including their gb ss drive all have been troublefree so i am hopeful
9713,5.0,no problem it fits and it seems fast the colors are a good addition because when it pops out on the floor or something you can find it
9714,3.0,bakwaas phone
9715,1.0,apple is cheating my phone was in rain for just minutes they say that it is water resistant but after minutes of rain when i agained open it phone was completely hanging at last when i visited cre they told me that my phone will be replace in rupees

9719,1.0,there are few points may helpful to find your right band battery works almost days for normal use days on continue heart rate check at an interval of mins hours on excercise mode only english font is supported sometimes it respond too late almost mins late this is disappointing count the step when you travel by bus bike and car band is light weight scratch resistant and fully waterproof the band is purchased a bulk in india but the band does not support hindi language purchase this if you really need it now otherwise wait and purchase a smart watch
9720,2.0,poor
9721,1.0,charging problem charger not connected
9722,3.0,i like what they were going for here and the fabric but it falls short in that i cant wear it to workthe back keyhole is massive so i cant wear my normal bras and the very wide neck also shows bra straps so unless i want to go with a strapless bra its not useful for me i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that id go without but that is a nono where i work i may try getting a size smaller i wear a med and i got a small and mayb
9723,5.0,i saw this dress in the lilac at the store and loved it immediately the picture on the website does not do it justice
9724,2.0,its come with mah battery but it charge mah battery time and nd time only half charged better to purchase it from micom not from amazon
9725,1.0,worst as expected i did a big mistake but u shud not if u read this comment then believe me even in a worst case dont buy it
9726,4.0,for someone who is into the psychology of universe being one this is a must read the power of the universe and your subconscious mind is in general a non fiction topic and mainly writers have covered it in the same genre but with alchemist i love how paulo coelho sent the same message through an amazingly wrapped around story its short and too the point every page has something and you never go thinking whats the point of including this its all important and its all worth the read
9727,3.0,i ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small i found it to be very large i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy
9728,1.0,not new set deleiver mobile is defective i go to consumer court
9729,4.0,love this shirt the material the design buti have not worn it yet the side openings are strategically placed to show my least flattening angles if you know what i mean i will be sewing these two openings and hope the shirt still looks and fits beautiful
9730,1.0,this is one the worst phonei have ever seen back camera is really very very badi did camera comparison with one power and note promp front is jus a saying please dont go for it mp camera is better than realme u camera
9731,3.0,camera quality is good but not pretty much
9732,3.0,got a speaker issue with in couple of days thanks to samsung service center issue resolved by replacing new speakers overall phone performance is good i can give
9733,1.0,totally dislike i dont know what is bad the realme company who claims that realme u qualities or the amazon who sold it this phone is too bad and they are not replace it never buy any phone online specially this one mi is much better than this realme
9734,2.0,mi a very slow working again again hanging problems speaker problem sensor problem connectivity problemnetwork camera working stopped suddenly
9735,5.0,i ordered this phone for my father initially i was doubtful about its screen performance bcz it has p resolution but i was completely surprised when i received the phone clarity and colour reproduction on the screen are very good even though it has lower resolution x pixels rear camera is average but not bad but selfie camera is awesome if u like to capture selfies and want a phone under then this phone is definitely made for u this phone also has a dedicated memory card slot so u dont have to worry about space screen consumes less power bcz of lower resolution thats why mah battery performs really well
9736,3.0,very good camera super battery life
9737,3.0,i got the dot as part of a promotion from dish tv i find it does an adequate job of that it is good at finding channels and some shows but it cant turn the system on and off and is not efficient at switching applications or understanding some names i find the alarm and the reminders functions to be very useful
9738,4.0,i usually wear a for skirts and dresses but when i got this in the mail it ended up fitting a bit snug on my hips other than that its super cute and has a great liner underneath

9746,1.0,very very bad
9747,3.0,i agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it
9748,1.0,i had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that ive received this dress im appalled by all the positive reviews this dress is hideous in person seriously hideous and even if you can get past the drapery fabric its incredibly restricting the picture online is so misleading the dress isnt even an ivory its more of a pea green so disappointed
9749,2.0,i have used the iphone for over weeks now and i feel the s plus is a faster phone than the i should have bought a s instead or a plus i didnt fee worth the moti spent i feel sad about it and if i get an opportunity to upgrade to a plus i would be happy to
9750,3.0,i have the echo hooked up to phillips hue and for the most part works great but thus ai could definitely use improvement i got to say alexa dim the lights like or times when id rather just say alexa dim the lights all the way and to increase the light intensity i got to say increase the lights so un natural and when i say turn up the lights she turns them off good product but siri back in seems smarter then alexa at times
9751,4.0,nice but i thought these ran big me waist hips athletic thighs usually a medium in leggings but these size mediums were a bit baggy to my surprise hoping to exchange for a size down as they are pretty the ankle detail is fun and decently made
9752,3.0,i love this skirt and wish i could keep it but it is not for the vertically challenged i am lbs and the medium petite was about in too long even with wedges my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return boo
9753,2.0,phone is too slow using more ram than expected when i am using amazon app iy says gb of gb available facing lagging issue battery performancebackup is pathetic mot even lasting for complete day on normal use of internet hanging a lot would not recommend it to anyone amazon i need my money back please provide the return assistance
9754,2.0,the product is ok but speaker did not work from day i cannot understand how such a basic defect gets even pushed out btw i was delivered a non booting laptop st up and amazon promptly replaced a new one but it has the speaker issue
9755,5.0,first words fab its a best buy to feel music water resistance is far more than better bass will butter ur heads literally just ignore the fir of the ear supporters there cuz they fall off at times when we r too harsh in fitting them into our ears

9767,5.0,i am most pleased with this tunic purchased it in red nice quality and very comfortable casual top it has a flattering cut that isnt boxy for a long tunic so its flattering the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesnt add any bulk which is a bit slimming it would work well for a wide variety of body types i may buy the blue as well
9768,3.0,fine product but not worth the price
9769,3.0,for the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back would have been a classier more finished looking garment if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look
9770,4.0,the waist is a little high and large and this causes gapping in the smalloftheback area very cute dress if it fit well would probably work on someone less curvy p lbsc for reference

9777,2.0,i usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived the fabric smelled plasticy which is a first for me with retailer products when i put the shirt on i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts i hadnt noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores i cant believe retailer is selling this

9783,3.0,i have a love hate relationship with this product it is comfortable and cozy yet unshapely after the initial wear the product begins to stretch out and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand the sherpa front is soft but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely but i would never leave the house with this on i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too i am typically a
9784,5.0,works fine answers quick questions when i am in a hurry like the weather sport scores and news headlines
9785,2.0,they have given in specification that it will have ms office windows in built but it doesnt contains ms office i would suggest not to buy any laptop online
9786,3.0,ahhh i should have listened to previous reviews indeed this top runs very large style wise it is ok i would say you could do much better at retailer
9787,5.0,superb phone got with extra discount and having superb build battery camera and not least android one
9788,4.0,if amazon give chance to replace item will return
9789,2.0,these felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs an alternative would be to clip the elastic but ultimately decided to return
9790,1.0,worst phoneworst service
9791,4.0,really pretty for summer especially beach and pool wear but im only and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats which is my preferred shoe for this dress im also curvy and busty on top so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist its not as flattering as the tall thin model shows but still it looks nice on and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too so im on the fence about keeping it since its really pretty for a summer party
9792,5.0,so far so good bot it on dec
9793,1.0,bad picture no control for colors and sound is worst appears as it from mobile no bass treble tv is dull bad service

9795,2.0,product is hanging while in conference call and its doesnt connect to hotspot
9796,2.0,came to this phone after selling my google pixel xl which was a great phone on its own but wanted to see what the fuss is about ios and apples better app ecosystem and all that my main comparison of this phone will remain with the pixel positives first top class build quality the phone looks solid feels solid finishing of the product is top notch taptic engine vibration motor of a phone is a hugely important thing and this phone has the best vibration i have ever experienced no android flagship phone i have used has anywhere near the intensity or quality reminds me of the olden days of them nokia phones with huge vibration motor inside them great job there hands down camera is good in low light especially noise are kept well in control overall the camera cant beat pixel cant beat a lot of other phones anyway but its a good camera especially for someone who used to use dlsrs for long time to appreciate natural less saturated output and video quality is tremendously good though the front camera is awful i almost never use it but coming from a pixel it felt like having a vga front camera fingerprint reader is in the best position in front and it works every time smoothness well smoothness is good definitely much less frame drops overall across the ui than pixel but not to an extent where it could make significant difference anyway ram management excellent for a phone having gigs of ram well i can only laugh at android where pixel reloaded apps with double ram this thing can apps in memory battery life very good for a tiny sized battery i am getting hours of sot with hours of standby time raw speed needless to say anything about the a chipset it chews graphically demanding games and apps like nothing there simply is no android phone which can come anywhere close now the negatives which outdo the positives for my usage most impractical and unintuitive os i have ever experienced the scrolling mechanism is stupid you cant scroll fast up or down it will stuck at a point so you will get tired and it misses some touches in the process to waste of time free flow scrolling for life then there is no system wide back option this will drive you bonkers if you are coming from android every app is different where most apps do have the gesture support of left to right to go back to previous screen its still nowhere near as fast as simply hitting a back button and on some apps there simply is no gesture support like paytm for example and the back button is located on top left corner which you cant reach with one hand and i am using the smaller version of the phone you can touch the home button twice to activate a reduced sized display of current screen but it goes away as soon as you do something which requires to move to another screen ridiculous beyond explanation also there is no share option to other apps like snapseed or drive or google photos directly from the native photos app another time wasting thing there is no t support on the native dialler rofl call quality i dont know but i just dont like the call quality especially when i am coming from a phone which had brilliant call quality sar value dont know how it could be that absurdly high check gsmarena specs scary really no fast charging this simply should be here even this smaller battery takes full two hours to charge fully lol thats it basically when this phone works for a lot of people who think that this phone is miles ahead in terms of whatever probably for the fruit logo at back side this was simply not for me absolutely ridiculous amount of time i wasted trying to do simple things i never did care about the apple logo god knows which type of people care about that so for me i need something which is much more practical much more intuitive and which wont drive me bonkers for simple stuffs so yeah that was apple for me best of luck regards saurav
9797,3.0,camera quality very badsound quality gud
9798,2.0,i so wanted to love this tank and was so excited to get it in the mail i got a size small my usual and it ran so large i wasnt even sure an xs wouldve fit properly the material looked lighter and blousey on the model but in person is much thicker and sort of hangs underarms run large and are gaping from the body i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it but it just cant work on me
9799,3.0,i wish this fit more to the body it really does flare out a lota adding volume to the person wearing it the mustard color is beautiful so is the pink i ordered both to compare but the was still big on me and p so i passed fabric is light for summer so if you are thin not muscular perhaps that would look great
9800,1.0,very bad phone
9801,3.0,i enjoy the brand organix for the most part i have super straight hair thats oily but prone to getting frizzy it cleaned my hair and smelled amazing but my hair didnt feel super soft or get very shiny if you want a clean that doesnt strip id advise it if you want super soft and shiny hairnot so much
9802,2.0,just think twice before you buy this phone which criteria is required for you in phone for performance camera this phone will not suit or match the money spent on this if u r redmi user you wont feel like using a phone which matches redmi better with blind fold you can buy realme xt bills quality is not good back bukit in case is worst overall you can choose the company or brand which suits ur need user interface is different unwanted built in apps scrap no notification light no pocket mode speakers are not good no screen finger print the features are very low compared to redmi then realme xt hits the row and we will get satisfied for the money spent on phone
9803,4.0,the burgundy and black dress is stunning on beautiful cut and colors i think i do need the petite however the material is not as stretchy as other dresses but the dress does keep its shape
9804,1.0,fingerprint does not work in mobile mobile hangs a lot redmi is the most useless mobile of redmi i think but camera quality is right battery is also right
9805,5.0,good handset
9806,5.0,this top is so pretty i would say its probably about size smaller than normal but i like the cropped fit
9807,2.0,the wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering quality was excellent denim was thick with the right amount of stretch unfortunately they had to go back
9808,4.0,its going to be quite useful
9809,4.0,i just received my echo dot and preparing it for use was going well when i tried connecting it to my wifi the alexa app told me to go to settings on my phone and uncheck smart network switch and retun to alexa app when done there is no uncheck smart network identified in the settings so i am not able to move forward to connect to wifi please help what do i do now
9810,1.0,i havent received the mobilei have ordered mobile i have received only i have done the payment for three
9811,2.0,this phone is worthless its battery is poor its camera is below average and service by amazon is worst i am trying to return but they are not accepting the return and just averting me
9812,2.0,phone getting hot while playing a small game battery is draining very quick and touch is worst then worst jaisa paisa waisa model
9813,2.0,material is awful not soft at all colors are much darker than shows online it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model it went back
9814,3.0,simple device with adequate sound quality and battery backup definitely worth the price love the ease of use during workouts
9815,4.0,the length is lovely the color is nice the fabric feels like silk but isnt so you can wash it and the cut is flattering if youre a b cup or below for me the pleats on top made my chestiness look like fattiness
9816,5.0,love this dress the other reviews were accurate it is a lot of fabric and i cant decide whether i will actually use the belt that it came with but i think it would be a great beachy dress for the summer
9817,3.0,the fit is a bit loose in the body more than you can tell on the model more like a true swing style top i feel the arms are a good fit but i ordered one size up from my normal since im planning to wear this as a maternity top arms are definitely a size smaller than the body the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd but overall i still like it the cutout notch at the collar is super cute plus the green color of this top is lovely and i love that its made in the usa so ill be keeping
9818,4.0,speed squeaks in at a bare minimum of a class good for tablets and smartphones wouldnt recommend it for picture or video cameras
9819,3.0,i like design of the dress softness and color i got grey the dress is shorter on me then on model lbs i got m fits ok but i dont like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time despite i got it with discount it will come back as its poor quality
9820,5.0,lightweight slim and great performance but be careful all metal back slips like a fish
9821,1.0,vary bad product give me dammged internal product mother board is low quilicty
9822,1.0,the speed which is expected is not delivered in system and product looks of old techanology and taking too much time to start or opening anything not worth the money for office purpose
9823,1.0,facing too much performance issue taking alot time to reboot i didnt try to open any excel files or docs but usual performance seems like a disaster
9824,1.0,it stop working after days of usases
9825,2.0,at i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off the colors are so pretty for summer but there is just too much fabric i felt like i was wearing a giant doily however there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this
9826,5.0,this is a good quality phone at a good price
9827,4.0,i am tall and and mostly leg with a shorter torso so i am always looking for longer shirts to balance my leg to torso ratio i ordered this in the tan and blue colors in a large and so far have loved both of them i am typically a medium in tops but tend to get the large for the extra length and have the top altered to fit if need be however there was no need to alter these tops making me think the tops typically run small both tops are sheer requiring a tank of some sort to b
9828,4.0,i am using this phone since past months it is working well it met my expectations certain features i am unable to understand but it is a value for money in its class
9829,5.0,little bit tough but its need for competitive exams good
9830,3.0,all good at this rate
9831,2.0,i ordered two sizes when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin both shirts were in the bag the style is just okay the shirt is extremely light weight i was not impressed with the fabric i am returning both definitely did not think it was worth the price
9832,5.0,this sandisk brand is one of the most accurate and secure for sd memory cards i recommend it for sure
9833,2.0,sound quality is bad as the speakers are facing the ground due to slim design
9834,4.0,these jeans are wellmade the cut is decently flattering but on more muscular thighs it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher the petite on me was just below the ankle so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long if you are taller or have longer legs mine are short on my short height then i think these would be great i dindt find them particularly small but htey were snug muscular thighs overall ok but returning them p ordered lbs in
9835,3.0,sandisk makes a lot of claims about this card and some of them are questionable i own two and while the highcapacitylowprice certainly makes them useful theyre not the answer to all of my recording needs first of all do not use this with a gopro hero or later model despite sandisks claims these cards cannot handle the demands of true hd recording gopro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off even with mycanon vixia hf flash memory high definition camcordertechnology which is over years oldthe sandisk ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in fxp mode x mbps even though the camera says only a class is required a firmware update to the gopro fixed the issue for hero and hero cameras but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards ie lowering the quality of the recording slightlythose shortcomings aside the sandisk ultra can shoot in xp mode x on the vixia hf and it works with all of the settings of acontourroam waterproof hd p is it waterproof temperature proof xray proof shock proof i cant say the contourroam is a waterproof camera so even nonwaterproof cards are safe for submersion if theyre in the housing the ultra has functioned in weather and after being dropped so theres validity to the claim of it being temperature and shockproof i guess ill find out whether its xrayproof the next time i go through the airport
9836,2.0,not satisfied disturbance occurs when we are playing games or on call the other person cant hear us properly service centre is also too far for me to visit and get repaied
9837,4.0,definitely a good product but a little bit costly
9838,5.0,the best selfie camera till date tried for a brief moment as i had ordered this phone for a friend and found the device to be exceptionally good better still is the display with a waterdrop notch that looks terrific the blue colour ordered looks royal in sunlight additional value provided in the form of a screen protector pre installed in addition to a back cover brilliant

9843,2.0,i agree with the other reviewers that this runs big unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back i love the lyocell material i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesnt look right it is not as pictured as well the skirt i received is a medium blue denim not the lovely light blue as pictured another reason why i am returning

9846,3.0,bought this early in the season probably washed and worn times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottombummer
9847,2.0,i dont love it the speaker is terrible awful i can pair it to bluetooth speakers but then again i could just pair my phone to the speakersi also dont love that i have to buy a prime music membership to be able to play music on it prime music used to be included in your membershipi dont understand why its not portable i would love to be able to move it from one room to the other to use it as a morning alarm but it has to stay plugged in in the living room to be of any use to me at allit definitely does not do enough to be worth the price tag particularly when its stationary and has poor sound quality
9848,1.0,there are numerous self help books far better than this this doesnt create interest in the readers please dont buy this
9849,3.0,its a great tv and a very good display the sound is just ok not clear at higher volumes the biggest problem is it will show that you have gb free but when you will try to install th or th app you will get the error insufficient storage i looked into the filesystem and found that they have allocated only gb even a little less for the apps also its running on kitkat which is quite old now they played it smartly so that people dont install many apps which will slow down the tv its better to buy a nonsmart tv and buy amazon firestick additionally secondly the whole menu is a kind of apps that means if the android operating system crashes or even if the cpu or the memory gets some problem you wont be able to see the regular tv too on the pros all the entertainment applications like hotstar netflix amazon prime youtube etc works well without any lag
9850,1.0,over all the product is nice but battery backup is horrible it hardly last for hours while playing game i bought this to play pubg but unfortunately i am not able to enjoy it i wish to return it

9853,3.0,jbl go is a good budget buy the material is quite reliable and battery life is also decent its base is very good its perfect for edm only negative is that its volume is not that high if you are in a room than its good but you need to find better alternative of you are looking for speakers to used while trekking or outdoors
9854,4.0,after reviewing the comments for this dress i was really hesitant about buying it online so i finally went to the store and all of the reviews are true this dress is amazing in terms of quality but the sizing makes zero sense im normally a size but based on the reviews i initially tried on a medium even that was huge arm holes so long you could see my entire bra so i tried on the small and that fit perfectly unfortunately unless youre normally an maybe or above in sizing
9855,2.0,i really love the pattern and the look on the model and i thought i would love it i ordered online so i did not try on in store when i tried it on it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt it is thick fabric as well and has a lining and the waist has extra fabric for the design and it has pockets so it all adds up to be way too bulky it is not flattering at all and made me look pounds heavier i am returning this dress sad because it looks so lovely on the model i am

9860,1.0,i dont get this mobile
9861,5.0,i was a little afraid to order this dress online but my local store only had a small left so i jumped hoping the fabled net would appear and it did this might be my favorite retailer dress thus far i ended up buying a large due to the fear of the front being too short it was a good call im sure a medium would have fit up top but i have longer legs and i know i wouldnt have felt comfortable in a mediums length plus i tend to like the oversized look i paired it with some slouchy socks and
9862,4.0,i purchased this top online love the off the shoulder trend and this looked like it would be perfect for fall nice fabric and lace detail but the top definitely runs big i ordered an xl and it was beyond swimming on me definitely order a size or two down also it is very long tunic length i love a tunic but it almost wore more as a dress than a top overall cute item and fabric but definitely order down
9863,3.0,sound is not so good and also build in quality is low
9864,1.0,this card was used in a phone without a large amount of write stress which does shorten the life of the card it was not written to over and over in the phonethe card is now totally unwriteable on a mac a linux machine or the phone writes all seem to succeed but even lowlevel reformats dont actually do anything the exact same files are there after every change untouchable and frozen forever months of use out of a memory card and then a really weird failure like this neither the mac linux machine or phone reports any error is not acceptable quality from sandisk

9869,3.0,i fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me it is kind of a thick linencottony material and just didnt lay down well bunching out on the sides in a way i didnt find to be very flattering so stars for print and whimsy and charm but stars for actual fit on alas it is going

9874,4.0,i loved this shirt online and went to my local retailer store the other day and wanted to try it on i didnt even get past the hold it up and measure the length test we tall people often do as it was incredibly short there is no way i could wear this shirt at unless you have a short torso and want to rock the icky highwaisted pants that are everywhere right now this beautiful top might not work for you oh and its sheer camisole needed for white and navy
9875,2.0,this shirt aesthetically is very pleasing i love the overall design and colors however when i tried it on i was immediately itchy the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be in addition though i ordered a size medium it fit very large almost too oversized the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big its too bad i really loved the look but im not the type to layer if you are go for it but get a size smaller than you normally would
9876,5.0,i absolutely love this shirt i saw it in the retailer store and immediately knew i had to have it all they had in stock was a size and a size im usually a in buttonup shirts but i tried the anyway and found it to be quite generously sized i have a dd bust so buttonup shirts rarely fit me properly this one was big enough to be comfortable worn out or tucked in and was loosefitting without being sloppy when i discovered that it came in petite sizes i asked the so to order t

9883,3.0,these jeans fit perfectly however the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic
9884,4.0,the picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric the cut is aline trapezoidshaped the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides the cut works with pants mostly you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such the fabric has a quality of freshly starched pleasant surprise it lacks softness of leisure
9885,5.0,i want one for every room im so happy i finally purchased one
9886,3.0,i ordered the pink in size xl the color was pretty the problem is the material was too thin and tight it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online

9888,1.0,this dress turned out to be a huge disappointment i was in loveee with the picture in real life not so much the material felt thin and cheap and the yellow was super yellow nothing like the picture i was so bummed returned it earlier today
9889,2.0,this is huge i understand thats the style but it looked like i was wearing my husbands size xxl i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice but then it started to itch and itch and itch

9893,4.0,a successful first date sweater the cut is flowy so dont expect snug the quality is average for retailer sweaters i guess nothing will ever be pillfree the detailing at the bust reveals a little of what lies beneath which in my case was just a bra but in more conservative environs might have to be a camisole
9894,2.0,when i saw this item online i ordered it right away loved the color and the oversized comfy look to it the pros very softthe color a deep cranberry as pictured the cons the low back in the photo the models arms cover it up when i put it on it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front and because the material is unstructured that made it look worse i loved it except for this one feature but because it was so detracting i had
9895,3.0,speakers are worst
9896,4.0,let me begin by saying i own quite few pilcro jeans the script and hyphen to name a few absolutely love them they fit tts super soft with just the right amount of stretch the em jean have the perfect retro look super soft with just enough relaxed fit to still look stylish unfortunately i noticed that they have gone up in price a bit since they were introduced as the signature jean for retailer andddddd they are no longer made in the usa but in chinaso you may need to try on

9905,3.0,thank u realme
9906,2.0,i thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style but i returned it immediately it runs so large the colors are faded and the trim of the shirt curl over so it looks cheap and frumpy i do not recommend this it hits in all the wrong places

9910,4.0,using the card for videos and music have already filled it up and it works great playing back my media
9911,3.0,really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece unfortunately because i have ample hips the skirt just made me look very wide overall in addition i am short at so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter
9912,1.0,overheating issue poor battery backup lack of fast changing very poor device
9913,1.0,very bad plse resolved my issue regarding this order contact me asap

9915,2.0,i ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length i dont know if the length stated is from a size m but the small was definitely shorter in the front at least if youre petite with curves like me its not a flattering cut
9916,5.0,ordered this as a gift she said it is great nice fabric great fit
9917,2.0,i have long thick slightly wavy hair and it is not been chemically treated but it is dry and has split ends i was recommened macademia oil and with my good experience with the moroccan argan oil mist i decided to try this conditioner out now this one is suppose to moisturise with macademia oil and treat the split ends with the help of sugar cane when i used it and washed it off i felt it had no effect and it left a sort of residue in my hair it has a great smell but i dont think it has any effect on me and thats disappointing
9918,3.0,vivo funtouch os sucks itna ghatiya i have desi gaaliyan for it only battery life is not more than a day with youtube and internet surfing onlyand i think fingerprint sensor is not good no matter what is the pricing of the phone its not in screen fingerprint sensor after all so it could be betterand loud speaker is also ok not upto the mark my previous phone moto g has great loudspeaker in it

9921,2.0,please note that i am putting my pathatic review after using the phone for last days i dont know how gadget gurus make people fool with fake biased review once purchase there is no refund if you dont like the product the camera is pathetic a bellow k phone is far better than mp triple camera pictures in low lights not a single picture you will like to keep after taking snaps the speaker sound is not even clearly audio able in home itself very low sound you have to make pindrop sound silence to hear the sound the micro phone does not picks up sound with a little distance please dont become a pray of marketing skills of amazon for selling samsung mobiles
9922,3.0,works great lots of fun
9923,1.0,phone getting heat while charging
9924,5.0,i purchased this to put into my samsung galaxy blaze mainly to store music i previously owned an adata gb card which died after a couple weeksthe most annoying thing about large storage is copying files to it especially when the card is slow a class would take well over hours to fill up while this one takes just a bit over minutesusing the antutu benchmark suite this card clocked in at mbs write and mbs readi didnt have to format it or anything just popped it out of the packaging and threw it right into the sd slot of my phone
9925,2.0,beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined sort of like heavy drapes also the length as others mentioned was too long i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long unfortunately it has to go back
9926,3.0,i would give it a if half star possible like other reviews said the material is a little cheap and back zip got stuck when i tried to unzip it before trying it on overall nice color and flattering look that could be dress up or down i am lbs b and m is a little snug for me on the top

9930,2.0,the photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides and just below her hair there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat well its not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater bummer ill be returning it
9931,1.0,battery is very bad up log is phone ko math khareadea very very very bad battery hai is ph ka
9932,3.0,when it works as intended it is terrific however when it doesnt it is so frustrating you want to throw it out the window the big problem as i see it is keeping the supporting components like bulbs switches outlets etc meshed with echo the technology has come a very long way and for the price it is absolutely amazing but it still has a long way to go
9933,2.0,hanging problem
9934,1.0,at first i wondered amazon doing merely impossible with this festival sales and i myself felt proud to get iphone at including amazon pay balance with card offer included i had some issues with phone signal all the time and i used to blame my network for it phone used to get hang some times and i blamed the number of apps i use bluetooth reception is very weak i got bose sound sport and even exchanged that saying bluetooth not working properly but this signal problem daunted me soo much and i once contacted online service center who mailed me self help guides for checking my phone working condition and its completely fine but one day i walked to a service center where in a glance they said my phone is having a screen which is a kind of first copy i was completely speechless then i submitted my phone for signal issue and they said they cant cover it in warranty and i need to change the mother board which is i told them the price at which i got it is then i was lucky that discussion didnt went in a heated fashion and the manager over there was considerate and got it checked in first place he said the piece is completely fake and in first place he believed me that i didnt fraud on him and sent the piece to apple service center banglore he also told me that its refurbished and its fault of seller let the company take a decision and then we can claim from amazon based on the letter from company and original invoice luckily the piece was replaced with a brand new one the signal reception is fantastic now the phone is liquid smooth and now i can feel the apple brand value eventhough i could thank appario retail private limited that because of them i could get a new iphone with improved battery life at no cost i want to bring it to all your notice that these sales are a way to clear a lot of fault stock returned items which do not perform well and a lot of copied products which you cant catch easily with naked eye seller appario retail private limited holds responsible in my case for sending me a fake copied product which only service center professionals could catch and not all service centers are same and they may think we are cheating and can even throw us out please be mindful of products you purchase and get it checked in service center if you are buying something at mindblowing price particulary during sales p

9955,4.0,i originally bought this in a medium for reference i am lbs it was tiny i sent it back for a large and it fits beautifully the fabric is incredibly soft and the dress is very flattering and comfortable i would just recommend ordering up a size
9956,4.0,been on the hunt for jammies so gave these a shot ordered my normal size large fit well in the waist but i dont like the super wide legs and theyre too long pretty color and pattern however the fabric isnt as soft or cozy as i hoped im retired and wanted pajamas to lounge in all day these missed the mark for me

9967,4.0,battery is ok but mobile sound not good
9968,2.0,i really wanted to love this shirt the fit was great and the fabric just felt beautiful luxurious soft and flowing but the collar was frayed in addition the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship i put it aside to return it then this morning went to have another look at it wanting to talk myself back into it but i cant overlook the fact id be ordering a new shirt that would look timeworn it may be only this
9969,2.0,i was working with a three of these cards using the included adapter and thought they were slower than they should be i just bought a full size sandisk ultra gb class all the same specs except size theoretically for a different project and it writes over twice as fast on the same computer the write speed on this card is between and mbs the read seems to be mbs compared to the full size card with write speed of to mbs and a read speed of mbs this is from an imaging program not a benchmark program so its not checking different sizes of transfer and the like compare that with a transcend gb class card the write speed is nearly identical to mbs while the read speed on the class four is to mbs significantly slower as expectedthe read speed is good but the write speed is abysmal if it says class it should be somewhat close to the class specim returning them
9970,1.0,dont buy thisworst
9971,2.0,nojust no this shampoo is horrible for my hair i bought it because im on a hunt for a good sulfate free shampoo loreals everpure shampoo caused a lot of hair fallout so i tried this one after i rinsed the shampoo out i couldnt believe what a poof of tangles my hair was i hoped that the matching conditioner would detangle my hair i had to apply it to my root area which is a big nono for fine hair like mine but my hair was such a tangled mess i needed conditioner from root to tip i wasnt happy about that and thought about what a limp mop my hair would be even worse when i rinsed the conditioner out after leaving it on for a few minutes my hair was still tangly and felt like straw so i applied my trusty nioxin conditioner which completely detangled it but i had to apply it to the roots again for some reason i still had hope for the shampoo thinking if i gave my hair enough time to adjust to it it would begin to work better for two weeks i continued the process of shampooing applying the conditioner root to tip after my hair continued to get extremely tangled from the shampoo then using my nioxin conditioner after the organix one didnt help after no improvements in two weeks i dont knowcare if itll ever work ill hold on to the conditioner cause it might work with a better shampoo as far as my hair turned out afterward when i let it air dry it actually wasnt bad it looked really shiny and silky but with all the conditioner i have to use its just not worth it after my bad experiences with sulfate free shampoos i might just go back to normal shampoo gave this product two lipped because it smells amazing and since its sulfate free it would be a good alternative to normal shampoos if it works for someone else
9972,3.0,i tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs both were ridiculously wide they were also both cut really short the peplum basically started right below my boobs though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex the stripes are really cute the cut is just very strange for reference the black and white is the small the taupe is the xxs
9973,3.0,overall quality of the fone is good working of the fone is also good one lacking there is no memory card slot so if you wants to expand memory is not possible battery life of the fone is just hrs we have to keep a power bank along if anyone wants to have more battery life this is not the fone to be used
9974,4.0,bought this mainly because i did not like note and note pro size this phone is having hybrid sim which does not affect much these days as more often than not many of us use handsets only thing that irritates me as of now is that this product is made not available within few months of getting released this marketing strategy is not helping us as when we go for repairing parts are not available thus egarbage getting piled up at home
9975,2.0,i looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money i wear a size p was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on thick and heavy the overall fit was too big and very unflattering
9976,4.0,i passed this over on first sight because it looked like it might be on the short side in length after seeing a few other photos and reading the reviews i opted to give it a go the store did not have my usual xs or even a size small so i tried on the medium it was too wide as expected but the shoulders are adjustable so i fiddled with it a bit and decided it was really cute there were no more xs available to order so i asked if the store could order the small it arrived and is absolutely
9977,4.0,purchased in white very pretty top i thought it would be more lace but non the less it is lovely
9978,2.0,dont waste money
9979,1.0,i wanted to believe that those people who wrote bad reviews on memory cards were just unlucky well it sucks being one of them i cannot get this card to format not matter what device software or technique i use the mistake i made was that i didnt use the card right away to see if it was good i thought its a memory card what could go wrong now im out of the us and returning it is not economically sensible i dont know if its quality control but this card simply cannot work in any reader device with or without adapter write protection off on the reader of course the card shows up on devices may even show data being copied then when you refresh nothing has happened all formatting software says its write protected and nothing i do can remove it why would a new card come write protected anyway very disappointing especially since i lost data from my phone
9980,5.0,this sweater is buttery soft and warm it is long and you will want every color i bought the sky blue and it looks fabulous with so many outfits i had to get the gray color also the sleeves are a soft fitted rib material and the body is long and roomy love love
9981,5.0,good phone my dream phone good product made by mi
9982,2.0,its been two month and the problem is from starting itself sound is major issue u can not talk calmly over the callevery call u have to speak loudly then only the other side person will hear ubattery life is very short in a day u have charge phone twiceoverall i would say dont buy this phonerather go for other brands
9983,2.0,at first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because in person the shirt fits like a circus tent without exaggeration there is a surplus of about inches the material is still beautiful and because of that i havent decided whether ill return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner more fitted shape
9984,3.0,comparing it to my oneplus pro what a joke this phone is no dout the software if much better but the hard ware is straight up garbage expect that a bionic
9985,1.0,mobile is not working properly there is the issue while phone rings and after every call to pick up call needs to be switch on and off mob than only its possible to pick up a call
9986,4.0,nice recommended
9987,1.0,nothing is to like rather than colour not happy with the product waste of money after little fluctuations fridge is not starting
9988,4.0,i love the style of this dress but felt that it didnt look great on really sad it didnt work out felt like it was too short and the drop waist was awkward and looked childish beautiful fabric and design if it fits you well though
9989,4.0,such an excellent product with best camera performance but front cam isnt upto the mark in terms of selfieotherwise its a very good phone on this budget with excellent battery backup and display quality also very goodso whoever looking for a phone under k you can go with this beast
9990,1.0,amazon is not satisfying the customer and is only interested to make more and more money i bought this phone from amazon and days earlier it had been delivered and when unpacked and unboxed i checked all the details and found that the back side at fingerprints side something was wrong and then i closely inspected then i found scratches on my new phone and while using i found the fingerprint was not working correctly and was not responding or even vibrating on touch and after some use found that there was update and it was stated that after update the fingerprint will be working properly after updating and wasting gb of my internet i found that the option of fingerprints is missing from the settings option full disgusting customer satisfaction from amazon
9991,2.0,these pants look beautiful when you first see them it goes downhill from there the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants it felt fine when pulled up but it is a struggle i could get past that but when i looked in the mirror i could see right through them no lining and not very thick material for this price a real bummer especially since it was a birthday gift
9992,3.0,this trench is beautiful with a lovely swinging skirt that adds a romantic sense of drama and movement youll feel as though you are starring in your very own film noir movie i wish i could have kept it but i couldnt justify paying full price on a coat that had to be handwashed the label specifies no dry cleaningthere is a lot of fabric on this trench and i imagine that all those little pleats will have to be ironed too i dont have the time for that and for this much money i wou
9993,3.0,i couldnt wait to get this dress from the online order the fabric looked so interesting to me linen appliqu pockets raw neckline the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion its like a little a line tent the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head im going to return it and try for a medium for reference i am and usually wear a six or a small
9994,1.0,i ordered this few days ago played only dragon ball fighterz for few couple of dayswas ready to play big games but all of a sudden it goes black and only keyboard red light was on neither keyboard was working nor screen was working replacing the laptop on the last date of replacement luckilyi realized that i have bought a piece of crap inr means a lot for a budget family asus sucks and so do the retailers and manufacturers
9995,3.0,first of all the label on this dress is maeve not nue by shani second i just wasnt impressed the fabric is coolit has a sort of embossed look to it and its somewhat shiny which sets it apart in a good way but the cut is just boring the top felt dowdy to meoverall i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it
9996,3.0,used it for the first couple of days just stopped using it afterwards
9997,4.0,very good features considering it costs infact best phone under k
9998,4.0,battery life is less than my previous mi note initially it would hang and restart alot after one update that has been fixed however still slower than note
9999,3.0,this shirt is absolutely beautiful however it runs very small proportionwise its okay in the shoulders bust and back but its too short definitely order up
10000,1.0,noise cancellation is very bad dont buy this earphone
10001,4.0,good camera and good performance
10002,5.0,i was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse in pink in the store it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond in true floreat style it is well made and unique id say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit
10003,3.0,i have a curvy figure and this top is not for me it fits loose at the top and is tight at the bottom it is also short i think this top works best on slender figures
10004,1.0,very poorly made wide and short very unflattering the material is advertised as cotton but it felt very synthetic
10005,5.0,good product total value for money
10006,3.0,dear readers the look is good theres no call recorder the picture loses its clarity when zoomed its not offering mp quality the phone call voice sound from the other end is very low the phone heats up during a long call and during charging redmi a has not met the primary needs of the user according to the claims they made and the money they charged however the look and the display is good

10008,3.0,when i received this tank i ordered the blue i almost returned it because it seemed really thin almost see through however once i tried it on it had a good fit not see through just lightweight and breezy i especially like the twisted details on the straps i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort especially because it is on the thin side

10032,2.0,love the color and overall design of this dressbut its just going to have to go back the view from the direct front and back are nice but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant not the look im going for especially at this price the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed in the back its all i see which is right on a bullseye and the same on the front i dont know how the designer missed this its the only white design on th

10034,2.0,this was so unflattering the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs the green was a beautiful vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag
10035,3.0,gorgeous fun dress but the cut in the armholes petite is really low so low even a strapless bra peeks above it there are also lining issues could have been with just my one choice where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much back is stunning i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome it didnt work for my body because i have to wear a bra but i think its a winner for someone

10043,4.0,i received this for christmas this year and have already worn it several days in a row it is warm enough to wear while walking the dog in the snow and can also be worn to lounge around the house the only reason i didnt rate it a is due to the design fact that it doesnt have pockets i dont love to carry a purse around all of the time so i use my coat pockets a lot regardless though i would definitely recommend this especially for the price i was expecting to come here and see this pric

10077,4.0,charger seems to be used or refurbished it has scratches on it when i opened so thumbs down for the seller about the product i had tough time deciding when compare this with nikon d kit lens they cost the same gives greater flexibily and value for money but is the latest with few advanced features at last i felt to keep bcoz of following reasons amazing compactness and light weight less photo processing lag compared to in live view takes hell of time has better video performance and records lot of motor noice during videoespecially being afs afp lens makes reasonably less noice touch screen and more battery life with lastly snapbridge capability though i had trouble connecting initially once connected its nice feature though not a deciding factor better iso performance at higher iso and takes lovely low light pictures
10078,4.0,i like photo clarity but battery backup low
10079,4.0,phone is greatno doubt value for moneythe battery lasts for less than hours for medium usage camera is ok okprocessor exynos is excellent can handle games like pubg without any lag the screen is just excellentits really awesome sound is also good but more on a treble side than bassbut in earphone dolby atmos works greatand sounds excellent the best part about samsung is its customer service either via phonechat or service centeryou wont find any difficulties on this the software optimisation is the best in this phoneand you will feel like you are using a premium phone cons minor software lag at the notch areawill be fixed in next update no bixby no secure folder no knox protection no samsung pay mini slow security patch n software update this are some basic features which samsung must have given and many can be given via software update will update if find anything else soon
10080,2.0,fits large wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price
10081,5.0,this is one great button up shirt the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters with a came underneath or all on its own the fabric could be a bit thicker i am between a small and a medium a or an and bought this in a small
10082,2.0,im a short girl but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer for me i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered this shirt is adorable love the details i wanted it so bad which is why i paid so much for a basic tshirt still it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or vneck to break up the dots
10083,3.0,quickly went bad i used it for maybe weeks better keep your receipt too bad i didntbad deal period
10084,2.0,couldnt make it work even belted ivory color is darker irldingy light tan like dirty vintage drop waist is not dropped at all just a maternityish cut that starts boxyloose high up below bust then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level not low hip into the skirt i usually find aline cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy curvy waist but this does notadds ten pounds poly fabric heavyhot rayon lining awkward and doesnt flowdrape lb a tried xs
10085,3.0,the sweater is beautiful i loved the tweed design but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny so i had to send it back
10086,2.0,i was so excited for this dress to arrive but when it did it was a major disappointment there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer also the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way the colors were beautiful but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws i am lb and the small fit tts will be sending it back
10087,2.0,i ordered the dress online this dress looked pretty the material was soft and comfortable the length was perfect but the zipper was totally out of place it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn i had to return the dress i normally dont see a problem at this level in retailer clothes
10088,5.0,this great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket it has a roomy comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist got lots of compliments on the embroidery

10095,4.0,well first off i knew a jumpsuit was going to be a gamble for me i have a long torso at feet but i just loved the print and the style and typically all things sactuary so i was willing to risk it sadly the torso length was an issue and it seemed to run small to mei ordered a small which usually would fit fine but ended up pulling across my hips and with the patten being what it is well on me it just wasnt flattering or comfortable
10096,5.0,purchased this top in navy blue it is versatile appropriate for the office and to go out i specifically like the look with white jeans it looks put together the quality is good and there are several nice detsils in the design highly recomnend it

10106,2.0,really tough to read as the writing was set in the late shard to inculcate the chapters in real life as some of them have no relevance in todays worldwas a waste of timetough reading comprehension
10107,1.0,there is no much improvement in build and performance compare to previous mi a series phones disappointed with their cheap quality display in the same price you can get mind blowing displays from other manufacturers price should have been far more lesser you can see the pixels in the screen every where icons apps games in few apps even images are not displayed from ppi it came down to ppi camera is not as expected pictures are blurry you need a steady hand always it takes a lot of time to process and save clicked pic finger print takes seconds to unlock

10116,1.0,this shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it i am fairly small usually a or in tops and smaller on top barely b this top was incredibly unflattering falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy like a pillowcasesacklike fit there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me its unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders a nice transition to fall unfortunately
10117,3.0,this smells yummy and does make the hair soft but i think its just too much for my fine hair i need more of a quotmistquot type of oilserum i guess even used just on the ends it is a little heavy for finer hair but i think it would be great if you have super thick or porous ends
10118,3.0,works well except the echo dot seems to have a hard time hearing me when its playing music or talking to me i have to pick it up and speak directly into it before alexa will respond otherwise its a great tooltoy i also have an echo and it doesnt have that problem so i would recommend the echo over the echo dot

10126,1.0,only camera quality is poor
10127,3.0,i took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print it is mostly as pictured but because i have a larger chest the peplum didnt hit me in the right place it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer which was disappointing considering the price i returned it

10132,3.0,but its processor too slow any time this mobile can be hangthis one is biggest problem in this mobile
10133,4.0,disclaimer this is big detailed review bluetooth earphones are of good quality sweat and waterresistant charging time is minutes works for hours use straight and can be on standby mode for hours hence overall covers hours usage initially if you are migrating from good pain of wired earphone like jbl cssi or scheniser cx you will feel its sound somewhat different with extra base however you can control sound profile using installing equilizer app from play store however one thing is important this is not that much suitable for runners when i start running with them its neckband and battery unit starts oscillating over my neck earbuds remain fix on ears due to the extensions provided with it however this neckband and battery units are not at all that much stable so if you are planning to use these for day to day use then this is great bluetooth earphone but if you are trying to pair them while running then this is not at all a suitable match in addition the design is such that after wearing them around neck cables creates a sharp bend near the battery unit which is a matter of concern and can cause bluetooth earphones to go bad in short time i almost forgot about keys provided on the neckband these are great tactile and highly responsive google assistant also works flawlessly with the help of them range wise if you are in the same room around feets distant from mobile then these earphones works best after that if you increase distance further or change room and go to the next room some glitches in sound occurs i almost forgot about one thing the storage for these earphones it is very difficult to store them in any container or box as compared to any other wired earphone which you can wrap and place in any box or pouch hence as you cannot wound it you have to always wear them on the neck no other option you cannot just slip them in the last pocket of your backpack as this can cause harms to cables this is almost annoying for me every time
10134,3.0,it is indeed cut to the shape of a trench however i think retailer should rename it as its more like wearing a cardigan its soft and pretty which i like however i wasnt convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material

10136,3.0,not happy with the sound quality no bass ive expected little but its not worth it boat or iball wouldve been a better option my first time purchasing jbl and this is not what i expected after the hype in town guess ppl dont know what bass sound is
10137,2.0,i have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isnt too short i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee so i ordered this in the regular this dress was not what i expected it is not flowy but rather a heavy and stiff fabric it is also way too wide it looks like it cant decide whether to be a box or a bag it is also shorter than advertised last thing to disappoint was the color darker and more muted than the photo on the website i cant
10138,4.0,it is a great phone in such a low priceand battery stays for a day or even a little more depending on your usagesound quality is the best

10140,3.0,i am somewhere between a and a i have narrow hips but an average waist so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral they did stretch out a little with wear but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day i typically really like cottonlinen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if im going for a casual look a few wrinkles with linen doesnt bother me but these oh my when i pulled them out o

10145,1.0,stop working one side in less than month
10146,2.0,i read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent with all of the extra material in the back it billowed out in all the wrong places the material is comfy and its a very cute concept just didnt work for me
10147,1.0,one of the very worst product and customer service the battery got drained out even though if the mi y phone is in locked state i tried to return it back but the amazon customer care in india not allowing to do it rather it taking to unwanted page to trouble shoot the phone i tried all but still the battery goes low very fast
10148,1.0,not up to the mark its looks very ugly
10149,1.0,worst one worst battery
10150,1.0,i ordered iphone and suddenly headphones stop working also the return and support window closed
10151,5.0,money value
10152,5.0,first of all i want to buy asus rog series laptop which is on sale with price tag k with gb ramcore i th gen h processor gb nvidia ti graphics and so and so but i changed my mind when i saw this laptop sale in amazon with price tag because of its features first thing it had slightly less power full processor than core i th gen ie and ryzen h but powerful graphics than gtx ti second thing it is a gaming notebook metioned by asus and it is slim so you have to take care about heat vents third thing you cant get hz display like in rog laptop i mentioned above but you get a ips display with great visual quality finally you can do almost all things you want ie watchin movievideo editinggaming etc conclusion best laptop at this price tag
10153,1.0,after days the charging port isnt working and now i cant even return it wat to do i know there is one year warranty but it is only been days cmon boat please send me new one
10154,4.0,ordered the shirt online beautiful print and good quality material runs very large size down may be sizes as the material on the body is very wide i will be exchanging it in the store
10155,2.0,i am not satisfied with this product the build quality is very nice and the screen is also good the keyboard is okay so you will not be able to type for long the keyboard backlight works well now the big problem with this laptop is with its configuration if you are using this laptop for work buy the higher variants only with this config laptop is super slow review after month of use its a bad choice for professionals dont buy
10156,1.0,with just a little crash of one feet whole display is broken
10157,3.0,no users manual is provided
10158,3.0,tray bent the defrost button is hidden behind the fridge the user manual not much of help hope she works now
10159,2.0,very bad experience all damage product
10160,4.0,this is good
10161,3.0,i would like to highlight few issues which i observed compared to other mobiles although its better for the price he is giving if i click on any link it takes through mi browser instead of chrome and i did not see option to select chrome as default browser its a big pain very very difficult to uninstall mi apps by general public he should have knowledge on how software works in order to uninstall max volume brightness is less when compared to other mobiles display clarity is little low even when compared with lenevo k power new work reception net speed is less lot of times finger unlock is not working bluetooth signal breaks if mobile placed in back picked it has become a pain while jogging and cycling display size is not what we imagine before buying few notifications on top centre hidden as speaker and sensor r placed in display
10162,2.0,too wide the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape you cant see your figure underneath at all i dont like pieces like that this went back
10163,3.0,back camera clarity is not good
10164,2.0,i really wanted to like this its soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue but thats where the positives end i ordered the xs and it was huge wide shapeless and way too long im lbs and even if it came in petite im not sure its worth the price because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out
10165,4.0,bahut hi achha h i like ti
10166,3.0,its not samsung ms its look like samsung m they told camera mp but its performing like mp front camera also very less quality mpmp bettery also not like mah looks like mah if you use continually it will come to hours mahmah to get full charge its taking nearly to hours while charging its showing fast charging but its not offers and cost is okay if you use continually to hours its getting heat now all mobiles are same notei absorbed days based on that i have given this review i got it sep early morning
10167,3.0,pros are battery backup on full charge easily day backup with internet and calls and camera usage as well camera is good wide lense is good no lag in any games cons biggest con is display yes many says its not to worry much but its actually a big thing to worry you wont be able to understand what actual colors are in photo you shoot until you send it to someone else mobile or open on laptop red looks pink blue look sky blue saturation of display is too high and there is no setting to adjust it at all you have to get used to it thats the only way personally i liked everything of this phone but i will trade this phone with less specs for better display because you wont be able to understand anything what actually its looking like even when purchasing anything else you wont under what coloured tshirt you are buying
10168,4.0,have now
10169,3.0,with ma i was expecting atleast a day long battery life but it does not gives more than to hrs of normal usage camera quality is bit ordinaryoperating speed is also below my expectation
10170,1.0,such a crap product only one side of the earphone is working now and it is only a month since i bought this product now i am unable to contact for replacement alsobecause the number given here is invalid for warranty
10171,4.0,i love this shampoo it leaves my hair so soft and shiny i did recently do a hot oil treatment at home and usually i can wash all the oil out with two washes three tops but after washing my hair with this shampoo like times i just reached for some suave i think its great for my dry hair that it strips the hair less than other brands ive used but im not sure it would be so great for oily hair i love the light scent of this shampoo i just wish it came in a bigger bottle it doesnt last that long but overall im very happy with it and will continue to repurchase its not the best but one of the best ive used and the price is pretty good and i like that its available in my small town
10172,4.0,good smart feature and picture quality is ok
10173,5.0,better than others power bank
10174,4.0,sometimes my hair can get pretty dry unless i am using the right conditioner that works for me when i throw in organic it forsure helps to moisturize my hair taking vitamins is so important for this aspect too i take a hair skin and nails supplement that helps a lot i will always have this product as part of my hair regimen it isnt a life safer but gives my hair that extra pizzaz
10175,4.0,great sense of humour nice inspirational
10176,1.0,poor quality screen
10177,1.0,i so wanted this skirt to work love the design but its way way too long i am lb and the small is inch on the floor i step on the skirt as i walk
10178,3.0,im and lbsc and hippyi ordered the p and p bc im curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okaycouldnt justify the price its a beautiful dress in the green color the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break but if it fit i wouldve overlooked it the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it i wouldve had to have it sewn shut
10179,2.0,i really like this dressshirt its great for layering super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this years pregnancy weight gain i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size this may sound weird but ive tried on an and a and the ability to reach forward didnt change between the two sizes i just returned the and am hopeful the i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back
10180,4.0,may not be suitable for serious gamers but excellent value for money in the budget phone range

10182,5.0,this battery good and sound quality and camera is not good than mi note pro
10183,5.0,i love this style reminds me of what we used to wear back in the s its very cute flattering and material is a high quality will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans if you like this baby doll style youll love this
10184,2.0,it creates echo at other hand while talking person who is at other hand feels echo so it is not comfortable conversation for long time
10185,1.0,i was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse the purple version but the design is terrible for me its boxy i didnt like the fabric and the arm ruffles are bizarre its going back tomorrow
10186,2.0,all over is good but camera quality not good
10187,4.0,pros very good cameraif you want to more sharp or good picture use google camera good battery life build quality is very good seems like premium phone usb type c port if you use v amp charger you can fully charge approximately minutes earpice volume and hands free speaker volume is very good and clear stock android cons hd display hybrid sim slot finger print scanner is very slow if you use temperd glass finger print sensor is not working well unlock in time attempt my conclusion overall phone is very good if you can buy this phone
10188,1.0,i bought this product along with the conditioner for the smell i had never used this brand of hair product before and i will never use it again i have long hair and i straighten it often so my hair gets dry especially in the winter and this shampoo made my hair ten times worse in only one use i could tell my hair was worse i stopped using it after a week dont buy this unless you dont care about having strawlike hair

10195,3.0,noise is not hearing proper
10196,1.0,network very slowly its very down to the network if you not buy by the fon and tech speed is slow
10197,3.0,i think i regret buying this phone the only good part of this product is its amoled screen which gives good colour contrast and deep black the camera is satisfactory its quality of image is below galaxy ons single rear camera front is good processor isnt great as i cant play heavy games i noticed one thing that while updating apps the play store automatically closes off and update gets suspended i tried to resolve it by rebooting phone but to no relief should have gone for redmi phones
10198,1.0,this phone battery was swollen
10199,1.0,the worst mp camera ever and the build quality also is poor not expected this from samsung
10200,4.0,good no headset was available

10204,3.0,nokia is very nice device with stock android having a decent camera super build quality and smooth user interfacenice for daily uses but you are a very heavy gamer for your main purpose of buying a phone is for photography then this might not be a very good option but if you are a fan of stock android and a good looking phone then this is for you
10205,2.0,this top couldve been one of my favorites ever i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear wo an extra tank unfortunately after wears several small holes appeared around the neckunder the ruffle i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry when i came to read the reviews i noticed i wasnt the only customer with this issue

10210,1.0,apple is good but the features for apple from amazon is pathetic i got network issue both sim and wifi and as per policy of amazon i need walk to apple store to get it fix although since delay in software upgrade it might time take some time fix apple employee wont refer for replacement and amazon wont replace until he gives the confirmation i feel amazon should take care of this points just to add why i should hold a phone which is problematic if i want to walk till apple store i would have bought there it self right what is the point of buying from amazon thanks kiran g

10212,1.0,it cut itself off the internet and nothing ive tried reconnects it it tells us that it cannot connect several times a day so annoying
10213,1.0,i dont feel that the organix line is an all natural line at all as it does contain chemicals to it also this shampoo does not agree with my hair at all there is nothing nourishing about it at all instead it left my hair very dry and rough feeling after i used it i do not plan to ever use it again
10214,4.0,i was so excited to see this shirt in petite sizing for reference i am lbs a chest with a thin but athletic build i love the feel of this shirt it is made from a tencil blend that gives it a nice weight and drape because i dont have much of a chest i do think it is a bit lowcut on me i will probably wear a cami underneath next time it is a pretty versatile dress up or down kind of piece which is why i chose it i gave it a four star rating only because it is ama s

10220,4.0,best k smart tv

10222,1.0,waste waste waste waste waste waste
10223,5.0,this sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small and short it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on like i said great slip but id recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model
10224,2.0,i have had for a while now the wife asked me if i had set the alarm system before bed and alexa replied what time should i set the alarm this alexa seams to be chiming in a lot recently without being called on one will be getting unplugged and the other one will go to the garage as a music source if the dog in the garage orders dog bones it will get unplugged too
10225,5.0,i love these pants they are a beautiful color and very well made i like the fit and the style very much
10226,2.0,when i saw this online i immediately put it on my must buy list i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon luckily my bm store had it and i am so glad i didnt waste my money or time ordering it online this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark what the product shot online doesnt show is that it has dol
10227,2.0,i thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected i felt dowdy in it
10228,2.0,have not talk only listen
10229,1.0,really disappointing quality these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month i love pilcros and am totally shocked at the poor qualityretailer i hope this is just a fluke not worth the money
10230,3.0,trust n buy
10231,4.0,i love this dress my bra straps do not show in the back you can slightly see them in the front but wearing black or nude gets you around this problem i love the slim designit is very flattering i tried this is my normal size but also the petite the petite did not work for me since there is a larger fabric cutout for the butt areathis was too high and above my natural waste because of this i opted for the slightly longer option where the extra fabric was surrounding my bum this does
10232,2.0,the design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to also the seam below the chest was uncomfortable needed to return

10238,3.0,pros battery life front and back camera cons display fingerprint sensor ease of use
10239,5.0,bought it as a gift she loves it
10240,4.0,this is a really cute style of tsihrt i totally disagree with the reviewers who thought this was too short in the torso andor overwhelming im and about pounds and this fits just fine i ordered a size small beautiful drape and i thought relatively slim cut the only reason im not giving this stars across the board is that the fabric is a little too thin not sheer or seethrough but not as substantial as i would expect for the price
10241,5.0,ordered this coat in a small it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect im and weigh around the sleeves are slightly longer than the fabric is so soft the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child she referred to it as her car coat i believe that was a style then worth the

10248,1.0,i am literally done with ogx ive tried several of their products results are always gross this will be the last of anything from ogx i waste my money on was hoping this could help manage my extremely bleach damaged hair but all this does is make my hair stringy or crunchy when sprayed on dry hair or extremely extremely dry when applied on wet or dry hair it couldnt be how much im applying i literally do a light mist waste of quid save your money the ultimate blends honey serum forget the exact name is literlly half the price and actually works spilling all the tea on this product
10249,1.0,warast
10250,2.0,not a great phone camera quality is average functionality of phone is not satisfactory battery life is not good
10251,2.0,the cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering it is great quality but designed poorly returned it
10252,3.0,battery backup is unbelievable network is not very strong even without any case even in network there are so many issues with mobile data it doesnt works well
10253,5.0,best book one can every read
10254,3.0,good mobile but service by amazon transportation was worst
10255,1.0,system ui is not properly working noticed issue in days after usage of phone graphical display went to black screen and after restart it can back but dissatisfied it with new mobile
10256,3.0,has a strong fresh green scent this is a lightweight siliconebased treatment it is a nice detangler and left my hair soft and smooth without weighting it down i did not notice any increase in volume from this conditioner
10257,1.0,new tv purchased and then the engineer tries to connect wifi and it fails smart tv does not detect wi fi he tries to reset the tv to factory settings times still the same and then he leaves then the pain starts to call customer service and ask for a replacement they say they will send another engineer from another team then another engineer comes and confirms that it is defective and needs to be replaced then again speak to amazon and they say they have a new product but not for replacement lolzwhat a joke finally this shows the transparency and decided to send it back and not buy this brand ever again
10258,1.0,i am petite even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace it made it look cheap i wanted this to be the perfect lbd i just couldnt make it work on my body
10259,3.0,update i replaced this product with a new one and realized a couple of things first is the wifi will be dropping and reconnecting if its a slow network for example when the tab is connected to an idle mobile phones hotspot where data speed is slow in the phone itself when its idle else if the connection is fast eg router acts a hotspot there should be no wifi drops secondly the dhp protocols and proxy settings wont crash if youve not done a network reset on your tab thirdly the headphone jack issue isnt a problem in the new device i couldnt find a possible explanation for the problem so i guess it was a oneoff problem with my previous tab received the product within days of ordering everything was working except the main thing for which it was needed wifi once the wifi was manually switched on it turned itself off automatically and then on automatically i tried everything under the sun to fix this issue network reset factory reset safe mode turning off hotspot turning off scanning nearby devices nothing worked additionally you cant modify the dhp protocols and proxy settings of a particular hotspot as the app crashes the final nail in the coffin was when i found out that once you inset the earphoneheadphone into the jack the wifi again starts turning itself on and off every now and then and you cant even watch a video peacefully after that i ordered for a replacement and strangely enough i havent been issued one even on pen and paper amazon is yet to register an order from their side moreover you wont be refundedgiven another tab from a different company your moneygiven another tab from the same company you will only get a replacement and that too if you find any issues within the first days bottom line save some money and go for ipad air best tab hands down considering every aspect
10260,3.0,i bought when the price was k so it doesnt worth the price better wait for the discount around k will be good
10261,1.0,seems like i received a defective product from amazon within a week of purchase the speaker didnt worked tried rebooting the system got worked and faced the same problem within a week meanwhile i lost my chance to replace the item even other qualities of the phone were too bad i suggest dont go for this phone
10262,4.0,nice product rear camera is average in low light front camera is taking slight time to stabilize the image and in normal light condition it is good the flash light is not so powerful when i compare with my honor smart it is dull only it would be better if this is bounded with metal body coz the mobile is not giving the feel
10263,2.0,the sound quality was excellent i purchased it on may it was playing music and my party and suddenly ran out of charge i am unable to get it started now charging doesnt help its not even months and i am deeply disaappointed can amazon replace it for me urgently
10264,3.0,camera is hopelessits not mppictures are not sharp and clear there is some network issue alsonotifications especially of whatspp are not delivered promptlytried all possible settings but the messagesnotifications are delivered only on opening the whatsappsome basic features like contact shortcutscreenshot with ease are missing could have done if i had not bought this mobile
10265,3.0,note if you have a large chest the seams hit in an unflattering spot nice shirt just not great for the price
10266,2.0,got this in the sky color returned it because the top is way too sheer for me if you know what i mean i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids no can do also for the price material just felt flimsy cheap it does run small the medium was good on me and im b
10267,4.0,i ordered a medium in these and they were just too small for me im a so i was pushing it there is no room for thighs but the material is great and the styling is fun the length seemed ok for me too im hoping when i return them they have a large for me to exchange for
10268,5.0,the fabric on this tee is a very very soft thin cotton knit its perfect for those hot muggy summers esp in the southern area of the us the sizing runs larger i am normally an xl and because of the other reviews saying it ran big i got this in a l and it fits me fine and theres room to spare so if you are a size or this will fit in a l nicely its thin but i dont think its immodest or too sheer a white or beige bra would not show through this easily at all the leng
10269,1.0,this phone has the worst signal receptionthe camera is not as good as they boastbuttery comes down to less than percent by pm even though i charge it fully every morning im very disappointed with the phonemy advice is not to buy this
10270,1.0,worst product made by samsung its ridiculous heinous because samsung got money from customers but denied to return money so a brutal and failure customer care working for them
10271,3.0,purchased this should in the blue motif in size small i am usually between a small and medium in shirts c broad shoulders the fit was fine in the small however i had a few issues with the top the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn the front midbottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look and the back has alot of fabric see back of tank in white motif and was very voluminous for me it wasn
10272,1.0,the unit shows bytes in a pc or the phone it keeps dismounting also i got a replacement and it did the same thing not sure what is going on but it looks like a chinese counterfeit case i have seen this happen more and more lately amazon seems to be a major portal for these hings it makes sense with a such a large retailer they cant check everything
10273,4.0,perhaps i purchased the wrong size i will return to a store and try on the small the medium just looks a little sloppy on me i absolutely love the length and the color will likely exchange for a smaller size and wear it all spring and summer
10274,3.0,bluetooth is not working properly or i would say its not compatible with several bluetooth earphone and speakers i think theres a problem with bluetooth
10275,4.0,battery drains fastly and facing heating issue it was not expected with oneplus
10276,1.0,pathetic
10277,4.0,good quality sound and built but expensive sound experience is awesome for meter distance beyond it just like listening music from mobile speaker
10279,1.0,this dress had so much potential the top was absolutely gorgeous my issue was with the bottom half of the dress the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead
10280,4.0,i had a dilemma of buying realme pro or samsung galaxy ms but finally i chose samsung and i am glad the biggest spec i like is mah battery if you are a mild user not using games then it will work almost days a heavy user can use it for days in a single full charge for a test i charged it and used it till it switches off automatically it worked beautifully even in battery more than minutes lets see what happens when it gets old any phone works good when its new camera is fine fingerprint is a second slower than mi and realme phones samoled display is the main thing which distinguishes it better than other phones it shows more beautiful clear colors specially black than lcd screens it feels awesome to touch the samoled screen while navigation the hardware of phone is cheap plastic material but feels good when you carry it as its lighter phone despite having massive battery capacity after days of using this phone i have no objection over its performance i played call of duty mobile efficiently the exynos processor works smoothly camera clicks really good mp pictures but still it needs better pixel density it does not make a crow a swan like oppo phones do but if you like pics as originals without or with some slight effects and filters my friend grab the monster the charger is ok w is slower for mah battery it charges the phone full in about hrs it would have been better if w or more provided then too at this price range what more can you expect above all you get only a phone sim ejector pin a charger adapter with usb type c cable with some paperworks inside the product box dear samsung thats so rude no back cover or screenguard provided its called kanjoosi depends on what you need in a phone i needed massive battery capacity in a phone as i reside in such place where electricity supply is not good so its a good phone for me the reason i am giving it star is because of its nonpremium hardware meagre w charger and non availability of accesories remember one thing phones do get old now in just one month so i will not recommened you to buy it months later

10282,2.0,this is the first hd in paris top i havent loved high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color this was an online only item so i guessed at the size typically order a petite ordered the regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length it was oddly constructed small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it on too bad but it went back
10283,5.0,this top is gorgeous and better than the web photo i love that it goes with the offtheshoulder trend while allowing for a normal bra in fact it even has the little snaps at the shoulders to hold your straps in place awesome detail the ruffled portion looks good over or under your arms length hit at about my hip with long torso lbs b and and it has an overall flowy but not sacklike fit i found this to fit tts bought my usual s beautiful vivid print looks great with wh
10284,2.0,many commands dont work properly once synced with my dish network hopper the echo dot starts to play whatever is on the tv essentially creating an echo that drives me crazy it will not stop no matter what we do the only command that seems to work is to say alexa mute and for about a minute it will stop playing then it starts again i currently have my alexa unplugged actually its been unplugged for several weeks therefore am no longer using it due to this incredibly annoying glitch the worst part is that i work for dish network and i have been pushing these units like crazy now i feel extremely insecure pushing this product im great with electronics what happens to a customer who isnt techsavvy amazon please fix this

10290,1.0,the product was dead in just one and half years apple service is great experience but they charged rs for checking the machine and asked another fiftyfive thousand rupees for replacing the battery and board which was found to have issues now the macbook is with my kids
10291,3.0,poor quality it is not indian version seller has his own mrp label on this
10292,1.0,worst ever handset i bought in my life within months its pixels got bursted and half of the screen became like a dark spot finger print not always works to unlock the cell common issue in all m series handset they spread false warranty propaganda and had multiple policies in place to reject our claim when we knock the services center for any companymanufacturing defect complete waste of money never ever recomend to get trap by there false propaganda and advertisement for them and there customer service executive a semi damage hardware is equal to pin point damage and it will be not qualify for warranty even after a week of procurementthey hide there technical glitch behind there policies and fooling indian customers
10293,4.0,i write review on mi a picture quality good sound quality good battery life one day use only if not play heavy game
10294,4.0,i was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique my only gripe is the length it hits the very top of my pants so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath this fit true to size
10295,3.0,a very average product at this price rangefinger print scanner hardly worksthe front camera works as the ambient light sensor so sensitivity is less and is very slow to reactbattery life is goodscreen sensitivity could have been better
10296,2.0,this looks great on the model but when it arrived i couldnt believe it was the same jacket it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it i really wanted to like it but even the xss was too baggy also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isnt actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry
10297,2.0,i read few negative feedback but still trusted jbls brand but the time i plugged them in my computer i was heartbroken worst ever bass i am not asking for a metal music bass but a basic bass is also needed for music the sound quality is similar to the headphones to get in flight
10298,3.0,good speaker for its price packed with features go for it if you want a good speaker on a tight budget but if you have the budget look for better sounding ones

10300,3.0,bang for the buck choice
10301,5.0,this dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about inches above my knee and i am i will wear this with tights for work color is very nice also
10302,4.0,at last a worthy replacement for my muchlamented john frieda cool dip shampoo i ran across this in the drugstore the other day quite by accident and bought it strictly for its fragrance and pretty turquoise bottle turns out to be a really nice shampoo pearly aqua color nice silky texture lathers well and leaves my midback length slightly wavy colored hair clean soft and smelling great i havent tried any of the other products in this range but just ordered a bunch online to be reviewed in the future i did not care for any of the ogx shampoos ive tried so this was a pleasant surprise
10303,1.0,screen broke after days i should have gone for a different phone now the screen is chipping off and all that happened without even dropping the phone its a total waste of money
10304,4.0,goes for a long time working great
10305,3.0,little bit heating issue and price should be a little bit low overall performance can be said good
10306,1.0,not for the ones who are seeking sth beyond those basic tenets of motivation superficial and elementary standard might be of help to those having lower threshold to overcome monsters
10307,3.0,not the best sound when playing music

10311,4.0,cute summervacation dress lightweight material but not flimsy im normally a xss and i ordered the s petite which was right bc i think the xs would have been too clingy looking the regular length would also have been too long
10312,4.0,this is to be given as a christmas gift so not able to give a fair rating at this time
10313,2.0,friends i bought this tv after watching techibeez channel on youtube i believe they are paid for good review this tv is of below par quality back light bleeds and i have seen the same on all the review panels as well as mine upscaling is also very poor a lot of motion blur only positive side is brightness these inch k tvs are available in lajpatrai market for k with year warranty i think it is waste of money buying this from amazon i suggest buy a better brand dont go for this piece of crap
10314,1.0,mobile bin not receive
10315,3.0,ive rarely met a maeve item i didnt like initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but its a structured cotton making it a little more stiff than id like i feel that making it suede wouldve been perfect for this dress i am lbs usually a i tried on the and it was a great fit except for the chest area d and the butthips area making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region i then tried on the and it was way too big all a
10316,2.0,i cant believe how small this thing runs beyond small its almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work but theres no way its going to when the l is actually a s so sad to return this beauty
10317,5.0,i ordered the mauve in size xl and it fits true to size it matched the photos online all of the details are prettier in person its delicate but its washeddried well very pretty shade of mauve
10319,2.0,i loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little ummmmm no its weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay im only a b weigh pounds and it made me look huge and awkward this is going back
10320,3.0,i love this skirt in theory the style is fun and original and the quality was excellent however being suede the skirt was very bulky also at and liking skirts to be long enough for work i typically dont have problems with long length however i thought this skirt fit too long on me such that it distracted from the style i really wanted to love this skirt hopefully theyll make some updates in future styles
10321,5.0,the product was delivered on time with good packaging the camera is super light weight but i took the mm kit so the lens made it kinda heavy ive already researched on this camera and i knew i made the correct choice and i just upgraded from a d to this only con i found in this camera is the snap bridge feature which needs a little improvement otherwise i would highly recommend to enthusiasts like me
10322,5.0,excellent bose is boss
10323,3.0,cute dress flattering and seems to be well made however when i received it it seemed that it had been worn the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape the other dress i place with my order hasnt even shipped and the rep couldnt tell me whenif it would
10324,4.0,wished this had worked for me however i prefer smaller armholes so my bra and skin not so young anymore dont show the beige lining shows at the armholes as well on the upside its very slimming even with the stiff petticoat so cute perfect length for me another caveat if your back is not completely symmetrical as mine isnt the decorative back straps sit in a wonky position im lbs and the oop was perfect but for the above objections
10325,1.0,use less product after using few days the phone started hanging and it takes secs to open each app dont buy this even if they give it for rs
10326,2.0,well
10327,3.0,not user friendly cant keep it online with the wifi
10328,3.0,my first complaint is this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around not all the way you can see the pin in the back that should have been a clue that this dress isnt meant to fit anyone properly if it doesnt fit the model i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top or the fabr
10329,3.0,its ok is about all i can say
10330,4.0,the first one i received died in less than months it just stopped reading lost all that was on the card but sandisk customer service was excellent and replaced it not so enthused about the speed transfers between phone and pc usb werent impressive in my opinion slow but the bottleneck could be the phone but still
10331,4.0,i have been using this since months no complains till now
10332,5.0,very nice and very accurate fitband strap is very durable much better than mi band
10333,3.0,great idea but this was not a flattering top on me it almost worked but ended up making me look like i am pregnantnot a look i am striving to achieveit has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso for the price it did not justify a place in my closet
10334,2.0,i brought the product looking at the promo videos which shows app like jio cinema viu and there was a press release which said prime video will also be there but hang on none of these are there on tv there are some insignificant content from viu which noone would like to watch its like showing something and delivering something else
10335,1.0,i was very impressed the sound quality loudness of the portable speaker i bought in october but within months the sounds started bursting lot of noise from the speaker very disappointed
10337,2.0,the quality of the fabric is good but the fit is horrible unflattering and strange definitely a pass
10338,1.0,i saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it they had an extra large i usually wear a large and i thought it would perfect with some leggings i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldnt fit it past her chest either we flipped it inside out and couldnt find a zipper maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small its too bad it looked adorable and i was so excited to try
10339,5.0,nice battery and camera
10340,1.0,product quality is too low and not as per the expectations and price i was not expecting this kind of worst camera quality from samsung megapixel of any other phone is far better than megapixel samsung camera also there is no exchange available on amazon for this product so think twice before you by from amazon
10341,3.0,good bat
10342,3.0,the sound is pathetic picture quality is below standard and the battery life is acceptable over all not at all happy with the device
10343,3.0,when these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on
10344,3.0,smells nice like coconut sun screen the smell seems to linger though so if you dont like it dont get it im using this on my short almost pixie style hair to give it a texurized messy look and with such short hair its easy to use way too much usually i try to just dab a finger in the wax and then melt it in my palms and that is usually a good amount scrunching and brushing my hair back with my fingers gives the voluminous stickyup look im going for while holding my bangs in place i wont need to buy another one of these for ages because its so huge but i think if i dont find one that surpasses this and is perhaps creamier i would repurchase
10345,3.0,this is one of the good handset launched by samsung battery is good everything is ok samsjng should improve the camera by giving regular update as of now mega pixel camera giving result of vga camera samsing team please focus on camera otherwise it will spoil your brand and reputaion in future if your careless attitude continues like this product team please enable notification feature through update
10346,2.0,after one month of usage the speaker is not working so for me this was waste of money it was better if i would have purchased it from direct shop
10347,1.0,please save your money and invest elsewhere this phone is not worth for even k the so called camera phone has terrible camera and the pics quality is as same that you would get on any cheap smart phone the photo looks to artificial and the phone hangs and works weirdly on its own just terrible experience
10348,1.0,very bad phone because of hanging issue amazon give not replace facilty i talk to amazon technicians bt no resolution
10349,1.0,no bluetooth security i ordered one of these and also a regular amazon echo the i found from online reviews that there is absolutely no authentication or security required whatsoever for bluetooth there are lots of stories online where anyone think neighbors condos apartments can connect to your echo device without authentication or your approvalknowledge amazon should know better and should provide bluetooth security features configuring customized pin to restrict connection etc i really wanted to give echo a try but canceled my order after learning of amazons total disregard for bluetooth security very disappointing amazon you can do better
10350,4.0,i really wish this had fit me so i could keep the vest beautiful colors and construction i am with a c chest the medium was quite a bit too small across the chest i could not close the hook but it fit perfectly around the hips i did not want to order a large because i felt the boxy style would be too large around the hips even if the chest fit better
10351,2.0,i had really high hopes for this shampoo but ive been using it for a month now and its just terrible for my scalp it gave me bothersome itchy and flaky scalp and trust me i shampoo my hair very well leaving no trace of it so it would make more sense if i didnt have itchiness but unfortunately i did it smells really nice and does moisturize my hair and leaves it soft in the same day but the next day i start to get an itchy scalp the conditioner i would rate as a it is so nice and i will continue to use that one its very thick and i use it as a deep conditioner too
10352,2.0,wrost batery backup and slow working interneta and data isuess
10353,1.0,dont dont dont buy this phone phone speaker is not working
10354,3.0,this top runs small across the top i was amazed at the materialpolyester i am surebecause the price was so high it has a sheer layer underneath which i think would make it hot in the summer i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online
10355,5.0,the boat usually have a great sound quality especially in bluetooth segment i have models of boat bluetooth earphones all are best on sound quality
10356,2.0,tried this on at my local retailer the red color is pretty but not a true red the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days two big problems though the top is very low cut and i could see it opening up to the world and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra this is a dealbreaker for me it cant be fixed
10357,2.0,nope it makes my hair too thick the product itself is thick and comes out as a log which i drop on the floor in the shower i dont like the conditioner either
10358,2.0,while i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger when i tried it on it just felt like a mess perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies i hated that the zipper was in the front i personally find it tacky and gawdy while the patterns are pretty the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didnt see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me
10359,3.0,im surprised to be unhappy with this reading all the rave reviews but i had a different experience with it the cut is funky and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture i think if youre very slim this may work well but for any curves or hips not so flattering imo i think its a pretty jacket but not for me its going back and ps i paid for it and see its on sale for about that just a week later the discounted price may be a good de
10360,4.0,on the fence about this one as i always seem to get weigh down on my hair whenever i use these shampoos the scent of this is wonderful kind of orangey and it supposed to quothealquot split ends and frayed damaged hair i dont know about these claims but it does seem to defrizz my hair and smoothes it to some extent as with the shea butter shampoo my hair feels slightly coated and a bit oily maybe its the olive oil factor dont know overall though this seems to clean my hair pretty well though i would like it to be shinier not a great shampoo in my opinion but not bad either havent decided whether i would buy this again love the bottle though
10361,2.0,thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat i got a size small felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth very unflattering another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottomadding to the overall bad look i had it on for about seconds and put it back in the bag to return dint have to ponder about it at all
10362,2.0,d camera not working cannot setup faceid always displaying face id not available error neither front camera portrait working please help dont have a clue where to go for help
10363,2.0,very vad experience tv had delivered but installation not available its horrible dont buy this
10364,4.0,so this skirt is everything the only downside is that its not in a petite sizing so im going to have to get this altered im the sizing is appropriate usually wear an or in pants and got a size medium for the skirt the material is thick enough for spring or summer weather the color is just right not too light the pockets are adorable and i feel like im channeling some s realness sits higher on your waist and is super comfortable i know im going to get a lot of use o
10365,5.0,wonderfull product
10366,4.0,battery sustains for about day unfortunately no inlet for earphone jack lots of issues regarding call drops which are related to one plus and not the network provider otherwise the phone is absolutely fluid and easy to use this is the first time im using a one plus and due to the call drop issues im slightly turned off hopefully oneplus resolves these issues in their next update
10367,1.0,mobile phone is very bad after months starting repairing work whenever i was upgraded my phone this problem occurs i am attaching image over here this is the receipt from your service center one center saying that this is liquid issue and other said this is display issue and not because of liquid and no one help you service center realme customer care no one
10368,3.0,for k the phone is a great deal with inches screen mpmp rear camera and a mp front camera along with a mah battery its a total package but what is the use of such great specs with not so great performance the camera works fine under daylight situations only with the ai mode enabled and during the night it shoots pictures like an mp camera next the speaker is something which i didnt expect it literally plays kbps song as if it is playing a lowquality audio file the battery output of this is good and the display is vivid and bright for streaming it is a huge package with limited functionalities if you are looking for a budget phone with mediocre necessities then this is it
10369,2.0,gorgeous color and great price but too low cut and because of the design a camis wouldnt work disappointed
10370,3.0,quite good
10371,5.0,this is a really well made great looking blouse the details are charming i like that it is a good weight not too sheer the sleeves are perfect i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try its a keeper
10372,2.0,key pad not working as properly in keypad u b keys are not working request for replace new mobile

10374,1.0,very slow charging only after months
10375,3.0,good tv in this price range
10376,4.0,very good phone at k
10377,1.0,the power bank worked well for months after which it refused to charge not even one point in hours this is a common problem faced by many customers
10378,1.0,i loved the design and look to this shirt but it ran way big for me i loved the forgiving fit but it just wasnt flattering at all i even went down one size and it still was huge sad to send this one back
10379,1.0,worst quality
10380,3.0,reviewing after months overall sound quality good with decent bass but facing charging problem these days cant play more than half hour via bluetooth frustrating
10381,1.0,i agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such this really does have a lot going on i usually wear a in skirts and based on reviews went up one size it still saw way up near my chest i think even an would be too small its sooooo tiny at the waist probably buy sizes and sizes up from your own also the skirt flares super wide at the sides it doesnt sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand its like a skirt
10382,1.0,battery back up is not good mobile phone immediately heat up very inconvenient to use voice is not clear and touch screen is not working properly
10383,5.0,a really helpful device with a giant source of sustenance when your phone runs out off battery moreover it can fuel devices at a time the only flaw is the heaviness but that can be ignored in view of the powerful backup it provides when you need it the most
10384,3.0,i was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium bad choice now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me i will be getting this one tailored
10385,1.0,i got defective piece amazon is not agreeing for return the mobilethis mobile is not working as my previous gb ram mobileperformance is very very low i am waiting for replacement they are not agreeing for return mobile
10386,3.0,like the first reviewer i love the color and look and agree that it is much longer and wider than it looks in the photo i am lb and ordered a small i was planning to wear it tucked into palazzo pants as the model seems to have done but they must have used some other way to gather up the sweater in back because there is no way such volumes of material can be tucked into anything and the metallic threads are itchy so i had to finally layer a full sleeve tee under it to be able to st
10387,2.0,its picking up the audio on my other devices and deleting audio from them
10388,2.0,we enjoyed using echo dot unfortunately it only lasted nine months and quit working when i called amazon they told me the warranty was only days and offered me a discount on a new one like i would want to spend more money on something that lasted less than a year amazon doesnt stand behind its product and their customer service basically tells you to pound sand if you have an issue with their items buy apple instead they offer a year warranty
10389,1.0,i have bought samsung m by th april initially it works okay but after month its started hanging and shutting down automatically now my phone is switch off and not working since few days samsung has given only day replacement warranty and we are unable to return it back now so we are in here total loss situation by trusting with samsung brand
10390,3.0,this conditioner is a little bit more expensive than what id normally pay for say tresseme or garnier i got this on sale as i didnt quite want to pay full price for something i didnt like when i got the sample this made my hair feel like silk but since using the full bottles for almost a month now plus dying it as well it doesnt seem to really moisturize or leave it silky at all even when i leave it in for minutes its soft in the shower but then it becomes super dry i have really curly hair mind you so any bit of frizz shows up really easy this isnt worth it for me id rather go with a cheaper brand that actually does what it says
10391,4.0,bluetooth not working
10392,2.0,sound quality is very poor hanging problem and display is average
10393,1.0,damage item
10394,5.0,a great product at a very competitive price not trying to being subtle here but the sheer build quality drives home reliability convincingly android one ui is going to make your user experience oh so richer and the triple camera makes this irresistable while you end the day with battery a mah ginormous battery means the party never stops
10395,2.0,video quality is very poor apps sometime dont work
10396,1.0,one of the worst product amazon is selling i bought inch tv and within one month it stopped working it doesnt boot and keep showing kewin logo and then shuts down kevin customer care are not picking call please dont buy this as its highly unreliable and waste of money
10397,5.0,the online pictures do not do this dress justice the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think oh my gosh thats the one but if you try it on you will have this moment it is comfortable flattering and slimminga prefect everyday dress
10398,1.0,this is bad phone ever i purchased in amazon ur providing faulty piece of devices im just used the in days the display touch is completely not working why dont you giving faulty device to customer i need immediate refund replacement ur taking too much of time to do any action i completely disappointed with ur service very bad dont buy redmi its all fake product full of complaint
10399,5.0,i was looking for a holiday dress to wear to the nutcracker and what is more appropriate than a tulle skirt the tulle lays fairly flat so its flattering rather than being poufy the top is a thick material but not quite sweater material since the top is warmer it should be fine for winter even with short sleeves and a cute cardigan or furry coat im going to sparkle it up a bit with a necklace or belt but it also looks fine without extra accessories fits true to size im typically a
10400,5.0,nice print and comfortable shirt
10401,3.0,looses steam towards the end
10402,3.0,this is a very sweetsoft sweater however it runs very large and is very boxy i would say at least size down sizes i wanted to love them but i had to send it back
10403,3.0,i tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and theres not much to the design it is true to size my usual size fit well enough im on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed she also thought it made her shoulders look broad personally i liked it on
10404,1.0,for half of its price you can get oneplus which is better than this dont waste your money and buy any other phone but not an iphone in usa its really cheaper than it is in india apple is looting india just gb of ram in is the worst deal recently apple was also accused of slowing down its older phones with an excuse of updating the software i repeat trust me and dont buy an iphone
10405,1.0,not supporting fast charging on my oneplus
10406,2.0,not worth the money
10407,4.0,charges really fast heating a bit of an issue exceptional camera at this price range extra apps is an issue with mi
10408,3.0,although the product was fine its box was damaged not the amazon packaging but the product box it works fne and is satisfactory for the price paid
10409,2.0,days back phn was completely off for no reason later it worked but its ok not that worse
10410,2.0,it hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned did not fit well and was not good quality very thin
10411,1.0,just as with many other reviewers here my card worked perfectly for the first week and a half and then suddenly lost its format and could no longer be reformatted while at the same time overheating dangerously sandisk is currently issuing an rma to replace it but i am worried that the replacement could also end up being defective as is evident from the star reviews here the rate of such defects for these cards is about which to me seems like an absolutely unacceptable number for a memory card for a major manufacturer and its not like sandisk hasnt had a headsup on this problem the negative reviews have been there for quite a while clean up your act sandisk
10412,4.0,awesome product at this price excellent noise cancellation and great sound average bass but at this price point this audio product is incredible

10414,1.0,work very slow hang very fast
10415,4.0,user friendly
10416,3.0,i have to agree with another reviewer this blouse has an odd fit the small petite my usual size was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect the blouse i was sent had one sleeve
10417,4.0,in this range it is a good led but multip sereen not connecting by other phone only connected with mi phones
10418,2.0,its a laptop suitable for light gaming but has poor performance when you run software like solidworks this laptop hangs often also there are some hardware issues so you cant install other os easily like i tried to install ubuntu for using ros but cant install and these issues are not solved by asus nor they would end your warranty it lags in performance very much also amd has some issues with chrome browser
10419,1.0,the product is not good its not working properly there is an issue with receving calls
10420,1.0,poor quality control my phone is having screen bleeding issue and amazon wont replace it so buy wisely
10421,4.0,this tunic dress is an easy go to outfit it looks put together immediately it is soft and comfortable i ordered the regular xs even though typically i prefer petite sizing this dress is above my knees in the front i am and weight about i would have ordered a petite size but had previously tried this on in the store and knew the regular sizing was a good fit for me in the store i tried the taupe color which seemed a bit see through i ordered the green and it is a lovely shade
10422,1.0,okstuck with head phone symbolneeds improvement
10423,2.0,the product support is really worst during the installation the ice box was broken still its not replaced after months period also registered a complaint that vegetables get spoiled but no response after a week time now product might be good but their support is really really worst
10424,2.0,had high hopes for this product after seeing reviews from so many positive feedbacks from customers but was utterly disappointed as it failed to deliver what its supposed to do voice interaction is utter rubbish as its not able to grasp the indian slang and finding music through it is a pain content is not that great and integration with alexa app is not that smooth not able to set customized tone for alarm and lots of other drawbacks to sum it all its waste of valuable bucks as theres no easy way to throw it off
10425,4.0,nice phone just the battery backup is not good
10426,5.0,mi power bank is very good pros fast charing support upto wat no very heavy weight best product under rupees cons power bank full charge time is very long summery overall worth for money product
10427,1.0,mobile getting too much heating while using worst battery performance its really monestor battery asking charging always
10428,4.0,great price good quality but no hotstar or prime videos cannot be added too also every time you have to disconnect and reconnect the usb drive for the unit to give you the option of selection also obviously at this price you cant get sony quality but good enough can someone please advise how i could get hotstar and prime videos on this tv
10429,2.0,i dont think this product does anything it is very strongly scented with a fairly artificial coconut smell it is a runny liquid that is supposed to heat in your palms presumably to enhance the products abilities however the heat doesnt last long enough to reach the hair gimmick it probably does give a little shine ive not noticed any but maybe if used on dry hair wont repurchase
10430,1.0,nothing like about this seller worst experience ever with seller i tried many times to start power on the earphone but not working after that pluck the charger to earphone but earphone cant accept the charge red light doesnt blink its seems like the seller send me a dead earphone
10431,1.0,organix sucks i ve tried it a few timeswhen it first came out and when it was on sale nope it sucks it leaves my hair totally unmanageable it does have a minty smell but leaves no smell at all in my long thick wavy hairi do like my hair to smell nice and i do have to say that is one of the factors for me when i add a new shampoo or conditioner into my hair care rotation basically this shampoo is all hype all jellyno toast blah blah blah it didnt do anything spectacular for my hair except make it a tangled mess for me to detangle and that really pissed me off it was like i didnt use any conditioner and i have a few different shampoos from other countries that i love and have no conditioner and they still work great not organix anywayboo to this stuff maybe my hair needs the sulfates or what ever they are leaving outeither wayim done trying and buying organix it doesnt work for meim ok with sulfates and parabensnot a problem for my hair because it is tough i guess
10432,1.0,no bass and sound quality is poor
10433,5.0,superior quality of the bookprint of the book all white pagesreally great
10434,4.0,this brand used to be my goto for sulfate free shampoos and conditioners in the drugstore once i colored my hair it needed a little more tlc but if you have healthy hair this is a great suflate free option it also lathers like regular shampoo which is nice sulfate free has come a long way
10435,5.0,love this tunic very comfortable and a perfect length to the knee i wore it to a birthday party with brown booties the green moss color is perfect for the fall in new england cant wait to wear it again
10436,3.0,anybody getting this gb card be aware that this card before use needs to be formatted the problem is that computers only format gb or less i got only gb formatted of the card sandisk dont tell that to nobody so whats the use to buy such expensive card when you can only use gb instead of the you can google it and discover that other people had the same problem i wish i knewi bought it to put it on my galaxy note android phone i think they shouldnt even sell the gb or at least informed the people i heard that there are applications that could make it work but when i buy something i expect that to work without the need of hassling around since im not a geek
10437,1.0,it was supposed to be a gift but there was no note added as per my demand
10438,3.0,i am only giving this product stars becuse i purchased this one as a replacement for a sandisk micro sd card that kept having problems with i finally got tired of losing my data and ponied up the odd dollars to just replace the darn thing
10439,5.0,this top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color i wasnt too sure id like the cut on the bottom but the neckline was so lovely i thought id try it out i went with a small which is my usual if not extra small and loved it as soon as i put it on the shape is very flattering even with my post baby figure i definitely think that its better in person than in the photos online and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater thats both classic and mode
10440,5.0,im definitely not an iot person but i received a dot as a gift my first use was for a medication that i had to take five times a day for two weeks i had been utterly failing at remembering to take the medication as soon as i let alexa help me i was able to comply completely with the prescription instructions i just said alexa remind me to take my medicine at am or pm etc
10441,3.0,well made but strange fit the medium was long and narrow waaay too small
10442,1.0,i was able to get this on sale when it arrived it was missing half of the rhinestones i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way it also was missing the little bag with extra stones im reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse any help from anyone would be appreciated i hate to part with this but where was quality control
10443,4.0,good not bad
10444,4.0,sound quality is good fm is an added advantage build quality also good
10445,2.0,never buy this brand stop working exactly after months day from the date of invoice mi customer care said no warranty and only items purchased from portal the warranty from the date of delivery but for others date of invoice
10446,4.0,i purchased this laptop from ezone and not from any eretail sites like amazon and flipkart i have been using it since months now pros looks are good build quality is good sound is good battery backup is nice too full hd at bucks is good windows original good for multimedia purpose usage cons due to factory installed windows it is slow after booting disk usage is high so for programming purpose you either format and install windows or upgrade your ram to gb
10447,2.0,really like this dress but the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes impossible has to go back
10448,1.0,if you have colour treated hair do not use this product not only was the product a waste of time and money but it cost me much more because i had to get my hair recoloured after there is no warning on the packaging or the directions on the bottle despite the company insisting that there is after contacting organixvogue international the customer service is among the poorest i have experienced i told them that my coloured hair had turned an unnatural shade after following the instructions and i had to wash it out after hours they pretty much told me quotsorry you feel that way and our directions on the packaging and bottle indicate to do a strand testquot not true if you read the packaging and bottle directions they indicate no such thing in fact the opposite it says quotsafe on colour treated hairquot when i scanned the packaging and directions and emailed them again as proof they didnt even bother to respond bad product bad customer service
10449,5.0,have been using this phone for a months and here are some pros n cons pros display is very nice mah battery lasts for to hours for moderate users sound output is great no call drop or network issues camera quality is great near stock android experience android has been updated runs very smoothly no hang issues or any heating issues till date cons back is very slippery but the cover provided by mi takes care of this issue not for heavy gamers battery lasts for to hours if pubg is played continuously fast charger not provided but phone charges from to in hour minutes overall a smooth experience and this is probably the best and closest to a stock android feel id say good value for money for those who love stock android
10450,2.0,the band is thick it should have been a thiner and also the band cannot be paired to multiple accounts which is annoying also the customer care service do not help and just say nothing can be done if something goes wrong with your smart band the touch sensor on band is even not very sensitive sometimes it has to be pressed roughly to glow the band
10451,5.0,this top is beautiful on i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory of which i tried both on i purchased the black as it was more stunning i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect it has a nice pleat in the front in case you have a teeny bit of tummy i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings the body fabric is a lighter cotton i am and it hits at hip length it does not have
10452,2.0,this shirt runs very large i will be returning for a smaller size

10458,4.0,good product for the price
10459,3.0,i am happy with the product but not with amazon service i ordered black colour phone and after making the payment got confirmation of blue colour
10460,1.0,this is the worst conditioner i have ever used it is so runny and liquidy and it does nothing for my long coarse curly hair conditioners should condition hair and make your hair look better but this one made my hair look frizzier and dryer than before i would give it zero stars if i could thats how bad it is
10461,5.0,i thought the design of this dress was distinctive and it did not let me down there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on but i wouldnt sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony im and i got the petite which hit me about inches above my knee material is like jeans and consequently not seethrough at all even though it is quite expensive there is something special about the dress
10462,3.0,iphone aur other phone me kya parak hai

10468,3.0,product invoice does not contain any information of the mobile delivered to me it is requested to generate invoice with product serial number software has some bugs camera and speed are absolutely stunning there are some limitations with camera like k uhd images can be recorded for minutes slowmotion can be recorded for minute
10469,1.0,i purchased this instore in a vivid red color but didnt try it on until i got home big mistake literally the first time i tried to zip the dress the cheap horrible zipper noted in previous reviews justbroke midway up right under the waist tie i was trapped in the dress for a good minutes and was scared id have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape cant wait to return this asap
10470,4.0,i ordered both colors in different sizes xs and xxs petite were no longer available so cant compare there color i liked the black better for these reasons color can be worn yearround just add a nice jacket or cardigan and ok for winter season ivory was kind of seethrough size xxs fit me better the xs was wider and bigger arm holes sadly the xxs was the ivory so i didnt keep either of them ref lbs dd in wasit
10471,3.0,i tried this on in my usual xs lbs and it fit like a dream i was instantly in love until i looked from the side and realized it was cut up way too short i have a longer torso and shorter legs and this came up past my finger tips if i stood with my arms down no way could i wear this as a dress as a tunic definitely though but i was really hoping to find a nice versatile fall dress it was a let down but i still may consider purchasing it because the material was so soft and it f
10472,1.0,i was told by my friends that these do not last more than months but i bought them anyway only to find out they were right no one attends the customer care number so that is of no use do not buy
10473,3.0,its ok it can do a lot of cute things but what it cant do is text or call my family using bluetooth like the commercials make it seem it only does that if the other person has one thats stupid cause im loading the app in my phone so why not access my permissions and send a textam i keeping it yes cause its inexpensive and i liked the apps but people should know before they buy that phone calls and texts dont work unless the other person has it

10482,5.0,its million dollar content worthy book to workout on english vocabulary
10483,2.0,the cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material but the dress itself is extremely thin the nonbelted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress which was enormous in my normal size
10484,3.0,an average phone the mp camera only works in a particular mode and mostly it is a mp camera which works there is no way to change the settings for taking pics night shots are average battery is very good as is the interface quite disappointed by the phone in view of the aggressive marketing samsung took

10488,3.0,overall a very nice and unique dress it does have too much going on but can be worn in a versatile way and if you are small chested without a bra i am not a big fan of the material i wish it was softer it definitely has a gypsiebohemian look if that is what you are looking for

10495,2.0,im not usually a fan of organix products and this conditioning mask is no different first let me say that i do like the organix moroccan oil line this product however did not leave my hair in any better condition than saywhite rain conditioner seriously this is supposed to be a moisturizing mask my hair felt super dry and tangled after leaving this mask on for minutes my hair doesnt feel or look repaired whatsoever i used up the whole product just because of principal but i will not repurchase two products from organix that are absolute gold are the moroccan oil condiyioner and the styling oil all of their other products are drying and damaging in my opinion
10496,3.0,i buy this phone in rs but in this phone only sim slot found where is nd sim slot
10497,2.0,i bought gb version of the card to use with gopro hero black edition it didnt work out the card worked ok if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates eg worked fine in p with protune on or p with protune off however in p with protune on bitrate is just shy of mbs in this mode much higher then with protune turned off it was nothing but trouble camera would sometime work and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason i first suspected camera but testing with different sd cards it ended up being sandisks card that was at fault my spare card an old and cheap gb pny also class worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settingsonce it was obvious it was problem with the card i found people on gopros forums that had trouble with this specific card as well well you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself right anyhow i did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of gb file full of zeros using unix dd utility to copy gb of zeros from devzero where else would you find that many zeros onto a file on the card the result was that on average sandisks card would manage about mbs just barely above the bar for class card however that was average over gb during the write test the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops drops were as low as mbs uh i thought write speed of class card should never dip below mbs for comparison my old cheap class pny card was chugging along at constant mbs under the same test no spikes and no drops in speedthe card will probably work fine in most devices as bitrates when recording p video are often low enough andor camera might have huge buffer but if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates and your device doesnt have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card you may run into trouble be wary of using it in hero in modes that have higher bit rates eg p with protune enabledsandisks website lists part numbers as sdsdquig with adapter and sdsdquag without adapter this conflicts with product description on amazon while this is likely just amazon not getting product description right again a bit too common thing its interesting to noteupdate apr some numbers from testing the card the test is extremely simple write out gb of zeros onto the card using standard unix dd command to read kb blocks of zeroes from special device devzero and write it onto the card kb gb dd displays transfer stats once it finishes while dd was running i run iostat in second terminal displaying second interval stats as a measure of current speed this was done on the mac dd command line can be used asis to repeat test on linux system however iostat command is different on linux and would need to be modified slightly i choose kb block size as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow using different block sizes results are comparable dd ifdevzero oftest bs count records in records out bytes transferred in secs bytessecso mbs and all is good right wrong iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this iostat d w diskdiskkbt tps mbs and so on until dd finishes writing gb of zeros to the card imo the last column should never dip under mbs for card labeled classfor comparison same test run against samsung pro gb microsd card dd ifdevzero oftest bs count records in records out bytes transferred in secs bytessec iostat d w diskdiskkbt tps mbs and so on until dd finishes writing gb of zeros to the card so samsung is on average x faster but more importantly its speed is much more constant and critically important it never dips under mbs

10561,1.0,this item was purchased in aug and this is only oct it has already quit working i wouldnt recommend buying this from amazon
10562,1.0,phone got slow after using just for days it started showing memory full error
10563,4.0,i ordered the green version in size xl i knew it was cropped and it fits me as shown on the models so i think thats true to size the knit is very soft but its the color thats amazingsuch a rich bright emerald green i love the look of it its awkward fitting on my pearshape i layer a long tank underneath with this on top but the hemline of the sweater cuts at an unflattering place still the softness and the beautiful color make it a staple in my closet when im staying at home
10564,2.0,love the top but very small to the size ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for xlarge
10565,5.0,though the product is small it produces sound of extreme quality it can easily cover up rooms due to its small size you can take it anywhereand its battery is excellenti played it continuously for hrs excellent product highly recommended portable product
10566,5.0,i saw this online and liked it but then tried it on in a store a few weeks later and the pictures truly do not do this gem of a dress justice the fit is flowy but tts as the cotton lining underneath fits closer to the body its an incredibly comfortable and easy piece to wear the first day i wore this i received so many compliments the colors are vibrant and its really just a unique piece with beautiful detailing from the embroidery on the top of the dress to the beads on the ties on the
10567,2.0,i really liked this dress in pictures online i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays everything about this dress was a disappointment especially at this price point the fit was weird tight in some places too loose in others im usually xs or s i ordered this one is s its made out of a fairly thick and warm material yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures especially in the back making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck upper b
10568,1.0,its barely been months since we got the phone and the charging cable doesnt work the wire looks to be in perfect condition but doesnt charge we had a complete iphone blackout and no way to contact anyone till we bought a new cable shoddy shoddy shoddy didnt expect this kind of quality i highly recommend that you get a backup charging cable to be on the safe side
10569,3.0,loved this shirt but it runs pretty big im normally a smmed due to bust size ddd and ordered a small based on other reviews could have gotten an xsmall debating going to exchange i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale better quality than some at retailer
10570,3.0,ive noticed this sports bra several times in my storealong with a whole line of products that share this fabric and didnt feel necessarily compelled to try it on but i finally did this last time at retailer i pretty much predicted what i was going to think of it i like the back with the extra strappy open section but that is where it ends the fabric is not particularly flattering and i didnt think the bra accentuated my chest i do have a small bust size but i have a lot of sports
10571,2.0,i wanted to love this sweater the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful however when i put it on it added at least pounds to my frame unfortunately its going back since the cut just doesnt work on my frame

10577,1.0,worst product from hp performance is too slow applications hangs frequently i got defective one in which speaker head phone was not working warranty was also not showing as one year
10578,2.0,ok so ive tried multiple kinds of the organix shampoos and conditioners every single bottle the cap broke off after like the second use i do not care for them at all they leave my hair limp lifeless and greasy i have long blonde hair that is fine for reference they do not add of their claimed benefits to my hair its not the worst drugstore shampoo and conditioner out there but it isnt for me
10579,3.0,a little disappointed as the shiny black catches fingerprints and scratches significantly matt finish as given in space grey wd have added class to the phone
10580,2.0,the designshape of the dress are quite flattering flirty and feminine but there is no way that the dress i received is new the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area there is no tag the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp stiff or new i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received undoubtedly this one is going back dear retailer please make sure that you do not send preowend clothing articles to
10581,2.0,the quality and fabric of this dress are lovely but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless it fit me like a sack i ordered the m and i suppose i shouldve sized down but even in the s im afraid this would be far too large for reference i am and lbs i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasnt right on me i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure returned
10582,4.0,the product is very good but i am giving it star bcz its not that much water proof as companired to asus zenfone max pro m m the camera finger print sensor are actually better than other phones in this price range even better than those previously mentioned asus phones but for me water proof is more important than camera
10583,5.0,this is an adorable top i had to have it in both colors it has a unique shape to it and the simple details give it so much appeal the beautiful fall like colors can be layered easily into the cooler weather of the season
10584,1.0,i received a product which has fingerprint detached from the body means its not fully connected and i ordered replacement the pathetic one i received now just an upgrade for the damage not only fingerprint scanner i have buttons all around my phone wherever i click on the body i can here clicking sound

10586,1.0,this is very third class productno one reply on customer care dont buy
10587,3.0,charger poor quality in minutes become hot zero interest it on emi it is wrong on everyone emi charge some into on installment
10588,4.0,initially when i inserted the card into the samsung galaxy s it recognized it but it wasnt able to format it correctly after doing some research i found a free program easeus partition master that will format the card into fat since windows no longer allows you to do it by default after formatting it into fat the phone recognized the card and it works great now i hope this helps anyone else that might run into this problem
10589,2.0,this tunic looks awesome in the picture however it is made of an uncomfortable sweaterlike material not left of centers normal skin cotton i was disappointed once i saw this in person not a great material for summer
10590,4.0,i have both the shampoo and conditioner for this scent and so far so good my favorite thing about this product is the scent it is a wonderful cherry blossom scent its more of a pure cherry blossom scent than the ginseng and cherry blossom one from the same company and its not as woody or musky as some quotjapanese cherry blossomquot type scents can be im thinking mainly of the japanese cherry blossom scent from bath and body works on top of having a nice scent this shampoo and conditioner has wonderful lasting power i washed my hair almost hours ago and i still get nice wafts of the scent when my hair moves and the scent is very present when i actually go to sniff the hair and in addition to that i have even put products in my hair after washing it and the cherry blossom scent shines through i love it i have read other reviews of this product saying that its not as hydrating as some of the other ogx shampoos and conditioners as well as lamenting the fact that theres not some sort of serum with a matching scent for those two concerns what i can say is that i havent noticed the shampoo or conditioner being particularly lacking in moisturizing qualities however i often do coconut oil hair masks on my hair because of previous bleach damage so that could be a part of it but this shampoo and conditioner is moisturizing enough for my needs and as far as a serum or oil goes ive been using the coconut water dry oil from ogx as well as the occasional argan oil treatment and ive always been able to smell the scent of this shampoo even through the scent of the other products it is very persistent
10591,2.0,ive been eyeing this dress for months so when it went on sale i finally purchased it now i see why its on sale the dress runs extremely large and has no shape looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moomoo in it this will be going back to the store
10592,5.0,purchase for hp tablet to have more memory for music download pictures and video have enough room to store and some memory left over
10593,5.0,works well in my galaxy note ii ive bought many sandisk memory cards and never experienced a failure even the mb sd card purchased for a palm pilot still works
10594,2.0,i absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black wore it times on hot summer days and it was perfect very comfortable easy to throw on and dress up or down i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning as i usually do and after hanging dry it became significantly more translucent than it had been before i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it its as though the fabric completely changed after being wet
10595,3.0,i wanted to like this top as i usually adore a cute peplum feature when i tried it on yesterday in the store i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it i am petite lbs and i tried my usual xs the fabric was substantial and of a high quality but unfortunately in this design that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing
10596,1.0,bed
10597,3.0,i tried this on in the store i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight the material was a little itchy on me but maybe its because the chest was tight the color is lovely pink im sure someone will love it but if you are petite i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty
10598,5.0,just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it its totally different than your typical tee the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings my favorite part is the t strap in the back such a beautiful detail and so much fun my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust im a little more full figured so the top looks better on me when the silk part isnt under my boobs kinda have
10599,2.0,sound is not good now a day mobiles have same quality sounds
10600,2.0,its a really terrible experienced with mi a battery life is so disappointing need to charge times a day even dont play any games manufacturer should fix these problem otherwise its very hard to continue with these phone and need to drop and move to other brand camera is also stuck when clicking continuesly pic dont know why overall very bad expirience to have these not satisfying service these time
10601,2.0,i purchased this sweater in my usual xs but found the silhouette to be way more tentlike than pictured on the model the knit is pretty stiff too so the sweater didnt lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape also the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece i am fairly small but lately im finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs i know im not that tiny maybe this wou
10602,3.0,sound quality is average not much impressing
10603,3.0,really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me
10604,4.0,perfect tv great colors and viewing experience watts speaker does fair job at home but sony wont give any android update
10605,2.0,this top was supposed to be inches long in petite its actually inches long its also large in width hard to believe its an extra small petite
10606,3.0,prodcut is good but overall performances is not upto the mark speakers are not good and facerecogntion is not good
10607,1.0,very worst
10608,2.0,i ask lexus a question and but takes times pushing the button to get any acknowledgement of my question its always plugged in but no response to questions
10609,5.0,its just so easy this little dot was streaming music and telling me the weather within minutes of it arriving i was attracted to the echo for its better speakers but i just connected my dot to my sound bar via bluetooth and it knocked me back on my heels the dot still sounds good alone for taking up about as much table space as a coffee mug its surprising how much comes out of italexa is so useful and versatile that i could not begin to list the features i use on a regular basis being blind myself i can testify to alexas importance as the type of adaptive technology disabled persons dont even know they need in their lives if you know someone who needs help with reding the headlines tuning into the local radeo station keeping up with favorite sports teams remembering shopping list items knowing the datetime setting alarms and reminders or tracking calendar events then give them a dot to connect to their wifi its about as complicated as talking to a grandchild sometimes you have to repeat yourself and speak clearly you do have to learn how to get through to alexa but the more you do it the easier it getsim in the process of connecting my dot to my mobile phone and its contacts alexa remind me to call mom at pm alexa call mom
10610,2.0,guarantee is not sure in india
10611,4.0,it was awesome book
10612,3.0,this is good but not suitable for k video specially for drone video
10613,1.0,not recommended for use
10614,5.0,awesome phone great
10615,5.0,so if you want to buy this product read the review and decide yourself this review will getting little longer but after reading you will know everything about this looks and buildtrust me guys under k this is the best design no smartphone offering you this type of design yes its build is made of plastic but under k you cannot expect better than this even its plastic then also its feel solid yes it can take scratches easily so i will recommend you to buy a back cover for your smartphone even mid range phone get scratches so easily camera now camera is the thing which many people likes and dislikes but in my opinion under k this camera is best talking about the front camera it is even impressive the qualities actually true megapixel and the rear camera according to price its decent not so good but not so bad its actually work fine with this budget category phone according to me you cannot expect more than this in this price battery in todays smartphone battery is the major problem that its not even last for a day but under the budget of k mah battery is not bad under the moderate usage it can last upto a day battery is pretty decent performance this phone is powered by mediatek helio a quad core processor which is clocked at speed of gigahertz and according to this price range this processor is good for this phone it can easily handle your daily work like social networking playing games medium graphic one all other small works you need to kept in mind that this phone price only rupees so you cannot expect more than this now some people will say that gb ram and gb storage is low and we cannot use this phone smoothly but in my opinion if you want this phone for light use then this will not create problem for you but for heavy users who wishes to play pubg on it thats not for you guys but you know the fun fact you can play pubg on low graphic setting on this device and also if you are that type of person who downloading apps and apps multiple apps on your smartphone daily then this device is not for you display under this price range this display is best nothing to say anything more important i read many reviews on amazon and people are saying that the smartphone is bad its sound quality is not good its battery backup is not good its build quality is not good according to me they want more in this price range but in my opinion you cannot get this much in k in last lets take my verdict if you want phone for lite use not for heavy purpose then this phone is made for you but in any case if you want a little better smartphone then this you can pay rupees extra and grab the realme c real me c is also good value for money option for you yes you can play pubg on it
10616,2.0,st not giving earphone in the box this is very bad nd selfie camera according to mp is just like mp bad selfie experience rd overall in this price other better option are there
10617,4.0,i caught this on sale and bought the light pink version it is very lightweight and delicate i must admit on taking it out of the box i was a little concerned at the shape design but once i tried it on i found it draped beautifully and was really a good buy it is very unique and i think i could wear it with nice slacks for work or keep it more casual with jeans and a tshirt on the weekend the only drawback is that the material is not what you would expect from a sweater it does feel more
10618,4.0,bought this on sale in my reg size im and about c the fabric is heavy and pretty this is a more formal top in my opinion it is lined it is much wider around the waist than appears on model zips up the back but i can pull on and off without unzipping
10619,5.0,pretty cool i use for music
10620,4.0,received delivery within days good but i watch battery work only for hours or less at the same time it consume mobile battery so you have to carru two charger at the same time
10621,4.0,wow awasome battery i tested the battery first as soon as it arrived after of charge i started updating phone downloading pubg cod and other apps i played lots of games movie youtub and watapp and lots of calls i was amazed with the performance of the battery life after full charge it lastes for more than hours of heavy use no heating issues its really an monster i just purchased this mobile for my secondary use but now it has became my primary mobile for day to day life i m an apple user i have iphone plus for past years but now its just put aside i m happy with this monster camera can be improved apart form that i would recommend others to buy this phone thanks to flipkart and samsung
10622,5.0,greatits speed is okand work fine
10623,4.0,nicebut back cover poor
10624,5.0,unlike the first three reviews i loved this sweater the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable fits trus to size
10625,5.0,best in class from and very fast delivery from amazon
10626,3.0,very thick cable charging ok
10627,5.0,best option to buy shinco in this budget shinco have specialized inbuilt sound bar which is far better than mis or vu and picture quality is very satisfying with vivid colours sleek design and installation is fast they have their own software and doesnt work on android star for shinco tv
10628,2.0,i splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it even though the design is adorable the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear after a month and a couple washes it looks horrible and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well so so disappointed the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch i could have easily sized down
10629,3.0,camera is good and build is great battery is worst for users who want to make it their daily driver just dont think about it worst battery life
10630,3.0,this is insane evev we could not get tv for k we got a tv thanks to amazon
10631,1.0,this is a product review purchased from offline market and not online so no fault of amazon screen opened up automatically on one of the corners of asus tuf fx gd worth inr happened this within days of purchase no replacement even after multiple follow ups service center repair also did not work screen is opening up again and inside hardware is showing service centers are not aware of the issue worst customer service ever no value for money and customers time guys please dont buy asus laptops go for other brands

10633,4.0,its fall and time to put in an effort to a more pulled together look so i wanted to do something for my hair without actually color processing it i have naturally dark brown hair with very subtle highlights which takes on color easily so a color depositing shampoo made sense i really wanted loreal colorist collection but couldnt get it close to where i live hence went with this one i have to say it works quite well its a pretty decent shampoo so first my hair gets clean and then it brings out the colors very naturally i couldnt get the conditioner but will make do with my trusty garnier which worked out well very pleased with the results
10634,4.0,the fabric is quite thin and sheer it runs a little small also that being said they are really beautiful pants especially on sale
10635,2.0,not enough voice
10636,5.0,excellent product needs some skills training and work with additional accessories but a huge step forward in home automation
10637,4.0,beautiful dress but i had to returned because the size large was a little big
10638,3.0,runs large very stretchy nice wash mine had more holes and fraying in the legs than i expected i returned them because i got the wrong size and smaller sizes are sold out otherwise a cute jean and with the sale certainly worth it
10639,3.0,a cute top the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist for my curvy figure this isnt always the case i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta but definitely needed a large i ordered the lavender color which is disappointing a dull gray ive decided to return and order the coral instead
10640,3.0,gb ram is not good for gaming it very heating when i installed pubg actually my device have this problem or i dont know but it is best for web surfing and hd video mp also its speaker quality is good in that price
10641,1.0,the phone is good but the worst thing about this is its battery i got this this phone on the battery was decaying very fast even when kept idle got it replaced the new phone also gave the same result if possible i would have given for the battery please dont buy redmi pro my personal suggestion redmi has let me down after many positive reviews of redmi phones i bought this one and got total loss from the company
10642,1.0,very very bad camera and worst battery dont buy this product and it is worth less for the amount
10643,2.0,sctrachy short boxy stiff loved the idea of this sweater but this was not what i was hoping for
10644,5.0,as the description suggests the phone has an amazing battery life i binge watch series play games surf on social media and the phone goes on without charging for almost days i can go on long trips without bothering to take the power bank i am yet to purchase a cover and glass however i did drop the phone down and it survived no broken peices or scratches on the screen so fair to say it survived the drop test the screen clarity is great this can be seen especially when you play games on this phone i took some time getting used to the ui of this phone as the phone i previously had was not this updated however within two days i was able to navigate easily the camera of this phone is good however not the best ive seen it taken good photos if the subject is near however if the subject is far the photos come out a little blurry in conclusion i would say this phone is worth every penny spent on it i bought this phone during the amazon great indian festival and thus got a good discount too
10645,5.0,all good except battery life as usual
10646,4.0,durability is poor didnt last more than a year the cables fray at the join point to the ear buds and the mic performance is subpar fails within months cables material is not good either
10647,5.0,this is a beautiful dress and my husband agrees im lb and the xs was long on me and a bit baggy on top i looked in to having it taken up but i think that will be hard to do without damaging much of whats elegant about the dress i hope that someone with more curves and a bit more height is able to enjoy this one
10648,5.0,very nice to see the new product delivered to me thanks for amazon your trust level is increasing day by day keep up the good work
10649,3.0,i had high hopes for this coat but it was a miss for me while the wool is soft and not itchy the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy also the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was but alas i just could not get over the poor tailoring for reference i am usually a pxxs ftin lbs and it was big
10650,5.0,this kevin inch smart tv has all the features that other branded tvs have at a very high price above k inr but this tv that i purchased for just inr made my day it has surround dts sound ips wide angle display wifi youtube hotstar netflix smart remote using mobile fhd playback screen cast keyboard and mouse usage and a lots more stuff that you didnt ever thought of in this price i am in love with this tv thank you kevin for such a wonderful product and yes also its remote is damn awesome in one word just go for it
10651,3.0,this t is a beautiful color and i wish it had worked it is quite flimsy however very thin cotton fabric without the nice drape that would have made this look good on i also think it should have been cut a little longer it flares out right at the hipsso instead of covering them it highlights them im disappointed and am returning it
10652,4.0,good product with moderate priceusing from last daysrecommend to buy
10653,2.0,i am the owner of two google home speakers and only received the dot through dish network even though i an an admitted google guy i gave alexa a chance technologically it seems all these products are on the same track but i think the sound is far inferior to the google home i also had an easier time with setup on the google home
10654,5.0,great price
10655,1.0,this item is faulty make a sure first refund bolne ke bad bolte hain ki ye send karo o send kro quality is not goodservices is very bad amazon is not good work customer is not satisfied amazon killer
10656,4.0,these are nice cords albeit they look slightly more faded in person i like the style high waist and the cropped flare which actually fit me perfectly as regular length since i am they do run small i am normally a and the fit perfectly
10657,1.0,i generally dont write bad reviews but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost the design and colors are great but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturers tag is at the back of the neck the material is very thin so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment i shop at retailer all the time and this is not a item of clothing
10658,2.0,battery is draining and speaker also give trouble
10659,1.0,not much useful only audio quality is good
10660,2.0,i have bought this mobile indian great sale first days battery was very nice day by day battery performance was less and its draining fast and charging time also getting more full charge takes hours very worst camera signal efficiency also very worst this is not monster this is very worst mobile in samsung series only the thing is ram and storage and processor is some what good
10661,3.0,i gave it stars but this isnt a bad thing alexa always claiming she doesnt know something i think she has the potential of being great once i get to know her better sometimes she doesnt listen no matter how many times i called her name she will light up blue and green and the same time and do not say anything i have to unplug her and start again also my daughter likes talking to alexa and alexa always seem to respond with some type of info even though my daughter just mumbles but somehow alexa put together what she just heard even though its mumbles lol she just told us the capital of france or something like that im sure my daughter did not ask what is the capital of france lol as i said before i am still learning her but she has got to stop trying to figure out my daughter mumbles lol

10663,4.0,sound quality is good its better to listen vocal music as it does have that powerful bass as compared to other headphones i wont recommend this for bass and edm lovers but still in d end its jbl
10664,2.0,white colour is displayed more then other colours like black and white tvs
10665,2.0,this is huge i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape there is no shape to this and is a lot of material i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses sometimes medium in sweaters it seamed like sizes too big the material is very soft and the collar is nice there is a ribbon tie at the waist the tie is wimpy and could be nicer when tied there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist
10666,3.0,iphone x display is good but battery isnt that great and after using months i felt unsatisfied because of battery and some times some apps wont work because they are not fully optimised for this notch display

10669,4.0,faulty mobile i couldnt refund the mobile since opened the package after one month
10670,3.0,overall the laptop is pretty good in contrary of being a gaming laptop it looks sleek but gets heated easily after normal use for a certain period of time that is the main issue

10672,3.0,this piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms or if you are a trex if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms this top may not be for you
10673,5.0,honor x gb gb best rear cam awesome display slim phone attractive display go for it
10674,3.0,i loved the fabric cut and style of these shirts the diamond gather in the front is a problem though i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit this shirt washes and wears wonderfully please make again maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker sill i love this top
10675,5.0,i love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work its very comfortable and light
10676,2.0,not good product
10677,3.0,good book to read and revise good for beginer
10678,2.0,mobile very durty product camera clariety very poor finger print not working mi a performance very poor some time hanging mobile
10679,3.0,i will keep it short phone hangs when you play apps that consume heavy ram eg google apps this is beacuse of the processor not that it should be expected from a mobile phone of range k but this is one of the drawback if any camera is decent i think it edits too much which hides the natural texture beauty i have never been fan of too much edited photos anyway battery is good last full day with normal usage phone overall does decent job for the price i think it is good i will give it considered everything
10680,2.0,i ordered these pants in my usual size xl and was shocked when i received them the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up i couldnt keep them on so of course back they go too bad the sweater quality is great
10681,4.0,the product is not only good but like outstanding item in limited budget so i am happy thank you amazon mi also
10682,3.0,the speaker of the phone stops working only after month of use without any reason so the quality of the product is sceptical
10683,4.0,i ordered the kevin smart tv on the product was delivered on november ndbut unfortunately the tv display was damaged i complaint to amazon and tv manufacturer they are immediate action on my complaint and assured to replacement for the tv so i thanks to amazon india and the beston skyvision they are save my money now i and my family is very satisfied we are proud of amazon and beston skyvision entire team we thankful to them with best regards manikandan ulaganathan
10684,1.0,i have made a mistake to buy it within days it stopped cooling even on highest setting waiting for the repair nowreally heartbreaking
10685,4.0,but the back of it by the waist bunches just a tiny bit if i get bigger it will be too long but i love the skirt it is flattering and cute not itchy for me even if the title says wool i ordered the p and the length is pretty much as pictured just below the knee in front the waist is snug bigger it would fall more on my hips hence the too long comment earlier lbs in waist short legs
10686,3.0,the reason i am giving this stars is because of its screen glass quality you will see that even if you by mistake drop it because of its slippery back you get few cracks on the screen they have put a bad quality screen on it and the sound is also not upto the mark you can hear echo while on a phone call so please think twice before using your samsung ms if high as the parts are not of that great quality

10698,4.0,we use it in our kitchen for a little entertainment music is ok the jokes are so bad you sometime s chuckle and the convenience of the timer and measurement calculation is good but no other uses then that
10699,5.0,i love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large really it just depends on how you want it to fit the length is great too about inches above my knee im foot which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit i got the
10700,5.0,im small and lbsand the petite xxs fits really well the fabric feels soft too i cant wait for warmer weather so i can wear this

10703,2.0,normal product
10704,5.0,love love love these the model does not do them justice since she makes them look like high rise pants they are very soft with stretch which is why i sized down i usually wear a you can remove the roll and they fit perfect w a heel for those curvy women they look great also have a slouchy appeal too but tailored i went everywhere looking for chinos and these are the best ones out there for reference i am pounds and just losing weight from having a baby and absolutely
10705,5.0,ultimate phone
10706,3.0,this top is just as beautiful in person as online however it has two issues for me it is too short this might work if you have a short torso but it would forever show my stomach the fabric has way too much static cling no matter what i tried it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides not attractive in short if you have a short torso and dont mind battling the static this truly is a beautiful top
10707,3.0,i love the idea of alexa and the dot but we have to unplug her more often than not due to her disconnecting or trying to answer the tv its not as convenient as it should be
10708,4.0,i like this product camera quality is good battery backup is also good some issue in fingerprint reader some times not working properly
10709,5.0,these pants are great the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater another great find from retailer
10710,1.0,received i phone but speaker doesnt work looks like a defective piece
10711,2.0,the review is based upon my month of usage pros this band makes the person standing in front of u to look at ur wrist for a while for its unique look very stylish comfortable n light weight can use it during a shower as well cons sleep tracking is very bad doesnt pair with bluetooth versions of but company is claiming that it should battery life is not more than days even when not connected with a phone so if u r a beginner then u can buy it
10712,2.0,the screen quality is really bad enough to break in the first fall previous redmi s had fallen times still the screen was intact i replaced the screen which again broke without a fall
10713,3.0,this is really cute online but is not fantastic on or in person this is a top that i may be returning i love the open shoulder but the material is very thin and the top runs large it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of
10714,2.0,worst for design purpose

10716,2.0,i am not satisfied i think this is not original product
10717,3.0,best for this price range looks stylish using this for last days quick review camera too good however little time lag while taking pics battery good ui good yet to use extensively outside so to understand display quality under sun nevertheless inside its best display sound can be little better network connectivity is bad specially internet used this for a days and realised after cross checking with other phones in same area and same isp face lock has issues setting it up
10718,1.0,it keeps restarting

10725,3.0,mobile is not getting connected to wifi few futures are disable not allowing to enable those features
10726,5.0,perfect purchase glad to see its performance very happy correct purchase
10727,2.0,smells good but it is very drying and not at all hydrating for my thick and wavy hair i am a sucker for citrus scented products so i picked up this with the matching conditioner bogof it too smells good but lacks moisturizing qualities would be very annoyed if i had paid full price for it
10728,4.0,the delivery of the product was faster and i didnt expect it i really appreciate that
10729,1.0,worst product ever buyed it stopped working after month
10730,1.0,software issues with wifi
10731,2.0,i ordered this online and took it back the day i got it i could not fit the neck hole over my head therefore i couldnt even see how it truly fit i had high hopes for this dress
10732,2.0,the only thing i liked about this was the fragrance which is lovely and lingers ill use this up eventually as a now and then body wash but would not use on my hair again or repurchase it was hard to lather and unimpressive often left my hair dry and straw like nothing about this felt quotnourishingquot in the least
10733,4.0,fridge is functioning good i liked it
10734,5.0,beautiful superb sound best product beat service
10735,5.0,this dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did perfect dress for work and going out the petite hits me midthigh like in the photo
10736,4.0,these are form fitting and have a great wash the size runs large so i would say consider to go down one size than you usually wear the bottom tapers so they are great to wear wtih flats or can easily fit into boots
10737,2.0,i tried this shirt in the purple motif it fit true to size my normal small worked well all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in really on a white shirt it annoyed me so much i didnt buy the shirt
10738,2.0,bluetooth not working properly
10739,2.0,their is problem invalid devise imei no
10740,4.0,this is a fairly high quality tank which i purchased in bluegreen its narrower at the top more voluminous at the bottom and a heavier knit than i expected so im a little concerned about stretching over time but ill be careful washing it and enjoy it till that day does or doesnt come
10741,4.0,best investment planning on getting another now that you can stream audio through all connected echo devices
10742,1.0,i have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was off i ordered a size m petite sadly when it arrived and i tried it on it was very boxy stiff like and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back
10743,3.0,the phone is good for low budget buyers the battery life is amazing camera quality even though it promises mp isnt that upto the mark but like mentioned before it is enough for low budget buyers fingerprint sensor and face unlock is of good speed and works well
10744,3.0,repititive
10745,2.0,i wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed first the pink was way to sheer for my liking the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks
10746,2.0,at this point there is lots of software bug in this tv automatically restart periodically bluetooth not working properly while connect to bluetooth earphone no option for hdmi or av set on startup cast screen disconnect every time no option to switch between apps
10747,5.0,good phone one charge your phone in morning and forget to carry charger with you
10748,1.0,purchased for my android phone to provide more media storage the one i received was doa spoke with sandisk tech support who confirmed that it was a bad unit since it was within days they suggested i return it to amazon instead of going through warranty procedures i returned it to amazon but made the mistake of requesting a replacement instead of a refund the replacement appeared to work at first but after a short while it caused my phone to reboot files went missing and displayed other forms of instability it was a bit late to return again so i contacted sandisk who replaced the unit under the warranty however this all took a lot of time necessitated repeated copying of many gbs of data and secure erasing of informationthe warranty replacement from sandisk works well so far however im not seeing much improvement in my application over a similar gb class sandisk microsdhc this one is class would probably give the current unit stars but this rating is for the amazon delivered units both defectiveif you do get a bad one id suggest to return for refund not replacement
10749,1.0,i got only mbps write speed and mbps read speed only i think actually this was a gb class memory card and modified as a class this is the truth because class means that will provide a constant writing of mbps minimum but up to mbps a class memory card will provide mbps minimum writing speed but up to mbps in this cause i got very similar speed of a gb class memory card from ultra version
10750,3.0,overall good product
10751,3.0,its an alright product nothing special kind of weighs my hair down the smell is amazing though
10752,1.0,worst mobile dont buy please
10753,4.0,it works well it automatically pairs to my bluetooth soundbar when my bluetooth soundbar is on bluetooth mode but is smart enough not to when it is not i only wish the sound quality was better but for the price its acceptable
10754,3.0,there isnt much shape to this dress its fairly straight from top to bottom im smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much im and lbs and bought a pxs for reference also i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it

10768,4.0,good product as promised by mi
10769,1.0,this dress is so short i double checked to make sure i didnt get a petite by mistake im and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck it fit well on top but you could see my underwear in the front seriously i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didnt work out
10770,5.0,love these shorts got pairs on sale just because its hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length

10779,3.0,it was ok very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc its definitely not worth
10780,5.0,i tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress with very interestingly cut seams the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract gorgeous and high quality fit i am and curvy usually a size and the xl fits quite roomy on me thats the size i ordered because i like flowy things so it definitely runs large usually i have better luck with aline dress shap
10781,1.0,dual sim is not working
10782,2.0,kind of works but not enough product make and the sound quality are good auxout was a major reason to choose alexa over ghome basic stuff like alarmtimer etc are okay but that is it many times the device doesnt listen to me specially when it is playing music and i end up calling alexa times going closer each time to get the attention if i had to go all the while to the equipment to say next or reduce volume what is the benefit over any normal music player and when it listens it recognizes wrong atleast half of the time initially i thought it is with the regional language songmovie name but then found the problem with perfect english dictionary words also mercury as fury and mp as mpa my accent must be really bad so basically i have to struggle for minutes to get an intended song played i did get the plex server setup in my pc to stream local music to alexa not at a level of selecting songs with voice commands yet but atleast i get a playlist of my choice played most of the time i have to use specific commands itself natural language processing seems far far away you will need a lot of patience to deal with alexa
10783,3.0,i thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews for me there were a few key things off for it to work i thought the material was soft although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress i ordered a small and the top fit ok the arms were a little tight then the larger problem was the body it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there it didnt do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa
10784,1.0,very poor display quality
10785,4.0,good book for competitive exams
10786,4.0,the material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners i like it and have already worn it a few times
10787,1.0,material is too thin and quality is poor
10788,1.0,please do not buy this phone sumsung is claiming the false statement that it can last up to hrs of video playback normal use battery is last up to to hrs only normal use means some whats app few minutes call few minutes video only check the screen shot after charging the battery it shows only hrs and minutes i dont understand why samsung is claiming the false battery life hrs video playback hrs music hrs voice call amazon should check the product before they put this on sell cameras front and back are ok i am very very disappointed with this device amazon please help me to resolve my issue
10789,2.0,after using it for month the charging port got damaged the device is not charging now
10790,2.0,okok
10791,2.0,i had such high hopes for this blouse as it looks totally stunning online however its not as pictureddescribed in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat but rather hd in paris for the price the quality is just not thereive seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less i returned it without a second thought
10792,4.0,love this dress i wear a size large but had to return and order a medium planning to wear with boots its a light dress cute for work the only downside is that it wrinkles easily
10793,3.0,i love the smell of this and i love that it feels like nothing at all what i do not like is how thin it is when you put it on no matter how much you shake it the after effects are worth it though
10794,1.0,the jeans look so different online the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut the rise is not as stated and is actually inches also im a true and the waist is like a but the legs are super skinny im so disappointed and im not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size these look more like mens cut jeans
10795,2.0,i ordered these in m lbs and they are tts they fit well and are neither tight nor loose the issue that i have with them and the reason that i sent them back is that the material although comfortable is completely transparent if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless furthermore these are not white but offwhite and quite a yellowy offwhite at that so these loungers dont look as cute with the feature
10796,2.0,a very useless phone cameras are already having dust particles in it very bad battery life ever phones connector is not good even though it is having almost stock android it lags a lot while booting takes lot of time over all you can understand the reason of giving big discount
10797,4.0,price was right shipping quick class card for hd video in my goprohard to rate it since memory cards are pretty much memory cards nothing jumps out as excellent so that is why of
10798,5.0,i was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a springsummer item but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders
10799,2.0,this speaker sucks i have used jbl flip and soundsticks by harman so i know about soundthis portable speaker is useless and not loud and not clear it is much better to go for fenda swan as it deliver richer low end and better mids also the sound signature is wide and surrounding also it has micro sd and much better sound stagechoice is yours
10800,3.0,eh its okay
10801,3.0,better go with high price of mi mobiles
10802,3.0,its just an average phone the sound output is low touch is not quite responsive feels a bit slow during navigation
10803,5.0,i just received this and wore it immediately it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern peeks out giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not seethrough it is a fine knit and has a satinlike thread to it which makes it soft and cool perfect for a summer day it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite lb and i think this would run closer to tts
10804,1.0,oneplus has very poor camera donor get biased by all good reviews it does too much artificial editing and make you look white and smooth no where close to natural photography its good for ugly people who love to post their pic on instagram one who is looking for normal photoplease stay away from this phone
10805,5.0,faces improved good
10806,1.0,the fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth the cut of this vest is also bad will be sent back
10807,2.0,it is just an average phone performance is below par with competitors front camera is below average and you cant play much game on this rear cam is just average bought samsung m only because it was for use by elders otherwise i would have gone for any other brand
10808,4.0,this is a great shirt the ruffles are strategically placed and hide any stomach flaws i get that others are surprised by the arm slits but a couple of well placed stitches will make it very work appropriate or if youre worried about arm waggle the color borders on blacknavy
10809,1.0,after a few months the voice has started breaking and when it is switched off and on then the voice is ok the camera also was good but now the picture quality is very bad
10810,5.0,very flattering cut only con is that is seems to snag easily extremely comfortable and dont need to wear a cami under it like i originally thought i would
10811,2.0,not recommended for other than samsung mobile phone users downloads many plugins even after that doesnt give correct response mobile app doesnt sync properly live tracking not good during workout crown and watch depth gives trouble not recommended
10812,4.0,i really love this skirt when i first tried it on i felt as if it was too thick and bulky for my frame im very slim but my mom convinced me to get it well mother knows best i wore it to church with boots and a blouse and it looked great i received endless compliments its also a modest yet fashionable length
10813,5.0,good memory card for songs films and photos downloading
10814,2.0,this is one fabulouslooking dress however the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a dealbreaker for me i even tried sizing up to see if that would help but it was still too scratchy for me
10815,3.0,specifications of this samsung ms is good but its only in description not in mobile waste of money after days of use i bought gb memory and gb storage positive feedback display is good processing speed of course is ok ok multitasking okok battery is good and battery backup almost day for normal use negative poor front camera quality little heating problem plastic body touch screen slow gaming screen refresh rate not ok feeling over all budget mobile with normal use
10816,2.0,bought it for controlling the television and it works part of the time and not part of the time i also had to buy a harmony hub
10817,4.0,the fabric is lovely and the straight leg cut makes these pants a great option for summer they do run small
10818,2.0,i really wanted to like this jump suit i rarely have problem with retailer clothing im hourglass shape usually wear size this jumpsuit runs small but thats not the only problem top part shirt piece of the jumpsuit is too short so its digging into my lady part the color does not look anything like the picture so overall this piece is failure i hope that i find something similar but fits better
10819,2.0,piece of junk do not buy takes forever to load and play you can browse through channels like tv i have very fast internet connection at home but this device is absolute waste of money

10821,3.0,horrible battery lifejst daysplzzz dont buy thisapart from battery everything is gud enoughbut battery will make u regret ur decision of buying
10822,2.0,i really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isnt for me the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable the fit is not quite right on me the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not it was not very comfortable for me either so this was clearly not a win for me
10823,4.0,i was able to try this on in store thanks to a return it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind even on sale i this wasnt worth the price for me the highlow hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me if this is something you can get mileage out of i really do recommend it well made lovely colors and nice style
10824,1.0,we love the echo but the app is terrible dt this we would not recommend it plus the battery only last about hrs
10825,2.0,poor results in searching
10827,3.0,when i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on it is a pretty dress looked good in the pictures however when i examined it and proceeded to try it on i was really disappointed the quality is ok but not expected for the price paid and the cut is off it is extremely small at the top i am not big by any means dlbs the bottom part fit sadly not impressed this one is going back
10828,4.0,nice model
10829,1.0,low quality product not expected from such big company
10830,3.0,i really wanted this to work the embroidery detail is very pretty however the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank the sweatshirt is also on the short size the small hit the top of my jean waist in the end i decided to return it
10831,5.0,this is nice vale for money
10832,4.0,love the rifle print on this dress the fit is relaxed and very comfortable and can be adjusted with the tie in the back the fabric is a nice weight great for yearround wear

10840,2.0,bed quality mobile hange problem
10841,2.0,this sweater is adorable and comfortable but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything i cannot even imagine trying to wash it unfortunately i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor
10842,5.0,bought this one to add to the standard one i had already purchased for the size and speed and price it was worth it
10843,2.0,speaker is causing problem
10844,1.0,no installation yet poor response
10845,2.0,this sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on

10847,3.0,phone has some lag sometimes will not be able to hear anything during callneed to restart phone and works fine build quality is ok weightless being mah battery its very light camera is great apart from camera i dont like anything in this phone

10849,5.0,using this on my samsung galaxy s it works well and has good readwrite speeds very pleased with this card
10850,4.0,i was lucky enough to get these on sale with an additional off making them a fabulous deal they are nicely made and the shade of blue is very pretty my only complaint and the reason im on the fence is that they are so big i usually buy a in the ag stevie jeans occasionally a so i figured id be safe sizing down to a wrong i could have gone to a and possibly even a theyre that big i do like them though and may just try shrinking them in the dryer
10851,4.0,echo dot is a great option for a home assistant i originally bought a google home but was disappointed slightly by it so i got an echo dot to see if it worked better in general i feel the echo dot is much more reliable than google home with way way more features and it is very nice to just say alexa instead of having to say two words to activate google home seems petty that having to say one extra word would have an affect but it does the echo dot falls to google home a bit in the personality department and as far as general searches and queries go i think google home is superior but those are the only places google home comes out ahead speaker quality and the two systems ability to use the microphones to pick up on you i would say are roughly equal never had a complaint from either really overall had i known then what i know now about smart speakers i wouldnt have bought a google home before an echo
10852,1.0,i am very sad to say that this phone will not be returning back
10853,3.0,did not know what to expect it is interesting to say the least thank you
10854,4.0,this is a lovely dress looks very expensive nice fabric and detail im ft tall lb i normally order a l but got an m color black because other sizes were sold out length wise the dress is a little shorter than it looks on the model but then again im pretty tall you cant really tell on the online photo but this dress has a white undergarment which makes it great because of the see through detail on the fabric size wise i felt like even with an m the dress is oversized it sits we
10855,3.0,the cable works better compared to other cables i purchased more than models but this one really works good the charging power is fast and highly durable its good one to buy for even turbo power chargers
10856,4.0,i tried the green one on in the store as my store only had the green the lace was sort of fuzzylooking and i couldnt tell if the items were shopworn or if the lace was supposed to look like that since they all looked that way i decided it was the look of the original fabric and i tried it on i do like the combination of the lace sleeves and vneck a bit dressy but casual also although i sometimes appreciate a little forgiveness in the tummy area in this case the design was too loose a
10857,2.0,it does not respond of the time i thought it supposed to have such good voice recognition i have to holler at it for it to hear me and i have tried different locations maybe defective dunno would like to get a replacement if possible
10858,1.0,the hardware itself is solid the problem with this product is that it is made worthless by its poor integration with everything on the software side for example perhaps the most common use of this device is adding things to shopping list but the alexa ios app does not link to ios reminders like many apps do and so you have to rely on very very poor thirdparty integration such as ifttt which only works sporadically this is simply amazons stubbornness they have full access to ios reminders api the alternative is to use the alexa app itself the problems with this alternative are obvious the app is terrible and demands so much data to load that it rarely works while on the go similarly the app is extremely clunky when it comes to smart home integration i wish amazon simply made a website with all the alexa features on it so that i can use safari on my phone to configure thingsi think this product like all echo products would become worthwhile once amazon invests in a useful companion app that works and integrates seamlessly with our daily lives for now i am using this product as a sleep alarm which makes it the most expensive sleep alarm ive ever purchased
10859,5.0,phone over all good but meger isu this phone battery fast drain and camra is not good
10860,3.0,but not good in adoptor adaptor is a over heating so oru nalla adoptor realise pannunga adaptor issue is true i am using the mobile phone charge podum pothu adaptor heat aguthu
10861,4.0,this is a very pretty delicate comfortable dress i think it fits tts maybe even a little large i got the ps which is my usual size and it fit perfectly the only complaint i have is that the photo is misleading on the dress i received there was nothing to hook the buttons into no loops as in the photo so the whole front of the dress has to be unbuttoned i wish i was able to button or as in the photo
10862,2.0,i was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail unfortunately the sweater is lined with the same material very soft and warm btw as the polka dots which sheds like crazy i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away very disappointed a lint roller cant even clean up the tshirt in terms of sizing this fits tts i normally wear a l or xl got this in an
10863,5.0,i really love this top i got the ivory and now i will probably get the black too if you get it in your normal size im almost always an xs and got this in xs its fitted and flattering the seam across the sternum makes it feel like an empire top which always seems to look good on me it is fitting in the chest and arms its really lightweight and has sleeves so i will wear this even in summer
10864,3.0,the most important thing for any phone is voice quality it lacks on it
10865,4.0,nice handset but fixture are not best
10866,2.0,battery drains fast processing is slow long boot time below average
10867,3.0,after months would not read at all used all sorts of card readers and computers and internals went completely dead strange for a product from this company but i guess it happens may not happen to you but since its a high capacity would that mean its more susceptible to becoming corrupted would not buy again maybe a gb
10868,5.0,love the echo dots thoigh i do wish they were smarter
10869,5.0,wanted a cooler weather casual weekend errand dress and this is very confortable to wear with artistic leggings and tall boots pockets are always handy and it is easy to style with a contrast scarf or long necklace for added warmth can add a full slip or wear alone in spring with sandals received numerous compliments wearing the first time so purchased the navy one several weeks later anticipate wearing these dresses often and when the cotton finally wears down will use as a nightgown love
10870,3.0,this sweater is fine for the casual days i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old im a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears very soft but poor material not my favorite purchase
10871,2.0,its defect after one week so returned to seller and gets refund

10877,5.0,this top is super cute nice and light for the hot weather with a tts fit the model is wearing a lightcolored bra so it shows through but with a black bra there is no problem
10878,3.0,i have thick coarse dry hair and this gave my hair shinebut not much help with the frizz i doubt i will buy again i also think the scent remminds me with mens shampoowith masculine like fragrance to it i live in humid east texas coast and ogxs kukui bottle mentions this being good for frizz caused by humiditybut not in this case i dont think anything can take on east texas humidity i would not recomment this product to anyone
10879,1.0,this dress ran largemaybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body maybe because i have a short torsopetite frame i loved the yellow color for summerit would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding unfortunately i had to return it
10880,3.0,look wise its too good looks like a classy premium phone camera is fabulous but battery is not up to the mark also it has some lagging issues it may be fixed with some updates
10881,4.0,beautifully made designer sweater and its soft and comfortable i decided to return because its just too much for my body the fringe which is quite long overwhelmed my shape and i looked much larger than i am the color is true white the knit itself is fuzzy it closes with a single button on the placket at the neckline although not for me i do recommend
10882,1.0,well bummer i was really hoping this shampoo would work for me but alas no i agree with another reviewer that said the only thing its got going for it is the smell washing your hair with it is a very pleasant sensory experiencethe formula feels really good on your hair amp hands and it has a warm sugary smell however thats where anything positive ends for me it leaves my hair dry tangly even with a deep conditioner and the ends look stringythin yuck in addition my regular styling products are rendered totally ineffectivei really cant understand how this works for people with the hair type its intended for fine amp thin my hair is babyfine and i dont have a lot of it so my choice of shampoo matters this one is a definite dud for me and i wont repurchase
10883,5.0,cool stuff
10884,5.0,i havent worn jeans in a year because i felt uncomfortable and constrained these are as soft as my leggings they have so much stretch you could do yoga in them if you want the jean look wo the stiffnessstructure get these flattering to the booty too
10885,5.0,this product is good but you tube is not working
10886,5.0,everything about this phone is good except battery life camera is perfect and u wont get a better camera in this price range trust me i have poco f but mi a camera is better
10887,3.0,i bought this mostly to wear around the house so ill keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale that said this runs really large the sleeves are really loose and it doesnt really hang well over my hips which is a shame its very soft and cozy which is nice but i dont think ill leave the house in it often it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling bu
10888,5.0,im surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet ive had it for a couple of months and love it it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf the color is beautifulive gotten many compliments on this too it fits well and has a small texture which makes it more interesting
10889,4.0,i am wearing a medium in the photos my measurements are for reference
10890,4.0,this sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable i really wanted it to work a small fit my lb frame well dd but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end its going back i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip
10891,4.0,nice but battery backup and camera not good
10892,3.0,the color and designstyle are cute but i found this to be too oversized if you want to layer it then it might be for you but i was hoping for more of a tailored look
10893,5.0,the camera quality could be improved becoz of the default camera setting which are putin by samsung shows way too much grains n particles in your photos i do not know whether the iso or saturation or hue could be altered but ut stands no where on comparison to nokia camera superb considering the price range and for quick camera shots when u do not have a proper camera with you the one that shoots sharper n clear images say of a running bike numberplateis the winner just days using this phone display fab amoled wins anyday battery life very nice considering the dusplay oitput on amoled will just put smile on ur face ui u will love it if u r using stock android for long time already using nokia plus gameplay build quality my nokia fell face down quadruple times on thr ground still no issues with the fone running smooth but saw no covers can can protect your samsung screen as i never used samsung before but after using this one considering it is a budget phone under k overall if samsung could provide screen size lije d samsung se that would be perfect to grab in hands and operate and ofcourse in this budget
10894,1.0,a got a defective product the speaker has extremely low sound while calling i cant hear caller voice at all and at last delivery person was arrogant speaking like he was doing favour to me when i called for replacement they were also not helpful now i am why i ordered by amazon i should have ordered by any other e commerce company

10897,2.0,not interesting small font
10898,5.0,got this days ago and have worn it of those days it is a perfect beautiful autumn dress the fabric is textured and slightly colorvaried in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth the fabric is a thin sweater knit because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does nor would it be as figureflattering despite its thinness it is still warm would buy this in oth
10899,1.0,worst mobile in honor phones honor x is the best mobile dont perches honor x mobile the camera is very bad

10904,2.0,ive got this dry oil as a present and because of all the positive reviews i had high hopes my hair is very fine and i need something to make my long hair less frizzy and dry and make it a bit stronger and heavier i dont blow dry or straighten my hair so maybe that is why this dry oil doesnt work for me i have tried it on wet and dry hair and it doesnt deliver the results i am searching for my hair feels as dry and frizzy as before use and becomes also a bit stiff i think because of the keratin and silicones i think the smell is too strong and the package as mentioned before is very unpractical okay it is cheap but for me it does nothing for my hair
10905,2.0,very heat and slowly worked
10906,2.0,material cheap too small good idea for design love princess cut but bad material good idea though sending back
10907,4.0,build quality is good and its battery life is also good but camera quality is a bit low
10908,1.0,veryyy very slow
10909,1.0,what is this item
10910,4.0,phone is gud easy to use and quite a good camera and speed for the price but speaker ringing volume is comparatively low
10911,4.0,reviewing after using for months battery is good low light photography of front cam is bad old processor but good no hanging issue at charging time it will heat otherwise its ok
10912,5.0,the author makes accounting and finance concepts incredibly simple great book for anyone interested in becoming rich or simply improving their financial position
10913,5.0,this dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger the material clings to all the right places and feels really good i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves try it adorable
10914,1.0,battery pack is quite heavy yet it has only k juice what disappointed me even more is that there is no fast charging charging speed is very low in my honor
10915,3.0,i thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it im a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment i was also confused by the front collar ribbing and how it was supposed to lay open folded over partly folded over it just didnt seem to have a particular style to this area
10916,3.0,i love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline wouldnt sit right overall the fit was boxy and unflattering the fabric is pretty but the style is wellboring there was just no wow factor for me i think the fabric deserved a much better design imho i think this top might be better suited fo
10917,3.0,the laptop ia hanging too much and thats too when we are using it for basic surfing no heavy games or apps installed on the laptop took almost minutes to boot
10918,3.0,if it shows bty strenth and comes with long bty life will be more useful
10919,3.0,major cons in this phone its speaker too loud like chinese speaker there is little battery heating issue and rest of other features is good
10920,4.0,looks wise gud product camera battery are ok
10921,5.0,for enjoying newness everyone worries when faced new circumstances like anxiety before an interview or nervousness before doing things for the very fist time so to conquer the worry and enjoy the fun in new read this book
10922,2.0,the material was thin showed every lump youd rather hide and clung to the body even the sleeves were tight looked inexpensive
10923,2.0,needs ability to increase the volume for those that are hearing impaired
10924,5.0,love this poncho purchased xs in goldolive color and the length is good i could have sized up for extra length but thought there was too much fabric in body for reference slender love the diagonal cable pattern and curved design the sleeves are more comfortable for me pushed up a little but if left long works well and are about wrist length the color is great for fall but could easily transition into winterspring the gray is a lighter gray and is nice too but size xs not availab
10925,2.0,i bought this dress for a holiday party and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo i still liked it but when i went to try it on it was just not working i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted i would recommend sizing up but be aware that the top straps shoulder to breast are too loose to begin with so they may sag overall i wouldnt recommend this dress for the curren
10926,1.0,its not original copy
10927,1.0,heating issue battery back up is not good rear camera is okay as per the mobile price
10928,2.0,i usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit pretty but returning
10929,4.0,good quantity sound but less battery life
10930,1.0,i tried this dress on in the store i loved the fabric and color but the fit was huge no matter how much i sized down there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose but this was shapeless in an unflattering way i was attracted to the style and color but the execution left much to be desired
10931,4.0,everything is fine except this phone automatically restart while in use and sometimes gets switched off automatically and no matter how much you try to turn it on its will not show you a single thing on screen and sometimes the music sounds also get too low you cannot hear a single word even in full volumesamsung please solve this issue or let me know whats is problem
10932,3.0,got it for mom its okay for basic use only nothing great about this phone
10933,2.0,no issues with camera battery and display totally happy with those but the processor is slow af the phone is getting slower each day to a point where it takes around sec to receive a call you cannot play pubg properly its playable under low graphics that too provides low fps fingerprint reader got very slow now i dont even remember that there is a option of face unlock earlier it was working fine but now it takes more than sec to unlock dont buy it guys i am trying to exchange with some other phone but amazon has not added this phone in their exchange phones list
10934,2.0,received as a gift worked wonderfully for months just stopped working would like to replace it but do not want to have to keep reinvesting if the product will not last for even a full year disappointed
10935,4.0,i like it for the most part the only thing that i dont like is that theres no way to have alexa help you to remember what apps you enabled on the deviceand its very easy to forget unless you use the app consistentlyalso it sometimes activates from something it picks up from the television
10936,1.0,got the defective phonecharging not staying for more than hrs there is no replacement option too waste of buying this product even customer service is not so much helpful on this product buying of k mobile i have to get in touch with all the others and have to get it certified that mobile is defective
10937,4.0,these run tiny i wear a in pants and took a medium in this bottom and im still not completely comfortable with the fit love the floral print but with a bottom this small you dont really see much of the flowers so on mine at least its just some splashes of different dark colors
10938,3.0,ive been searching for a pretty and unique party top and thought this was it it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and im only sadly i had to return maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger

10964,3.0,works good as an echo however i bought this for a second home and amazon could not tell me how to sync this with my insteon system there since i had already synced to an insteon system with my echo at my first homedisappointed as this is one of the primary reasons i purchased it

10974,4.0,for this color i was waited for a week and finaly i got that good product and the new digital
10975,2.0,this conditioner just did not work for me at all i have b curls below shoulder length very thick coarse wiry hair there just wasnt enough moisturization and there was almost no curl definition it left my hair feeling soft but thats only because it was a big floofy frizzy cloud of fuzz thats not surprising since dimethicone is the third ingredient coconut oil fifth and lemon oil and orange extract are seventh and eighth i dont even get why citrus extracts would be included in a quotmoisturizingquot conditioner since those strip your hair ive seen a lot of mixed reviews of organix products i think ill leave this line alone
10976,1.0,pickup id
10977,2.0,i ordered this in a l online and wasnt a fan when i received it the colors are pretty bright but they also look cheap in my opinion it also had an awkward fit because of the material there is no give at all it was really tight on my chest d for reference and it was also pretty short and im short it barely hit the top of my pantsand im back it went
10978,2.0,nice quality fabric and design but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
10979,2.0,i am really disappointed with camera quality camera quality is like very basic model and its fake brightness better buy redmi phone instead of this phone comment for developers of this phone some times video start failed you will get video failed message you need to restart the device to get rid of the error message overall its below average and just created hype i want to know who gave this as no mobile
10980,2.0,i m samsung lover since long i purchased ms in first sale after using days its performance is very bad as it is hanging again and again with normal use also i am not able to play even angry bird as it hangs after some time what does it mean of so many features if your newly purchased phone hangs and you feel like cheated i was not expecting this type of performance from samsung i didnt like it otherwise all features are very good and battery is superb
10981,5.0,i just love this speaker it adds base to my playlist the songs sound much better i just cant connect it to my laptop otherwise everything is perfect
10982,2.0,review title says almost all add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young just too cute for words i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart this however on an older woman looks ridiculous i would have liked it for those months but even then it would cover quadruplets
10983,4.0,its a really good product happy with it
10984,1.0,it will charge mah battery times only and company assured its mahhow could possible i returned it

10988,4.0,wide screen and picture quality is fine sound quality is average easy to connect with all apps
10989,3.0,i waited impatiently for this item to come in stock and when it did i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it its hit or miss with me as far as retailers mediums and larges depending on the brand i generally err on the side of caution so i ordered the large it looked cute out of the package but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed it flared way out at the bottom and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model this could have been the large sizing but
10990,4.0,not for heavy uses
10991,4.0,i ordered this dress to wear for summer weddings this year i am both surprised and excited that it fits i normally wear an sometimes a stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths but not to actually shop i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl this happens sometimes a brand only makes clothing up to a so theyre xl is really a but not so i feel like the xl could fit a the l would probably fit a as well this dress fits in
10992,1.0,all the hype around this phone is not warranted the phone is way too big for handling and is not good the one handed handling is clumsy the battery takes forever to charge and the quick charger is not a quick charger the batter does not last long and even the minimal functioning of the phone needs a lot of power the phone is very heavy and does not fit into your pocket unless you are a giant here is the fun part the screen is totally unprotected and will break even if you drop it casually yes mine broke
10993,5.0,i was using this phone for last days i give for this product
10994,3.0,being somewhat skeptical as to how much this would be used when it went on sale i had to try it before going any further these are only my results and yours may certainly vary hoping that it will work better for you than me thats for sure heres the experience so farthe goodskills are awesomelots of games and fun things to fool around withcontrolling lights and devices works percent of the timeeasy to set upnews flash is a great way to start the daythe badmusic streaming is just not happening unreliable a lot of buffering usually can get a song or two out of it then its just not therethe prime music selection is pretty good without the premium but percent of what i want to listen to needs the premiumnavigating products to purchase can be painful unless youre exactly sure of what you wantbluetooth connection can be hit and miss sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt and sometimes it just wont reconnect to a paired devicestill hoping for the magic software update that will address these issues despite the experience i do still use it a lot for light control and news every morning so i give it a realistic stars its okay wishing it was a lot better and overall the good slightly outweighs the badvoice recognition is really good
10995,2.0,this top was just not flattering im and medium build and the m was very bulky and the fabric didnt fall in the right places made me look very round and im not so its definitely going back
10996,1.0,use less ph very slow totally waste of money

11000,1.0,i had such high hopes for this top the colors the peplum the ruffles the price point the fit was terrible unflattering and laughable please try again with this one retailer you could have a real winner with a little tweaking

11002,2.0,the book had the first pages missing not expected from a book house of this stature
11003,2.0,sigh i love the organix hair product lines every one except this one as usual i looked over reviews before i purchased it because of the price to product ratio and decided to go for it unfortunately this was a bad move as my hair is now dry frizzy limp and notty it is quite painful actually and i have lost a lot of hair because of this one the moment i use other organix products my hair goes back to normal with no side effects i am not entirely sure why this certain shampoo did not meet my hairs standards because of the cost i am too stubborn to throw it out so will stick with it until it is used up maybe mixing a few poos will help
11004,5.0,i originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it so i bought a second one in the neutral color they both fit perfectly and are very flattering i love how i can dress them up or down i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy i also wear them to work i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days when im used to wearing scrubs i hate wearing true dress clothes these dresses are a happy medium i only wish my size was available in the t

11012,3.0,i tried yellow motif but unfortunately i did not purchase it it was quite difficult to explain why it did not work for me i liked its floral pattern and shape of sleeves texture was ok usually i like a cool touch of linen but this tshirt was not as comfortable as the other products made of linen i was not quite sure it just was not right for me only word i could think was average personally i do not recommend it but who knows maybe it is right for you so try wear
11013,2.0,i so wanted to love this sweatshirt it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material the pattern is pretty and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it unfortunately the body of the sweatshirt particularly the front torso area was too big and it popped out around me like a balloon the arms fit well so i dont think that i could have gone down a size i was also not keen on the way the neck hung which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded

11022,3.0,its just ok the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away i love it and i just didnt my husband looked and said it is just a blah color on me so that maybe part of it the fabric is nice doesnt seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace i am and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o
11023,4.0,sd card is missing not include the kit
11024,3.0,this dress is adorable it simply did not fi off the rack i invested dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets why where they even there and to shape the bottom basically the dress is straight all the way down the sidesby up and alter the top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me the quality of the fabric is excellent and the pattern is adorable can be worn as little black dress cocktail party or date night the top de
11025,3.0,while the dress is pretty its a lot more boring than it seems online the box top is actually a completely separate piece which is kind of neat you can choose to remove it or not the box top is very wide much wider than on the model and very unflattering also the dress is a stiff silk fabric and doesnt flow like you would think it would returning it
11026,3.0,battery could be better there is no extra memory slot you can use the slot either for second sim or for memory cardcamera is ok
11027,2.0,i tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine whimsical top so i ordered a small online but even then a small is still too big and i usually wear a medium or an in tops maybe if it was slimmer through the ribswaist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternityish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust the front was too short as well stopped higher than what is shown on the model and im assuming sh
11028,4.0,the dot does not sound as robust as the echo but handles the same functions on a par with it it certainly takes up less space and is very unobtrusive
11029,2.0,i love this top so cute and comfy but i wore it twice washed it once on gentle and layed to drynow there are small holes in the front for as much as it cost i would have expected it to be more durable very disappointing especially since i dont live near an retailer and cant take it back easily
11030,4.0,mi a is my first mi mobile and is delighted with its performancecamera qualitydisplay the daylight photos are good and night shots are also good with details as expectedthis mobile is worth each penny
11031,1.0,poor quality material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured
11032,1.0,no reviews because open box delivered to me and headphone missing so no review
11033,5.0,superb just buy it
11034,1.0,the tank looks nothing like the one pictured mainly because its tissuepaper thin also i ordered it in two sizes xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large the armholes hit halfway to my waist obviously i didnt even bother opening the size s both will be returned
11035,5.0,this skirt is great and you cant beat it for the price it fits more like a pencil skirt on me and looks sort of aline on the model very nice work appropriate skirt though the slit comes higher than i expected my thighs are tattooed so i put on some black tights and it looks great with a blouse and cardigan
11036,3.0,product is good but some features are missing like no option for changing of wallpaper delivery was quick from amazon
11037,4.0,after using the phone for few months now i will give it stars pro good battery life for normal user okayish charging speed great looks ui looks cool too wide angle camera photos are awesome even selfies and normal photos are good low light photography suffers a bit face unlock feature is very fast and accurate too cons fingerprint sensor is too slow samsungs os features like searching lags a bit flash light is not so powerful and hence low light photographs are not good all and all good stylish phone mi phones might be better than it in this range but for those who dont like to go for those companies like me this is a decent enough phone you can get value for money
11038,4.0,it has been a helpfull tool

11041,2.0,i thought the photo of these pants was so cute when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were i held the waist up to my chest just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground i am not a short woman i ordered a i am i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size
11042,2.0,i tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger but its basically cut for modelsized people only its short and wide and if you have any boobs at all itll make the back pucker i cant imagine this will look good on most women

11044,5.0,i like this i have dry damaged hair and this helps it and it smells good and i get the bonus size so not bad price i wouldnt use it every time i wash my hair though as i have a feeling i still need more moisture but its a nice conditioner for using on occasion

11051,4.0,i loved everything about this dress except the length that fabric is great the width of the dress was greatnot too slim but not too baggy but the front side length was the problem it is longer in the back which was great i could have even dealt with the front length but for my age the way the sides came up fairly high just couldnt work for me i you are younger and okay with showing lots of leg go for it its really cute

11070,3.0,works well as described and have some heat issue
11071,4.0,the mi a doesnt look like its predecessors and thats a good thing its a bit of a stretch to access the notification panel when using the phone onehanded but other than that its a great size even though getting an amoled panel the p resolution is just not good enough for a device in this segment there is a camera bump at the back with the sensor protruding slightly from the body that leads to a wobble when using the device on a flat surface which tends to get annoying the indisplay fingerprint reader is slow unreliable and just not worth the effort when you consider the lowresolution screen large battery and modern soc its not difficult to see why the mi a offers good battery life i easily got a full day of usage with this phone using it mostly for browsing social media and watching youtube videos the mi a does a fantastic job in daylight conditions with excellent contrast levels wide dynamic range and accurate colors the wideangle lens doesnt do as good a job but the resultant images are decent enough for sharing on social media platforms photos taken in lowlight conditions arent detailed enough and theres a lot of noise and using the dedicated night mode fixes the issue to an extent the camera overall is pretty decent considering how much the mi a costs the best part about the mi a is undoubtedly the software like every other android one device the mi a has a clean user interface with no bloat ware positives android one goodness premium design decent camera fantastic battery life mm jack is back negatives the indisplay fingerprint sensor is terrible lowresolution display the mi a is a decent showing if youre looking for a budget android one device but there are plenty of other phones in the market at around the same price point that come with more features added some latest photos clicked after days of use from mi a

11107,3.0,the material of the dress is gorgeous but the armholes droop much too low under the arms in addition i am fairly broad shouldered and the cut across the chest is too narrow exposing your chicken wings in an unflattering way this is gorgeous on the model so i would say narrow shouldered girls should order a size down and give it a shot
11108,3.0,i ordered the pink and it was gorgeous the color and feel were so soft i would have kept it if it were a blanket but i did send it back because as a sweater it just didnt lay right it has a sort of inside layer that just didnt fit right with the outside sweater layer so it ended up puffing up on the sides at the waist that was not flattering and the hood was too large and floppy looking too bad

11110,5.0,i fell in love with this top when i first saw it in the store and bought it during the off sale im petite dd usually a size i tried the xs and s and while both fit i like the roominess of the s so i got that size i bought the regular size for a little extra length but could have worn the petite its great for layering because of all the bright colors and although the front is polyester the back is knit so its nice and cool i personally love loosefitting shorter tops so i

11115,2.0,i really wanted to love this dress i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors and thought that the green color would be perfect it is well made but the fabric is lighter than expected the biggest issues was the size i am and typically a size ten i ordered the ten and it fit like a it was huge if you order this i would say size down two sizes
11116,2.0,when the echo functions properly it is a wonderful device however if you have problems with it such as the calendar event times being five hours later than the events on your apple icalendar you will rapidly see the problem with this product the technical support is simply horrible you will be forced to speak with a rep whose command of the english language may or may not be adequate you will have to spend literally hours on the phone doing the same actions over and over you will be promised that your issue will be fixed mine hasnt yet after three calls and over three hours on the phone you will receive emails telling you that you need to contact customer support again you will be once again asked to do the same things you did last time you spoke with a rep you will once again be promised upper level support will fix the issue the whole support system is terribly frustrating and as far as i can tell broken

11126,4.0,i should preface this by saying that im in between sizes i chose the smaller size and found that this top is not super forgiving im keeping it bc it is good quality and i like the style but i wouldnt be comfortable wearing it right now maybe after i lose a few pounds

11137,2.0,really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out when it arrived it was heavy bulky in the package which didnt bode well taking it out of the bag i was surprised at how heavy thick it was the picture really looks like it would be a flowy grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day but in the reality you might drown in sweat the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate

11143,3.0,bought this on a whim i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online ordered it in black it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist lineit leaves a love handle lump without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool however i am on the fence on this one for the money there are better maxis out there

11152,4.0,comparing to chinese handsets the sar value is very low and according to the price this phone is the best in its segment although the chinese company are offering more battery ram and internal storage the performance of samsung and display are very good a suggestion for samsung is that they also should provide more facilities like chinese companies to take over them at the same price if you compare it with radmi the specification are far more superior than samsung ms at the same price but as a indian i wont buy chinese goods
11153,1.0,i bought this card originally for my galaxy note ii with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader but i could not get it to format correctly for the phone even using third party format softwarei then tried it in my galaxy tab plussame problemsi finally and ridiculously put the card in my nikon d camera i could take a whopping k photos on highlarge settings not that i would ever need to take that many photos in one session this was the last option i had to use the cardit worked well taking photos of a holiday and thankfully it did not fail before i could get my photos onto a computer since then i have inserted it back in the camera and reformatted like you always should and bam one photo is good after that failure every single time so now i have a gb card that is capable of taking and storing one photo at a time before i must run a fix file system on my computerdont waste your money on this card over priced not really faster than the other cards i have and zero longevity this may be a one off but i think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exfat that makes this card a loser or more to the point the poor customer who buys itupdate july after contacting sandisk they have offered an rma but first they must verify that i have not tried to recover or wipe the data on the card and i must ship it at my expense to taiwan i have since emailed them in reply to the requested information date of purchase photos of the card packaging ect and i told them that the data on their is my data and if i could have accessed the card i would have wiped it why should i give them my information stored on the card that makes me less than happy i am guessing that they want to discourage returns who would want to send data to a company not knowing who will access it and what they will do with the information contained i would have wiped the card but it was unreadable unable to format unable to do anything i will send it to them hoping that the information is destroyed along with the bad cardsandisk you are asking a whole lot of your customers and since this card has gone bad i have had several other cards from them go bad as well seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods i used to love their products and their older flash drives are great still using a micro cruzer that is years old and going strong i have not had one single microsd card from this company last more than three months since i moved to the philippines either they send their junk to the philippines or they have dropped qc from their business model to create higher profit marginsupdate after emailing sandisk and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item intact so that they can assess the card and look atrecover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card they rescinded i can only assume that they want to get the card back to verify that it is bad or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them which i can understand instead of requiring me to send the card back to them they asked that i cut the card and send a photo of the destroyed card so they could process a new card to be sent to me directly in the philippines i hammered them pretty hard in this review and in the email i sent to them regarding the bad card and sometimes you get results in this case i give them stars for doing the right thing i had no problem cutting the card since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway but i did have a problem returning the device intact with out knowing what information was stored on the card banking amazon account info passwords ect i would have just kept the card destroyed it and never bought another from sandisk with their faith restoring gesture i will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid i just hope that they get better at qc i returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday only to find out that you must have the original packaging for a replacement i was lucky to still have one of my packages but since i bought several of the cards i am not sure if i gave them the matching package for the card i returnedi would suggest that if you are like me and have several devices dslrs galaxy tab galaxy note sii lgp that you find a way to mark each cardpackage and keep the package in the case that the card should go bad i have had more than half of my sandisk gb cards fail on me in less than months i only buy them because of the cards available in my area these are the best which is scary with such a high failure rate
11154,2.0,although there is nothhing wrong with the speaker and everything seems to be be working fine i gave it stars because of the sound quality sound quality is the most important when it comes to speakers to me this speaker is not loud at all after turning the volume up all the way it still did not produce half of the sound quality my lg bluetooth speaker does it would be beneficial in a small room but do not think this speaker is going to be adequate for your jam sessions you will be sadly dissappinted as i am the features with the voice commands are a plus though although google does the same on my other bluetooth i should have investigated it more before purchasing

11159,3.0,i remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it so i traveled to the store to try it on the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat so i tried on the small the didnt quite button over my bust and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body no problem medium it is
11160,3.0,it gets heated

11169,2.0,this piece didnt make sense to me maybe its bc im a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer i didnt think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear it went back
11170,2.0,i had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself i was very excited to get it as it is a beautiful coat online however once i received it i was very disappointed the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well perso
11171,3.0,the dress is great for pear shapes however i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing ordered a small and i still think it may be a bit big the material is very comfortable not too thick or thin however i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric see the attached photo
11172,2.0,i loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets however the material was quite thin and the quality was not great there were multiple snags along the seams additionally at lbs i was swimming in the size i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better

11176,4.0,i just bought two of these for our two new samsung galaxy iv smart phones the adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these microsd cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the usb dongle to move information on and off the phones but most importantly now i dont worry about storing audio books favorite playlists and video clips i might want to show someone on the phones
11177,2.0,i am now awaiting a replacement from sandisk because it failed after the amazon return period always had good luck with sandisk cards until now phone and pc simply stopped seeing the card lost all of my data which i fortunately had backed up elsewhere

11181,3.0,without seeing the online exclusive notation i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they dont carry it in stores i ordered it at the checkout desk in a size medium i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray this sweater was right up my alley i was very disappointed when i decided to return it first of all i d
11182,2.0,the neck is so big on this sweater i couldnt make it lay right the shape of the sweater is odd it is really wide on the upper torso but tapers near your waist it did not look as depicted on the model the sweater is a lovely color i liked the twotone but overall the fit was too weird for me material is soft and it felt really nice on but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck
11183,1.0,its really worst product after working fine one day its heating too much and stop working and amazon is also not providing to replace or return option it has written to replace in days but they are not replacing amazon has complicated the replacement and return process to replace it connect to amazon and wait for whole day to talk with customers agent and end of day you will get sorry there are heavy call please wait wait wait
11184,5.0,bought the pink color in the store and just loved the way that they fit me i ended up ordering the light blue perfect for a cool summer evening can be worn with sandals wedges or converse sneakers
11185,1.0,havent used it much its already messing up will not play music when asked
11186,5.0,go monster as the name says its battery life is just amazing with a medium heavy usage it lasted me hours on a single charge from to its camera is megapixel primary so the quality is great even when you fully zoom into the photo the build looks solid simple design and a stunning samoled display is sure to immerse you into the experience
11187,1.0,it takes more than hrs for getting full charge and anathor problem is this power bank have the capacity mah my phone battery have only mah that means i can charge my phone by times but i couldnt charge my phone times only maximum times i can charge so tottaly i am disappointed by this product

11192,3.0,very cute adorable shape tank top but extremely huge does not come in petite and is not even close to fitting me extra small is like a medium not a sky color like the picture it is a blackandwhite type of the shirt which needs a thin camisole underneath shirt is definitely white but would look great with the black or gray camisole underneath better for taller larger sized people
11193,2.0,highly dissatisfied with the technician who came for installation zero knowledge of the features crass language be aware you cannot opt for return refund of the product misleading info by theselleramazon you can only return exchange a trap that the companyamazon is trying to pull you in
11194,4.0,i tried the xs in store white though it is sold out online guess i was lucky the top is pretty sheer i could wear it with nothing underneath like on of the sales people did however you can see my innie like a big shadow i like the look it is a little boxy but feminine at the same time mine fits wide like the model why i put as true to size if there were still some xxs i might have ordered it it is a bit edgy not romantic as some other pieces i have overall i like the
11195,2.0,its slow and always hangover not happy
11196,4.0,it was fun to read it gave me a idea about what the hard reality is i have started to apply things into action
11197,2.0,i have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun i really wanted to like it but i could not there were spots missing sequence some fell off as i tried the dress on and i did try it on twice each time there were some on the floor they are sewed on so poorly for the price of this dress i fear it would be a dress for one season and id have to throw it out not for that price so back it goes
11198,5.0,name brand great price great shipping
11199,5.0,didnt think we needed this until we actually got it we use it everyday surprisingly my year old also loves it tons of kid songs to listen to as well cuts down on screen time wish i got he bigger one
11200,1.0,worst product one side stopped within months no service by boat no one responding
11201,1.0,it has severe signal issues specially in areas where signal strength is weak i used same sim in asus zen phone max pro and it was constantly showing better signal and giving good internet speedhowever mi a has disappointing signal receiving capacity and poor internet speed despite boasting better hardware configuration another big concern is over projected camera within month my camera glass is broken and it is not covered in warranty it is very impractical design to keep camera glass projected outside phones body which makes it prone to damage i used mi a nokia and asus max pro m and found asus max pro m as best allrounder phone in terms of performance and practical design and rightly priced
11202,5.0,worth for budget
11203,2.0,base is not good
11204,3.0,so i havent actually tried this and im sorry for the misleading star rating i just wanted to get someones attention on the length the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video the dress is about inches off the floor is it the model in the video that is extra tall someone help me out this looks gorgeous but since its an online exclusive i wont be able to try it on at the store
11205,5.0,i am short waisted and generally a petite on the top so a lot of these sweater vest toppers i find to be too long in the torso for me this one however is the perfect exception it is soft but with some structure comfortable and not too hot for warmer weather climates during the spring i bought it in seattle though i live in dallas and found it to be a perfect layering piece with a white tshirt and a jean jacket while walking around the rainy city fyi short waist broad
11206,5.0,tried on a size regular and it fit well felt incredibly soft and airy and is handwashable im currently or with narrow shoulders and torso somewhat longwaisted but petite from bust to shoulders i often wear a size p or in retailer dresses and tops the arm holes were a tiny bit low but not terrible a petite would have been shorter but also more of an empire waist the pink really is more of a red like the online photo great color
11207,1.0,i felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way the waistband is very fitted but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips its also see through fit is tts
11208,1.0,not working properly after month usage
11209,4.0,good product compared to other its little bit heavy
11210,4.0,sometimes it do hung even though having gb ram variant not good preforamce speed rest all is good good camera good screen quality good touch feel okok battery back fine quick charging but not worth of
11211,5.0,i have been using for month till now its good i bought at
11212,5.0,this honest review is in comparison to the value vs money of this phone the performance of the phone is awesome though in various reviews i came to know that the processor will be slow than snapdragon processors i feel no difference for my day to day usage from the earlier snapdragon models i have used the finger print sensor is real fast in recognizing the face unlock is quick and really helpful the camera quality is amazing and more than worth than what we pay for this phone you can see the attached photos which are amazing according to me no issues regarding catching the network signals coming to the battery its lasting around one and half day minimum for my usage which is quite great i am not carrying my heavy power bank now which i used to do earlier though the built is not metallic it is not a problem for me as a strong case i have purchased which keeps my mobile very safe even if metallic built we still use hard cases and therefore the weight will be more which is not the case here the size of mobile is also fine as i can easily keep in pant pocket which earlier i thought it would be a problem the sound quality is decent and more than sufficient the sound when using my jbl earphones is amazing as the dolby effect is given only issue i have is the back of mobile gets vibrated at the time of ringing when calling someone which looks little odd for me the device care option is good and need only install separate apps for that purpose the black light in night mode option is really helpful for me when using mobile in night and the blue tooth filter option is also good my eyes dont get strained too easily now as earlier it used to be the notification light is not great adsense as the option of always on display is provided the ram function is good and mobile is able to handle multiple applications easily i am not a regular gamer but i have played asphalt for couple of hours and the mobile did not heat up while playing it the security updates are done once and asked for quick scan which was good reminder another factor to buy this mobile is its low sar value compared to other phones in this range you can definitely go for this mobile than the other mobiles since its good in every aspect overall i would say that this mobile is more than value for money and is a great buy
11213,3.0,i loved the features of this watch wouldve given rating but i was delivered a watch with gps non functional this was disappointing considering i cycle and run and gps is pretty basic finally had to take it to service center and they replaced the motherboard due to warranty i got it changed free of cost but still considering the price and the brand this is not expected battery lasts for under days without bluetooth connectivity howet its loaded with features and the screen is beautifulmakes it looks like an actual watch for a bit of a distance also love the different watch faces the distance and speed tracking and steps are pretty accurate overall its pretty neat id recommend if u r a samsung brand fan
11214,4.0,good quality and the charging due tp this is fast enough rather than my original one

11225,2.0,i received this dress in the mail yesterday right away i noticed the coloring wasnt quite the same as it appears in the images online in person the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny as opposed to more muted i was willing to look past that but then i tried it on i ordered a small which is my typical size in retailer dresses it ran quite large and was way to long for me i am overall between the coloring and sizing this dress wasnt a hit for me
11226,1.0,one cant tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent it also is very long almost dress length feels less quality than what retailer usually carries
11227,3.0,i ordered these hoping they would look like the model but they didnt i am small but curvy it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly these pants are going back
11228,1.0,this is my first phone from apple i was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments i went for iphone due to craziness the product is well packed and delivered when i started using the phone the screen looks average battery is good and the hardware seems good the camera disappoints me al lot never expect this from apple in particular the front camera is worst in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a vga camera at a cost of k i was more so curious about the camera it disappoints me badly even my motorola camera works well if you are crazzy for the brand go for it else definitely you can go for other models in the market
11229,2.0,i bought it on amazon sale but i still feel its overpriced and doesnt offer any significant features over the iphone all the extra money for gb ram is not worth could have bought a much better phone for that price
11230,1.0,i am not able to return the product i want to return it and buy another phone i do not like this mobile but they do not allow me to return as there is no technical issue this is very ridiculous behaviour
11231,4.0,value for money this is just entry level phone better option for minimum use of mobile you can run whatsapp
11232,1.0,hangs a lot dont buy this cheapo phone instead invest some healthy amount on higher spec phones for the extreme satisfaction of everyday use otherwise use nokia
11233,5.0,a fun casual romper i loved the pink color not usually my thing which looks great with darker skin like another reviewer said the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes i took a size in this but am usually a this will make the top part a bit blousy but i think that adds to the appeal look
11234,3.0,i love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work im an athletic person with more of a pear shape so alines really work for me i got my usual size in this dress and while i felt like the waist was true to size the top gapped so badly im a b that i had to return the dress a tailor probably could have done something to it but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense too bad because the fabric is a lovely weight the length was per
11235,4.0,im and lbs i usually have a hard time finding pants or leggings that are short enough and fit just right i ordered an xs and these fit like a glove right away and i was so pleased i ordered the brown and blue motif i have only received the blue so far but love them they hit just right at the ankle and arent too loose at the bottom it seems like they are made well but will wait until after the first wash im someone that wears leggings all the time but love that these look like
11236,5.0,superb product at good price i used samsung bluetooth after that was searching for the good replacement then got this one at good price of k in offer awsome sound quality overall
11237,1.0,i bought this on august and as of september the unit has stopped charging it does not take in any charge and so cannot charge any of my devices the return window is too short and closed on september i am very disappointed with this product update as on oct three weeks ago i made the effort to go to the mi service center who replaced the unit as it had stopped charging itself today the replaced unit has also stopped charging itself and now i will have to go through the whole ordeal all over again i have never dropped either of the power banks nor have i misused them in any way they were both always kept and handled carefully despite this the power banks have failed not once but twice please do not buy this powerbank it is extremely bad quality and it will fail you it is useless at its price and it will cause you much stress and effort when you most need it i am extremely disappointed with this mi powerbank please learn from my experience and do not buy this
11238,2.0,the product does not get as loud as i would have hoped i also was unaware that the device will have to be plugged up at all times to operate i do like how it can connect to my phone i appreciate alexa but i would not recommend this product for me the echo black is more worth it
11239,5.0,bought this skirt in the light plum color nice soft corduroy fabric it fit well not too short will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots my only complaint i wish it had pockets
11240,3.0,i bought it during the discount session at and at that price its really good the audio is clear and crisp only thing i dont like is the bass it was somehow a hidden miss but there they are and you can use third party music players to control it bus as of right now at pirce of i think its just a little pricy

11265,4.0,im curvy on the bottom and i think this is quite flattering for curves id definitely advise sizing up on this one because its flared i can wear it higher up on my waist but thats not ideal and i think a bigger size will fit better its a very lightweight fabric and does wrinkle easily the color i got was a faded denim blue this is a lot lighter than what id call dark denim
11266,2.0,until i figure out how to add my apple music to the dot i give this a star
11267,5.0,best product in this range and quality

11271,5.0,im surprised at how much i use it i have only had it a couple days and i already find it indispensable for my busy schedule i just ordered another one for the living room i believe devices like this will be ubiquitous in the near future the addition of ifttt has expanded the usefulness of alexa exponentially
11272,4.0,its a super fast processoreasy to handle good cameras only problem is with the weight

11276,5.0,i am lbs d and the petite fit tts the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip my dress arrived with a nude slip i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing the lace actually stands out all in all a greal buy discounts make it worth it too
11277,1.0,the dress is pretty i ordered a and not knowing how it ran i took both back the neck is too tight

11286,2.0,handset look like premium but display is disappointed to me with resolution is p display size not full screen always mini size showing so i am disappointed with resolution pixels so i am satisfy with this mobile handset
11287,2.0,this arrived this week and i was so disappointed the proportions are all wrong from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves to the weird texture added to the material if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be weird
11288,1.0,i had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth and he was right im usually a size so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso but probably not way too much fabric around the midsection its a shame because the fabric was really pretty but too stiff a hand to drape well
11289,4.0,very very good n essential book but some mistakes are there
11290,4.0,i was looking for a new springsummer tee that still gave coverage for chillier mornings and nights and this is it it has a nice swing to it that isnt too wide think a flattering aline cut that has some movement towards the bottom hem it is fitted and flattering where it needs to be the shoulders and ribcage run fitted and tts which means you dont get lost in the top its not boxy or oversized but if you want a fitted and more flattering look you can definitely size down easily parti

11298,1.0,got deffective product remote is not working tv doesnt detect fire stick not expected form amazon
11299,2.0,ill start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful the top is sheer but thats pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso not the chest but the midsection is cut fairly wide im b and usually wear a or a smallmedium depending on how relaxed i want the fit i purchased this in a the arms were workable but slightly fitted and the torso fit like an chest was as expect
11300,3.0,good to buy

11307,2.0,it is very bad to know that the camera quality is not at all good even with mpa now im feeling waste of money i thought samsung brand is reliable but i feel they are fooling the customer i have ordered redmi note pro at the same time but cancelled later thinking that samsung will be a brand one and reliable if i have the option to refund me i will opt for it immediately
11308,3.0,this dress didnt work for me for several reasons but i knew i wouldnt keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress dress updress down into super casual only plus it looks cheap it is also not for the long waisted or tall on the plus side the fabric feels great and it hangs well
11309,4.0,the product was delivered on time the display is amazing and touch is as smooth as butter i used a j before and the screen doesnt appears to be too big it fits right in the pocket only thing that i was disappointed is that there is no earphone included in the package which i feel a basic thing that must be included along with phone overall its worth every paisa go for it

11318,4.0,i love this dress so very much i wish i could keep it but it doesnt look right on me i am lbs b waist hip dress fit me well except for the fact that it made me look very wide i think the combination of the ruffles on the sleeves with the blouseyness and my short stature was not a great combo it will be amazing on tall slender women but did not flatter my short frame otherwise beautiful

11340,4.0,one of the more beautiful pieces retailer hags carried in a long time i instantly fell in love the second i took it out of the box the only problem is that it runs short in the torso i ordered the xs and it fit perfectly everywhere except it gave me a wedgie for reference i am lbs and a b i returned the jumpsuit and ordered it in a small hopefully its long enough everything about it is true to size except torso length i have an average torso so someone with a large torso m

11343,3.0,runs a little small in the shouldersbust
11344,5.0,after reading the reviews about this top being really clingy i decided to order up a size and purchased a medium when i took it out of the box today and held it up it looked huge and i thought i had made a mistake however when i tried it on it actually fit really well i could see if i had ordered my usual small how it would have clinged to my body in a unflattering way very happy with the top and thankful for the reviews

11346,1.0,sim slot is not open easily fingerprint reader is reading anyones finger and mobile lock is open anyones fingers touch
11347,2.0,i am normally between a size and so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work the seemed pretty tight all around so i returned the and kept the even though there was a little bit of room in the waist of course the size after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out was bagging in the crotch area sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
11348,4.0,i wasnt too keen on buying this but it works fine with relaxed hair if you like using natural products this isnt for you its not water based however i love using this after i finish washing my hair on occasions ill use this before i walk out the door just a tad and my hair has so much body from it
11349,4.0,good as expected
11350,2.0,this day review of the phone about the look and feel onlyi bought the opal black gb variant and was delivered yesterday to my surprise the marketing team has done a fantastic job in promotion but it is in sharp contrast to the manufacturing pros fast charger i got it for which is suitable for this kind of phone cons the phone is very heavy and bulky there is no basic phone cover available inbox back side is prone to finger prints and scratches so you go and buy a cover first the screen is marketed as super amoled however it is hd at best if you compare with as super amoled screen ms stands nowhere so false marketing main camera is marked as mp however it is mp at best front camera also fails to impress added a new contact it took seconds for the name to appear on the contact number after being saved read another review which said the user observed less network towers on his ms when he was in full network coverage area as shown by other phones point is true i also observed the less network coverage with this phone overall this phone has failed to impress on almost every front overall it not as per the expectations i had based on the feature mentioned for the phone
11351,5.0,pocket friendly
11352,5.0,cute and super comfortableso its the best of both worlds it fits true to size but i bought a size up to add a little extra length love the soft blue color and ruffles
11353,3.0,i ordered this dress and have sent it back i think it could be a flattering dress the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly i am very long waisted so this might just be a problem for me i ordered regular size
11354,3.0,the fingerprint is worst performance in a deviseim not satisfied with this product and im going to be claim the another devise
11355,4.0,the fit and style of this dress are beautiful its a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable i really wanted to love it but the color just didnt work for me the pictures make it look like its a nice cream color but its very tan and i cant pull it off with my coloring
11356,4.0,fun to have
11357,1.0,i received a defective iphone the quality standards were not maintained its a shame that it has happened to an iphone
11358,1.0,the worst and worst piece especially the set is resetarting delicate piece
11360,5.0,it is a perfect thing there is nothing to dislike
11361,5.0,nice and sleek
11362,2.0,exes heating problem
11363,4.0,first of all this is a great phone at such price though samsung rarely reduces price for such specs so its like a giveaway who are hungry for more storage and speed and who dont prefer chinese phones pros samoled display has a super silky touch response sometimes you will feel you didnt even touched it gb actual storage is what you get in this which is more than other phones humongous battery but charge your phone to when you receive it at first for better performance comes with battery dual sim dual voltage is new feature which distinguish it from other phones earlier you has option for only gg other sim automatically switches to g but with this feature you can use all bandwith of gg and g for both sims eg if you have jio sim in one slot then other sim will have better network because it can now connect to all gg and g dedicated slot for sd though it will not be required super fast delivery cons camera doesnt click like its mega pixel photo quality is not that good front camera also not worth the bucks a little thicker from peers quite slippery in hand should use cautiously when not using without backcover no long screenshot option which comes in many phones now a days no earphones in box usable ram is lesser than expected
11364,4.0,battery backup really good camera is good charging not good sensors not working good looking
11365,5.0,ive been using this for maybe months now and really like it i have semicoarse straight asian hair that can get dried out on the ends about chin length w layers i use a dimesized amount probably a bit less rub between my hands then apply mostly to the ends whatevers left over gets lightly run through dampish hair and very gently patted on the top near my part to calm any flyaways i then let it airdry wo no problems or greasylook if i remember or feel like making an effort i run a brush through after it dries maybe sure itd probably help my hair look even more shiny and amazing if i used it before blowdrying but i hate blowdrying the best part of this stuff its a drugstore product so its affordable and it smells like kissing potionyou know that lip gloss that came in a rollerball applicator the only drawback the packaging wish it came in a dropper bottle or squeeze bottle or something similarly easy to control the top is just a hole w a flip cap so sometimes you get more than you want and it spills and spreads out the top also if it was packaged differently there wouldnt be a need for the extraneous box that it comes on id rather it be quotfreestandingquot and sealed or something
11366,4.0,today date i am receiving the product the manufacturing of product is august one year old product
11367,1.0,worst product no cooling from the installing day
11368,4.0,overall its great phone at this price but from the date of purchase i am facing some problems like call is automatically cut eg during the talk when other person is just going to pick the call even when ring is going on call is cut bluetooth problem
11369,5.0,while updating maps for my nuvi i received a message stating i needed more memory to download new versions of maps that i requiredthis was probably a bit of overkill but the price was right so i ordered one two days later i installed it and it worked flawlessly with mucho memory left for future needs will be buying a few more of them for other uses cant go wrong with this cardsee ya
11370,2.0,i really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view
11371,2.0,i wanted to love this dress and did from the picture online when it arrived the black already looked faded and old also the embroidery looks like a grandma but not in a cute vintage way the fabric is stiff which causes a boxy unflattering look had to return it
11372,2.0,dont speak hindi
11373,4.0,i fell for the charcoal one and bought standard size ml on first wearing with slim jeans booties and a long sleeved t the body of the vest was fine but with wavy shoulderlength hair i found the large wide collar overwhelming at the top i tried folding the collar under as in the photo of the gray one but still too much i altered it by paring it down by inches at the back neck and tapering down to meet the lapel at midchest the fabric looks like boiled wool but is actually a tigh
11374,5.0,this tshirt is great it fits really well and is very flattering the colors are nice including the tshirt color itself the fit is perfect including the sleeves and its very comfortable my only concern is how well it will do after you wash it a few times
11375,5.0,this is such a cute sweater i wouldnt really call it a poncho since it has standard sweater sleeves it has a wide circle hem which is very flattering i would have loved this even more if it were available in other colors besides white red black or navy would have been perfect
11376,3.0,when i bought this a year ago i had problems with it working properly in my sprint egt galaxy sii the card kept waking up the phone to be read over and over sandisk acknowledged this problem in some android devices and shipped me a new card once i returned this one to them the new card still had the same problem so i gave up the card is fast and i got a good deal on the price so i am pretty disappointed about it
11377,5.0,these are the best tights last year i bought these and they went back to regular waistband this year the best waistband tights are best
11378,1.0,i have always bought interesting pretty wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer now the dresses are just retro funky sad to see
11379,4.0,doesnt always pick up the wifi
11380,5.0,good product we can charge our mobile fully for times mah
11381,4.0,this product could be a gamechanger in our country especially since the trai regulations have forced many dth consumers like yours truly to shun the paid channel daylightrobbery however the firestick will not be able to compete with a stb if it continues to lack apps apart from the basic ones the technology on the other hand is a class apart for this price range it is a steal referring to prime day sale
11382,5.0,perfect
11383,3.0,i first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater the stitch is pretty but the fabric isnt nearly as soft as i expected it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater that said the fit is pretty flattering i didnt have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model ive been looking for this style of sweater so ill probably keep it however it really didnt meet my expectations for quality
11384,4.0,this skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers it runs very small im typically an or if i get a there is usually a bit of room in the item i decided to get a in this skirt just in case i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely
11385,4.0,pros battery displayfluidsmooth one uiram management processor performance storage speed is beyond the expectationit will easily beat any other company easily at this price segment yes i hv spend only k to buy this on amazon cons mp camera resolution is slightly much disappointing sound quantity of the speaker is louder but not too much good i expect software update can resolve this
11386,5.0,iphone has some unique features unlike other phones
11387,4.0,good phone in price value for money would recommend to everyone under k
11388,1.0,picture not qualitysound so goodthere is no return policy plss help me amazon
11389,5.0,i love the fit and the color i would buy this tshirt again in other patterns and colors the fabric is thin and lightweight but i knew that when i bought it apparently nothing this is a problem for some others i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it to preserve the fabric i hang dry after laundering the colors have not faded and the fabric is holding up well i am weigh lbs and do typically wear size medium
11390,5.0,as soon as i got the card i popped it into my phone and starting piling my music onto it but then i noticed kbs transfer speed i thought i got a class turns out the device the card is mounted in has a factor on write speed i plugged the card into the included sd card adapter and used a different reader and it was capping at mbs so im pretty happyone thing though you dont get gb of usable space with this card or any other card for that matter you get around gb with this card in particular its normal dont worry
11391,4.0,wow
11392,5.0,ive really been liking various ogx hair care products and this flexible beeswax texture hair spray wax is great imo i have a variety of quottexturequot sprays that contain wax and i do like them ag dry wax joico texture boost sexy hair play dirty ion texture spray wax and they all do a fine job but this ogx beeswax is just perfect and ill be purchasing this again its a wonderful finishing spray that gives hair a nice piecey look and definitely smooths flyaways and reduces or even eliminates frizz it gives my hair body and makes it more sleek and polished looking without appearing oily at all you definitely dont want to overspray and you do need to spray this lightly from at least inches away super easy and quick to use and does everything i need to maintain a nice polished piecey look my hair is shoulder length or just below shoulders and is a bit course can get frizzy when i blow dry it and this product just quotfixesquot everything
11393,3.0,i love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it but that would ruin the look of the dress just an inch or so higher would have been much better as much as i like the design and fit i will be returning this dress
11394,4.0,love the fit of this top love the design it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes dont go as small as i usually have to i got the smallest size and its pretty tight its a revealinglow cut top which is great for minimal tan lines negative threads are coming out all over after one wear but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart not so great considering the price though
11395,5.0,low budget but very good phone thanks amazon
11396,4.0,god
11397,3.0,i would recommend that one must buy a router instead of buying an adapter for lan cable which looks clumsy
11398,4.0,excellent sound quality looks loudness flaws battery drain very fast after few months of use poor quality wire connection
11399,2.0,i ordered this and hoped it would be a fun whimsical sweater for this winter instead its just strange it didnt fit well too short in the overall length in the sleeves the shades of the yarn were drab it also didnt seem made to last it looked like it would pillsnag in a short amount of time i returned it id love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future having a unique sleeve is a cute idea
11400,4.0,cheap and good in this price range u cannot get this good product really its good i thought it would be small but it was really good n spacious
11401,3.0,its ok but needs to be updated i think due to due it not having a lot of answer to basic questions one asks
11402,2.0,adorable foxes i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes dont come up very high so youre limited in the length you can wear i bought the ml based on salesperson advice and i cant imagine trying anything smaller i usually wear a size s or bottom these were super snug back to the store they went
11403,4.0,i had this conditioner and the shampoo in the back of my bathroom cabinet last time i had used it was when i still had very long hair it didnt do anything for me back then and it quietly found its place between all the other discarded shampoos amp conditioners yesterday i was watching essie buttons march favorites video and she mentioned this and as my hair is now only slightly longer than hers i thought i could give it a try again back when my hair was long i hated that it didnt moisturize enough and that it left my hair course but now with my lob it is perfect it makes my hair soft but not weighed down i actually can blow dry it and create volume without the use of an additional styling product this shampoo and conditioner have made it out of exile and have taken up residence in my shower
11404,5.0,very good mobile
11405,3.0,reviews said it ran small so i ordered a size up was large on me nicely made but wanted something a little smaller
11406,5.0,this sweater is really beautiful i love this brand and this piece is one of their best yet the fringe is perfect and flowy a sweater that you can team with jeans and boots and be the best dressed in the room tts soft with no itch really happy i bought it and because of the color and weight this is an all year sweater which i love because i know i will not want to pack it away it fits just like the photo
11407,2.0,what the hell the gb ram and ghz processor doing always take long time to load apps and internet very poor
11409,5.0,i had heard lot of negatives about exynos processor was skeptical while buying but lot of other features attracted me and moreover samsung a make in india product and to some extent being a nonchinese product added points to my selection i am a not a gamer but for my usage with lots of calls whatsapp maps and with gps running bluetooth connected all these has not drained the battery and no delays in app changeover inspite of lot of screens open in background so i rate it excellent this phone has little curvature at the ends adds on to its looks camera is excellent so its great
11410,5.0,i love this tee the fabric is very comfortable and the vneck is not too deep for petites
11411,5.0,awesome product from philips with all these features great sound excellent i liked so much thanks to amazon for one day earlier delivery
11412,3.0,needs to understand the marine tide tables when you ask for them you get the weather
11413,1.0,display quality is not up to the mark in this model of mi plus there were two accessions was missing back cover plus cable
11414,5.0,no doubt this is a very good product picture quality is good sound also nice i feel service was also good but the only thing i dont like is that it has no bluetooth connectivityalso the price decreased buy rs just after the day i made the payment
11415,4.0,i have bought it for around months it works good so far both read write speed meet the described specification
11416,5.0,superb camera superb battery and finger print in just sec premium phone by oneplus

11418,3.0,i love the look of this dress and the material the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear i dont think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work it is a shame because i really liked the look of it
11419,2.0,after using one the phone set totally blackout automattically no charging no switchon and not operating at all
11420,4.0,this is also good but not as my expectation
11421,2.0,bad
11422,1.0,im probably wasting my time writing yet another organix review but oh well ok so the first time i used this shampoo i had awesome results my hair was really soft and felt like i didnt even need to use conditioner which is rare for me regardless i went ahead and used the organix macadamia conditioner with itthey were out of the awapuhi conditioner i wanted anyway as soon as i rinsed the conditioner out my hair was like straw awful i mean i dont think ive ever had a drugstore product dry my hair out so badly not even suave has done this ive used the awapuhi shampoo a few times since with a different conditioner and i get mediocre results semidry hair not much shine just kind of blah i will not be repurchasing any organix shampoo or conditioners because i have never found one that works for me
11423,1.0,average one month use mother board not working
11424,1.0,after opening the box containing iphone s gb and putting it on charging the phone didnt get started switched on
11425,3.0,worth the money i spent and also additional features like fingerprint and face recognition to unlock amazing and would like to share few negative points like front camera clarity or quality of picture is not like earlier samsung phones i think you people copied oppo vivo which is giving very poor quality images hope you will address this case and take necessary action in upcoming models and im looking for fingerprint on screen rather than bottom of mobile and i have seen many of other manufacturers mobile has sms organizer feature which samsung doesnt have in any of the models i have not got any earphones with mobile which is again bad thing i may buy outside but i will not feel voice quality and i can not blame earphone or mobile and now you are sending sms to win an earphone which is other manufacturers product giving it to your beloved customers only for numbers waiting for ur next model with expected features and earphones
11426,1.0,speaker and mic not work hard ware is problem
11427,2.0,due to lighting the tvs mother board has gone and there is no authorized service center to resposne to problrem please ask related company to reach us at
11428,4.0,i bought these in the navy stripe and theyre soft and comfortable im between a small and a medium and the medium works here i could not have worn a small in these the narrow stripes make the pants flattering and the drape is lovely i wish they had pockets but i guess i cant have everything

11430,3.0,mobile software is old and same is running from long need to update new camera quality is dul rest all fine
11431,5.0,nice phone valuable
11432,2.0,i did not like the conditioner one bit it has a musky smell to it and the conditioner itself is very thickit was kind of hard to get it out of the bottle after applying it it made my dry frizzy hair feel very greasy and weighed down i prefer to use the shampoo and use a different conditioner i will not be purchasing again because of the smell and the fact that it did the opposite of adding thickness and volume to my hair
11433,1.0,faulty device
11434,4.0,christmas gift i havent opened them yet
11435,3.0,i love the smell of this product but it doesnt really do anything for my hair at this price in australia its not worth it
11436,1.0,third classwhy small jack with headphone if i want to clip headphone and chargng at the same timewhat one will do dont buy third class features instead buy note or note
11437,5.0,best way to make your dumb tv smart alexa is simply marvellous and is evolving everyday voice recognition streaming quality is superb alexa integration is seamless i just love it
11438,2.0,ordered this top online as i loved the colors and design but i should have listened to the other reviewers i ordered my usual size m and it was just very unflattering it was short and wide not at all like its pictured on the model needless to say it was immediately shipped back
11439,3.0,it shows in between no signal and battery also not good
11440,1.0,worst phone this is the worst phone of samsung brand i have never seen of samsung brandthe front camera is the like nothingpicture quality is too bad back camera is also not up to the expectations also amazon is not refunding the amount it is just wastage of hard earned money i ll suggest never to buy any phone from amazon of samsung brand
11441,3.0,it doesnt understand alot
11442,3.0,these lines of hair products seem nice i really like this one ive tried the coconut milk shampooconditioner tea tree oil mint shampooconditioner and a few others and this one is pretty good too its gentle on my highlightslowlights lathers up really nicely sells wonderful and leaves my hair once its dried silky smooth and soft only complaints i have is that i wish they would redo their bottle shapecap and i hate that my hair feels dried outsuper tangled before its dried
11443,1.0,i bought this with costco black friday deal and started using just a couple of days ago today when i was transferring video files from my phone to the card i wasnt able to because it stopped half way now nothing can be written on itit was purchased from costco so its not a fake microsdhc card i tested it out its authenticity with an app on google play and verified that its real too still its a piece junk what is sandisk doing to its reputationi would advise shopper to choose other brands over this surely its cheap but would you rather lose all of the important files that you store in it
11444,4.0,im tall lbs and im normally a size but i sized up to a size in this skirt and while it fit fine in the waist it was just too snug across the hips the fabric is heavy weight and i agree that the zipper should be longer the length is a bit long and dowdy for a pencil skirt its very straight it does not taper like pencil skirts normally do i would have kept this if it fit a curvier figure
11445,3.0,this top is very light and soft for summer even the lace is soft its not sheer and doesnt require layering true to size im dd lbs m fits well my arms are not tiny and yet the lace werent tight for me but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer its good if you are paying the sale price
11446,2.0,didnt like it i love organix shampoos but hated this one im a cosmetician and do lots of research on hair products im not saying this is a bad product because its not but this specific one dried out my hair the reason being is because people my age dont usually need keratin treatments so what i did was basically stressing out my hair by adding more of something that it already had this would probably work wonders for people who lack keratin just wasnt for me
11447,3.0,dont waste your money on this mobilewithin one week hanging problem
11448,2.0,stars as this product does not connect with y jabra bluetooth headphones waste of money for me could have bought a cheaper watch which would serve the purpose
11449,3.0,this serum was waaaay better than the coconut milk serum this one is thinner and smelled better and did a little more for my hair i have dry hair and i used this back before i knew anything about hair this served as a defrizzer for me and it worked well for that it made my hair shiny and soft but it wasnt as beneficial in the longrun for my hair thats what silicones the big component in this product do they make your hair look good in the now but as soon as you wash it out it is in the same state as before after i learned more about hair i only used this for heat styling then i was introduced to paul mitchell super skinny serum which worked better for me during the heat styling occasions so i gave this product away now i just use pure almond oil argan oil or coconut oil on the ends of my hair and they do the same thing this serum did but they are beneficial to my hair in the long run as they improve moisture retention
11450,1.0,ecom curiar is very bed service i m not happy iphone
11451,3.0,the jumpsuit is very pretty but its definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter plus it sort of looks like pajamas on i am and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on tallerthin woman
11452,4.0,this feels so nice and light and summery nothing like a crisp white top for the season
11453,4.0,i fell in love with this dress as soon as i came across it online ordered the dress in a large and it fit perfectly im smaller on top and larger at the bottom pear shaped the dress fit well and hid all of my flaws only problem was that it wrinkled very easily and im wondering if i received a dress that was sitting around for awhile since it was covered with lint and white fuzz when i received it in the mail other than that the design was absolutely beautiful with incredible embroidery
11454,3.0,i returned this as it was way too boxyloose ordered a size small but probably needed to size down
11455,4.0,the book is great the book is divided into sessions or chapters related to day to day things it first gives new words then explains the origin of words so that one does not have to cram all the words in between tests make sure that the words are committed well to memory the only drawback this book has is printing paper which is not that finebut who cares if one can learn new words at the cost of paper
11456,2.0,i was given this card in october to add to my new samsung galaxy s i was thrilled i copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile ipod substitute leaving my ipod classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradleeverything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago i started getting messages that seemed to say that i had removed and inserted the memory card of course i hadnt touched it then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that i needed to reformat it well i tried reformatting after that nothing nothing at all i pulled the memory card reset the phone reinserted the card nothing i tried the card in the adapter on computers it wasnt even visiblei called sandisk tech support it didnt take terribly long to convince them that i had a problem but they quickly offered me two gb cards as a replacement i literally laughed at them i got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try if so thats a lousy business practice after bouncing me around a few time they agreed to send me an rma and a shipping label i duly sent the card off a couple of days ago to be frank i have no idea at all when i might receive a replacementif i werent already in the grips of sandisk i would buy another card the fact that of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem a fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as thisupdate well i do have to give sandisk credit for customer support i returned the card using the supplied ups label on a tuesday and i received a replacement by ups on the following monday thats very good service it does however increase my suspicion about the offer of two gb because the gb cards were out of stock if they were out of stock they sure got in stock in a big hurry in any event ive upped my rating to two stars
11457,5.0,i bought this online because i love the print on the dress and i was not disappointed it is gorgeous the waist on the dress is much looser than in the picture but i am fine with that i am and the dress length is accurate as shown in the picture
11458,3.0,the exterior of the product is good and sturdy but plastic components including door of the freezer etc are very flimsy on defrosting the alignment of the funnel in the chiller tray needs to be adjusted to ensure the drip does not fall in the fridge itself
11459,5.0,i ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable ill get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain
11460,3.0,call disconnection problem many times call get automatically disconnected within seconds this happens many time many time network issue will also happens which was not happening in my last phone
11461,5.0,picture quality is good because having w speaker sound quality is awesomescreen quality is also awesome dont think to much go for it i like it
11462,1.0,the camera quality is completely different than what is shown on amazon mp camera clicks the picture clicked on mp camera
11463,4.0,very nice design and color beige however i am athletic and i thought the petite small was a bit too short even for this cut and just a bit too tight in the upper arms when wearing over a lightweight long sleeve dress may work well over sleeveless will see if a regular small fits better but then the sleeves will be too long and not easily hemmed like the petite sleeves can be the fabric is a bit felty for a boiled wool but not a deal breaker
11464,1.0,very slow phone please dont buy you will get frustrated with the performance
11465,4.0,i upgraded from iphone s to iphone xr and im not regretting at all battery capacity camera speed everything seems perfect for me your budget is not enough to buy iphone max or max pro then definitely you can go for this you will not regret it
11466,4.0,im and this is a nice pencilfit sweater skirt that is soft not scratchy and long enough fun bias cut sweater pattern and pretty dark blue and black color
11467,2.0,after reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs lately all my usual l sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear all would have been ok if the top wasnt so darn short for reference im ft tall lb its weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
11468,1.0,touchpad response wrost taking much in readwrite so late open any window and application
11469,3.0,we have to increase battery power upto mah battery life is not ok

11501,5.0,ordered this on a whim in my normal size large and so glad i did its just beautiful the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers it has a soft fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual the sleeves have elastic it just flows nicely over the body and isnt oversized like so many tops theres a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back its a beauty
11502,4.0,after reading all the reviews i figured at off i could at least try it im and typically wear a m or size i ordered the m but as other reviews stated the arms were tight since im expecting it to shrink and want it to cover my booty i ordered colors in the l its exactly the oversized slouchy look i wanted without the neckline being too low but will still be ok if it shrinks ill have these dry cleaned to minimize shrinkage its a wardrobe staple that looks great with

11521,3.0,very attractive pattern and color the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia the length was fine the fabric meaning the dress is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra areaeven though the facing didnt successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra the dress runs very large i ordered an xs petite it was about inches too large inches total on either side across the
11522,4.0,my first impression about vivo u the design of this device is quite impressive and stylish and the built quality is also very good the device is little heavy and big in size camera quality is also very good in this price range wide angle mood is fantastic but there are very few features in camera mode ai sticker mode and document scan mode are not present there are so many attractive features in smart motion settings speaker is producing low sound device is very fast battery life is excellent i will update my review after using the device for few days

11527,3.0,i like the idea of the pullover the quality of is nice the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch i expected this sweater to be more flattering though it is true to size but the length is strange it seems a bit too long yet is too short to look like a longer tunic or maybe the waistline is a little low whatever it is it makes me look like i have short legs also the collar wont stay down the way it is shown in the picture but it may work better for someone wi
11528,2.0,i was struggling with the options above does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large it is both too small and too large which is really strange the model makes this shirt look stunning but the product is actually very boxy i am weigh lbs and i typically order anywhere from a prxxsxs i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy quite frankly it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money

11542,3.0,i am your old customer and faith trust on your amazon want to return due to two reasons firstly whole description was not on website page as only length of the mobile was only mentioned as inches but width was not mentioned as the product is launched on site but not launched on local market so thats why i was unable to get knowledge of the product from local market ie regarding its size clarity or camera quality as per publicized as which is not as per the quality it should have so for both reasons i like to return the said story was already to customer care for its return days back but he denies to return but says that he can replace only not return so i request you to return the product please clear the scene
11543,1.0,i was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much sadly no first of all they run small i am between a s and xs in most brands bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side these felt a little snug and short but i decided to keep them the first time i washed them they were ruined i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer plus a delicate cycle no dryer the lace is man

11552,4.0,good design compact sizeover all value for money
11553,3.0,this is a beautiful looking dress but definitely runs wide and long im llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked even though i normally never go with petites it is a gorgeous dress and would probably work on those ladies who are taller

11565,2.0,this dress is adorable in the photo however in reality it fits like a tent the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it it flares out in the skirt to become an aline and its just not very flattering if i had read the reviews before ordering i would have sized down but i ordered before any reviews had been posted sadly i must return

11567,3.0,i ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders however im finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me the quality is nice it is medium in weight it has a cottony feeling but it not super soft it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me i wanted to love it but i only just like it i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun loose look in a sweater

11571,3.0,this shampoo claims to moisturize instead it makes my hair feel really dry but i like that its gentle on my scalp my scalp flakes badly when i use sulfate shampoos during the colder months and so im using this shampoo to tide me over until springsummer comes along when i can use my regular shampoos again i still flake but not as bad it makes my hair feel a little weighed down but like i said im using this temporarily smells amazing in the shower but the scent doesnt linger too long after washing its affordable for a sulfatefree shampoo if youre into all that rage the conditioner that accompanies it doesnt do anything for your hair i have to use my regular conditioner to comb through the tangles this shampoo leaves me with i can see that youd definitely need a clarifying shampoo every few weeks or so overall i like this shampoo but i wont repurchase once im done using it
11572,5.0,awesomeproduct

11574,4.0,i bought both colors the navy is beautiful but the grey is closer to a drab beige and the color really disappointed me ill be returning that one i love love the fit and feel of the sweater it drapes wonderfully whether open or closed and its so soft however the fabric pilled significantly big pills not even little ones where my arms touch my sides after just four wears i get that rayon is finicky but that is ridiculous the navy is now out of stock in my size so i guess ill try t
11575,2.0,very disappointed runs small in chest and too long the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail i dont think this dress is worth the price it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze i have been in the fashion industry for over years and this is a miss mark in my opinion put it back on the rack and save your for something better at sweet retailer
11576,1.0,this left a lot of buildup and made my hair look limp but matted definitely the worst conditioner i have tried from the line it does smell good to my nose and softens well but i will have to pass on this plus im glad i only bought the travel size i really wanted to like this but will have to pass on to my sister to see if she might like it better oh well
11577,1.0,this phone is draining so quicklywith minimal usage it came for about hours and hanging so much its even taking minutes to restart everyday this phone surprises me with a new kind of problem asked for a refundreplacement but customer care executives are saying blancoo app is saying your phone is fine but in reality its not ridiculous phone and ridiculous experience with amazon

11676,4.0,its a beautiful print and design the shirt overall is a little short but untucked it can work i dont know why everybody is making these short square little tops overall i am intrigued with the whimsical print and i like that enough to overlook the length
11677,4.0,i really love this dress just not on me i am very curvy with a rounder stomach i normally wear a lbs and the fit but it is so fitted that i didnt like how it showed everything if i had a flatter stomach i would have kept it but it just doesnt work on my body style unless i wanted to constantly be pulling it down it was riding up a bit the fabric is great the color and pattern are so lovely i almost ignored my instinct and kept it anyway my boyfriend who is picky
11679,5.0,i ordered the neutral in a p i had to hem them i about lbs i wore them to wore they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen but they didnt look like i slept in them i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair a bit disappointed debating if theyll stay or get returned i see the notes about stretching overall a nice pant for the money
11680,5.0,very bad product and i got damaged product its corners were not good when i tightly hold my finger than some noise is coming i think its not damaged but because of the body but it has very bad camera so please dont buy for camera it is only made for watching videos and sound is good videos are good because of super amoled display and sound is good because of dolby atmos only when it is connected with headphone or earpiece battery backup is very poor i suggest dont invest your money on this and very bad respond from amazon the replace is also not available please if your samsung ms body sound is coming when you hold then tell me i think it was because of polycarbonate maybe

11683,5.0,great service with genuine product
11684,1.0,i purchased this product because i was looking for a great smelling sulfate free alternative to what i normally use to start off with the price was a bit expensive at target i wouldnt mind paying that if the product actually worked the conditioner was a watery horrible smelling atrocity that made my hair more tangled than it was before using it after drying my hair was filmy and nasty i will definitely not repurchase

11691,3.0,i bought this for my child who later complained that the phone lags and the battery consumption is high i called the customer care and they refused to refund or even upgrade to a highercostlier version of mi redmi mobile i researched online and found that android ver requires at least gb ram for a seamless experience the technical support executive agreed to this but said that the mobile can only be replaced with the same model only if the piece were defective so the lessons learned are research about the hardware requirements of the android version before you buy if possible try out the same model at some offline store or elsewhere before you buy note that there are no refunds or upgrades possible after you purchase from amazon youll be stuck with what you buy as for this mobile after using it for sometime i find the performance as ordinary if your use is high then go for better versions or mobiles

11701,1.0,i loved how soft this dress was as well as versatile however i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams unfortunately the fabric is so soft but rather thin and it didnt hold the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldnt put it in the washing machine again especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because its so old and barely agitates would love this if it was made a little be
11702,2.0,pros massive battery decent camera cons poor speaker modem has an issue network strength and call qualitythis is due to exynos processor snapdragon performs better slow charging even though its a av w charger no screen casting in the same price range you have other phines that perform better than this this was not worth the money spent

11706,2.0,im and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if youre and above it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm body and skirt a belt was no match for that much fabric the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made but the design was awful

11719,2.0,i would not recommend this conditioner it does not smell like good coconuts it has a gross almost sour smell to it the product is actually very watery and you have to use a lot to even get a little bit moisture i would not recommend buying this as its expensive for the product considering how much you have to use
11720,5.0,ive been using this with the conditioner and i looooove it the smell is awesome and not too over powering i has made my hair so soft and it feels very healthy i recommend this for someone with dry hair my fiance tried it and it just made his hair more greasy using this has made me want to try out the paul mitchell awapuhi line but im a poor college student so that wont be happening so until i can afford a dollar shampoo i will be at the organix section at ulta

11724,2.0,honestly so disgusting my aunt gave this to me and i absolutely hate it i have almost pure argan oil from pyt and it is amazing so using this was so gross its really thick and honestly provided nothing for my hair argan oil is one of the last things on the list meaning theres barely any actual argan oil in it honestly save your money up for actual moroccanargan oil
11725,5.0,i get a lot of compliments on this dress its bright and cheerful for sure it runs maybe a bit large but is a great summer dress
11726,4.0,excellent item in this range
11727,3.0,purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in mayperfect with sandals for casual and dinner so sad that it was not as i had hoped the fabric is a bit heavy and the sleeves are very tight i have thin arms the color is a bit off as the background color is a gray which doesnt flatter the yellow design i purchased the large as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow but it was very tight all around especially around the bust area going to have to return this
11728,3.0,just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but its just a little too big and boxy im lbs and ordered a small but i really wish id ordered the xs not sure if ill exchange or just return seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous its basically exactly what im looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like im wearing my grandpas old sweater
11729,1.0,some my wrist pains after wearing it
11730,4.0,stars for the excellent price and performance seems to be as advertised average copying speeds are around mbsonly gripe is that sandisk doesnt include any extras ie a plastic protective case or bundle it with a sd card reader however can understand why at this price point
11731,5.0,my parents are happy they dont need too much it satisfies their small requirements batter life is good camera quality is also upnto the mark it doesnt have a finger print scanner but its not required for them my parents doesnt use the face recognition so no idea how does it work overall i am happy with the purchase
11732,3.0,its not worth to buy this phone even it has a great processor but it lags while playing online games and also it lags even in normal usage too
11733,2.0,ordered online and when it came i was very excited to open it but the photo doesnt show how incredibly wide the cut is it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me the embroidery is lovely but the style doesnt work i had a small but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height might work better on someone with a more petite frame but i do caution how voluminous the cut
11734,3.0,the sound signature and product quality is above par in this price range though the cable length is bit long but if there is any issue and product is to be serviced during warranty period then its a really different story altogether its been more than a month and i am yet to receive my servicedreplaced unit and i dont have any way to get any further update to my ticket and my unit its strange that the customer care number and support email ids are there but those are not monitored well it seems
11735,1.0,it charges only one time and that to not i have to put my phone on socket charger i i want it charged second its bulky and cumbersome third its better life is not good after one charge i have to put it on charging and it takes time to get fully charged based on my experience its not good product and its expensive
11736,3.0,if the sweater looked as it does in the picture i would keep it however it was very boxy and short a style that does not work for me at all im ft in and ordered the medium i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting unfortunately i will have to return the sweater
11737,1.0,i am very much disappointed the product stopped working immediately on completion of return period my return period expired on and power bank stopped functioning on
11738,1.0,sound is not as expected same is trying to return jayavardhan s
11739,3.0,samsung m offers a decently high batteryalthough not a perfect mah battery lasts about a day with medium to high usage although the ram is gb apps take a while to open and close which is a major setback of this phone processing speed is also quite slow which is again a setback user interface is very nice better than xiaomi at least because it doesnt have annoying ads camera is fairly good for its specification for it can take moderate photographs with average sharpness and resolution
11740,2.0,product is to bad
11741,1.0,vodafone sim does not work how can samsung release the phone without testing properly have tried every possible solution got a replacement from amazon after wasting many hours on the call which has exactly the same issue really frustrating

11744,5.0,great power bank value for money if you looking for a good quality power bank go for it
11745,1.0,waste for money
11746,3.0,i am torn about this dress the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent it is tricky to pull off if you are wellendowed on the top or wear a padded bra i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultrathin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well i usually dont return online purchases unless they
11747,5.0,super flattering and lovely material dressup or down they run true to size
11748,2.0,phone gets heat up and battry back up is very poor called up amazon customer service for return but they routed to technical team all in all amazon is no more a customer friendly company this phone is not worth the money paid
11749,4.0,amazing
11750,2.0,i love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online being i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint however being also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short it looks ridiculous i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in degree weather unfortunately after waiting so long for its arrival this is going back

11762,1.0,system drives will never get opened at any point of time
11763,4.0,good smart watch to track daily details
11765,3.0,i finally finished up my container of this product it lasted me just over months and although i didnt use it daily i would estimate i used it about days per week on average the paackaging is okay but i did not like that this product is constantly exposed to the air when i was using it i would prefer a squeeze tube for a thick product that is able to dry out if the lid is not on i found it tedious to constantly unscrew and screw the cap back on with every use i also have long nails and disliked that product would usually get trapped under them after use since you have to dig into this product due to the packaging i have hair that is down to my bra strap in the back and i prefer to use a pea sized amount if i use more than that my hair can look stringy i only applied this to the bottom half of my hair and not the roots i love the smell it smells like true coconut and not that sweet fake coconut fragrance at first i used this in conjunction with the shampoo and conditioner from the same line then later with organix sea mineral moisture shampoo and conditioner it behaved approximately the same with both but i will mention i vastly prefer the sea mineral line to this coconut curls line because my hair really needs the moisture and became a bit dried out when i was using only the coconut curls products i used this on its own for about half the tub then for the other half of the tub of product i used it mixed with its a serum i like neither one of these leave in conditioners alone but have really been enjoying them mixed together i used one pea size of this hair butter and then one half a squirt of the its a serum i decided to mix them because when used alone this product did take away frizz and make hair smoother and more moisturized looking but my hair was not actually benefiting from it i still got the same amount of split ends when i went for my hair trims and dryness at the ends of my hair on days when i didnt use it with the combo i have had slightly less split ends and my ends are more moisturized when i skip any hair products and just shampoo and condition due to laziness overall i will not be repurchasing and will continue experimenting with new products i wouldnt recommend this because there is no lasting benefit to using this in my opinion and to me that is the whole point of using a leave in treatment
11766,1.0,with in month jack not working
11767,5.0,i did not even pause over this dress on line a white lace dress now well my local retailer at lenox atlanta which has a petites department had this dress in the window with a jean jacket being a lace geek i went in to find it i am a big fan of the feminine and dressy dressed down great window display idea this picture does not do anything for the dress except wash out the true color the lining is ivory that vintage sepia photo look ivory the lace is lovely ivory too and the

11772,4.0,i was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is it has a wonderful drape and hand to it i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher it seems that everything is too lowcut for my modest taste but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets so im not terribly concerned
11773,3.0,i didnt know what to put for runs small true to size or runs large but it required me to put somethingi first ordered the xl and it was ridiculously gianormous the next time i ordered a large i thought the large would either be a perfect fit or still too large based on how the xl had fit the large was too tight i could not believe it it is too bad for i love the design and color of this top i ordered it in the muted red color if you can find a size that works for you go for

11779,2.0,warrning stripped color from hair i had colored my hair a couple of weeks ago with garnier fructis herbashine deep burgundy it was a very pretty dark shiny color before that i had a med chestnut color with light caramel highlights i decided to try this last night i washed my hair with the clarifying shampoo twice let it air dry for a bit then applied the straighting product all seemed well although i do think i may have used a bit much but i have long thick hair amp wanted to make sure to get it all covered when i started to blow dry it felt super coated amp waxy i thought i would never get it dry it did dry after awhile but felt so sticky amp gross i noticed then it looked a bit lighter i could see my old highlights a bit but nothing to drastic i thought maybe the clarifying shampoo removed some of the color then i started straighting it as soon as i did the first pass with the straightener i was shocked to see the coloring lighting right in front of my eyes it turned a light brassy color i almost ran in amp washed it out from my hair right then but i didnt know what to do i now had this one section of hair that was bone straight amp light amp the rest still curly amp dark after a lot of hand ringing i decided to finish the process its now the second day amp my hair is super straight but it feels so nasty i cant wait to wash it out all the dark color that was in my hair is gone its now back to the highlighted look but even lighter than it originally was amp brassy i will update after the first wash bit unless it does wonders for my curlyfrizzy hair i will never try it again

11789,5.0,super soft pretty blue green color packs super well for traveling
11790,5.0,there is nothing to like i regret my decision to use their product

11795,3.0,c jeans dress ordered a small and a medium never tried on the medium the small was a little big in the waist but what threw me for a loop was the chest huge could work if its meant to be blousey but the armholes were massive if an xs is returned i might give it a shot but i cant imagine what women who are smaller than me are going to do in this jumpsuit great color transitions into fall easily cannot be belted or wear a camisole due to the opening at the stomach sh
11796,3.0,picked this up on a whim at the drugstore havent used any hair masks before but i expected more this isnt more effective than a conditioner if you put it on for about minutes i tried putting it on for min like it says on the container today and my hair does feel lovely and soft and manageable but its still underwhelming for the price smells fantastic though but after i finish my tub i wont be buying again
11797,5.0,a monster mobile with monstor specifications but miniature pricing this beast easily beats all the high end mobiles of other brands and its own other variants in various specifications like camera battery and the pricing you can close your eyes and purchase this mobile you wont regret it for sure
11798,2.0,i ordered these cards at a great price during black friday weekweekend i began loading some files music videos pics etc the first card worked without any problems the second card started giving me cyclic redundancy errors at first i thought it was my hard drive that was failing and tried to copy the same files to a flash drive which worked just fine ok maybe i received a dud and tried with another card from my purchase same results cyclic redundancy error i started searching online and found a utility via one of the reviews on amazon called htestw ran the test on both cards and it reported errors it also reported write speed of only mbsec which is way below advertised speeds these items were in retail packaging and i remember reading about the bulk package items being fakes i guess the retail package cards arent any betteri should have waited to do the refund because now i have to process the refund seperately i will test another card to see if i have better luck i wanted to leave a star but i gave stars since card worked so far i have more to testvery dissapointed because i was a fan of the sandisk ultra series for being reliable but i guess they are cheaping out on quality to increase their profit i would have been extremely upset if i used these cards for anything important
11799,5.0,love this sweater i purchased both the green and gray versions and will wear them constantly this winter although some reviews were critical of the feel of the yarn i do not find this to be a problem so happy with these products for reference to size i bought the m and am the sweater hits me exactly where it does on the model

11809,2.0,note the sleeves on the model that is how your regular size will fit your arms however even if you have skinny arms like i do the sleeves will be tight i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only ft in i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon

11817,1.0,as much as i buy from retailer this is my first review the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person i wanted something that was a bit flowy but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie the most unflattering dress ever and since its only available online im not interested enough to try a smaller size

11824,3.0,k for this product and no memory card option wow besides this the phone is ok good speed but the memory card slot not being there was a bitter disappointment
11825,5.0,bought this for my wife on our anniversary we have an echo in the area of the kitchen family room living room and use it all the time she has it in the bedroom so she can play her music her flash briefings and check weather etcalso bought one for our daughter and oldest grandson they use the daily
11826,2.0,i absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that id be wearing them all summer long they fit beautifully were true to size and seemed to go with every top i owned unfortunately on the second wear the inseam completely unraveled leaving a footlong gaping hole in the leg i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams so im not thrilled with the quality it seems like they were poorly manufactured im not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t
11827,3.0,i ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back i went with a medium but that ended up running too big i typically wear between a and a small and medium so im always on the fence about which size to get i often order both online and return the one that doesnt fit as well so i wish i had this time too the detail on the front is super cute and i didnt even mind the plainer back but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li

11831,3.0,as with other maeve dresses the fit is great i love the empire waist with stud details the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip im not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything when i first saw this online i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online however only the smallest size had the great snake on the back
11832,3.0,this is a cute top but unfortunately when i washed it delicate cold water line dry it shrunk excessively in length im very disappointed

11836,5.0,hey guys if you are thinking of purchasing the iphone on a budget chances are that you already know its best for you but if you wanna know some extra stuff its here just pay a look and youll be glad you did this is my review for the iphone xr pros gorgeous colorful design daylong battery life great performance strong camera easy to use software cons screen resolution could be higher portrait mode limited to people the iphone xr is the best iphone of the year yes the iphone xs and xs max have better screens and more versatile cameras but neither of them look as gorgeous as the xr in yellow blue or coral the iphone xr pronounced tenr is also significantly more affordable and carries many of the best features from the flagships its an unquestionably superb value at especially if youre still shopping around for an iphone and the price tag on the xs is bringing you down colorful design solid screen we cant stop holding the iphone xr the wrong way round sure the screen is a window to our apps and notifications but its the brilliant bright yellow color on the back that makes us smile every time we pull this phone out of our pocket we feel like gollum constantly admiring the beauty of the one ring its perfection if youre buying the iphone xr and you should we cant fathom the idea of going for the black or white colors for the first time since the iphone c youre getting rich colorful choices from apple red blue yellow and coral on top of black and white this is a phone youll want to flaunt and we strongly encourage going for the yellow blue or coral colors the productred color looks good too but weve seen it many times already so it doesnt feel as special the colors also mask any fingerprints that gather on the glass back the edges around the phone are aluminum a step down from the stainless steel in the iphone xs and xs max but the color here is more metallic providing a nice complementary twotone look the buttons are clicky as usual the iphone xr looks a lot like the iphone from the back with its singlecamera lens but flip it over and it you get the full iphone x treatment theres a notch no home button and an edgetoedge screen for the most modern ios experience you can get at this price the differences between the xs are noticeable here as the black bezels around the screen are thicker still the bezels arent so large that they bulk up the device thats good because the xr has a large inch lcd screen with x resolution apple calls it the liquid retina display and while the screen resolution may sound a little low it looks sharp at the distance you typically hold your phone look closer and pixels will start to be visible we think apple could have added at least a p screen here youll hardly find an android phone in this price range with such a lowresolution screen even the oneplus has x resolution that said its difficult to find much else wrong with the display black levels arent as deep as the oleds on the xs and xs max but theyre close the screen is colorful and its plenty bright enough for use outdoors we think the screen will be good enough for most people but its among the xrs few shortcomings the iphone xr does have the advantage of being the perfect size for people who find the xs too small and the xs max too big at inches it sits right in between the flagships slightly smaller than samsungs galaxy s plus its not as easy to use one handed as the inch iphone xs but we can still reach most parts of the screen and its not as cumbersome as the inch xs max which is undoubtedly a twohanded phone face id is the primary way you will unlock the phone and it works just as fast as on the iphone xs at the price range its one of the few facial recognition tools you can use to log into secure apps theres not a lot of competition here on the android side though that may be starting to change the stereo speakers on the iphone xr are loud and sound good though the audio is not as dynamic or robust as the sound coming out of the speakers from the razer phone youll be satisfied listening to them if youre in a quiet room but they will struggle outdoors if its noisy theres no headphone jack and apple has also decided not to include the mm headphone jack adapter in the box anymore you can opt for the included lightning earpods which dont sound great or shell out for wireless earbuds or headphones great performance and ios is fluid the iphone xr is powered by the same chipset inside its more expensive siblings the a bionic though it comes with less ram gb instead of gb weve yet to see it run into performance issues the processor makes ios fluid to operate and had no problem swiftly swapping through multiple apps games like altos odyssey and tekken as well as arkit games like ar robot run flawlessly geekbench cpu singlecore multicore in geekbench the iphone xr rightly scores just under the iphone xs and xs max but its faster than any android smartphone weve tested to date this phone can tackle almost anything you throw at it weve taken a close look at ios but the iphone xr is the first time apple is bringing several new features that debuted on the iphone x to a lower price point for example you can create animojis or memojis in imessage thanks to the truedepth camera theres no home button so you will need to get used to the gesture navigation system which is among the best available on a phone the xr does not feature d touch but apple has replicated this with a feature it calls haptic touch d touch on the iphone xs allows you to utilize the pressuresensitive display to press and hold down on certain parts of the user interface to reveal more actions for example pressing and holding down on an email notification would pull up the ability to mark it done haptic touch is more limited it only works in select areas such as the control center when you want to expand a tile or on the lockscreen if you want to quickly toggle the flashlight on or off how much youll miss d touch depends entirely on how much you use it and we suspect most people dont use it frequently strong camera the iphone xr has the same main camera on the back of the iphone xs a megapixel lens with a f aperture and optical image stabilization it can shoot k framespersecond video can record stereo sound packs smart hdr and for the first time you can use portrait mode without the need for the secondary lens weve tested the improvements of the iphone xs main camera over the iphone x and while theyre not radical groundbreaking changes smart hdr does give the new camera the edge that feature helps with highcontrast scenarios minimizing blown out lights or skies and brightening up the foreground to make it visible it works as advertised on the iphone xr producing excellent photos in extreme lighting conditions though it doesnt quite match the quality of hdr on the google pixel like the more expensive iphones or flagship android devices the camera app has nearly zero shutter lag that helps capture detailed wellexposed photographs that retain strong color it holds its own in lowlight scenarios too though you need to make sure you stay still to prevent a blurry photo we do miss the telephoto lens included on the iphone xs and xs max the x optical zoom lets you take shots that wont look as good digitally zooming in on the iphone xr going back to a singlelens camera forces us to change the way we take some photos physically moving closer to the subject instead of standing at a distance the lack of the secondary lens also affects portrait mode which lets you take photos of a subject with a blurred effect behind them mimicking a dslr were quite happy portrait mode is available on the xr as its the first time apple has included it on a singlelens camera phone portrait lighting is also available but there are only three choices as opposed to the five on the xs natural studio and contour the iphone xr doesnt zoom in to take portrait mode photos like the xs giving you more room to work with its not as accurate as the xs and xs max but weve been impressed so far in low light its photos werent as grainy as the iphone xs however portrait mode only works on people and thats disappointing on the iphone xs portrait mode can work on food people objects pets and almost anything the xr camera however uses this mode partly with the help of artificial intelligence and neural nets its trained on identifying a face and thats why its capable of outlining people so accurately when you try to take a portrait photo of a dog or an object the camera will say no person detected and it wont even try googles pixel smartphone has a singlelens camera and does a darn good job of using portrait mode on a variety of subjects were hoping apple can expand portrait mode on the xr to be a bit more versatile over time with software the frontfacing camera is the same truedepth camera system as the iphone xs so youll be able to take excellent portrait mode selfies here it even worked with our dog this megapixel camera snaps great shots in standard mode as well while the iphone xrs camera isnt as versatile as the iphone xs or xs max its still topnotch and the photographs it captures are excellent dont worry about the battery the iphone xrs battery wont give you anxiety its a mah unit and we frequently ended a work day with around or percent remaining by pm thats taking it off the charger around am and using the phone for browsing the web taking pictures streaming music and playing games on lighter days of use we hit percent by pm this phone will easily get you through a full day and it may be able to stick around for a few hours the following day if you forget to charge it this daylong battery life is on par with other phones on the market like the galaxy s plus and even the iphone xs max it easily beats googles pixel and xl which struggle to endure a day of moderate to heavy use it supports fastcharging but the appropriate cable isnt included sadly you can also wirelessly charge this iphone just like you can with the xs series and last years iphone devices price availability and warranty information the iphone xr starts at and its available for preorder now with official sales starting october you can check out our buying guide for the best deals and prices apple offers a oneyear limited warranty that protects the device from manufacturing defects you can purchase applecare for additional protection verdict unquestionable superb value thats the iphone xr it may be missing a few features but this is the iphone that will make others yellow blue or coral with envy the colors are stunning battery life is great face id is still industryleading technology ios gestures are intuitive the camera is superb and performance is fantastic this is the iphone to buy is there a better alternative yes if you want all the bells and whistles buy the iphone xs or iphone xs max theyre more expensive but you gain better build quality a nicer and sharper screen as well as a more versatile camera if is too high apple is still selling the iphone and iphone at discounted prices and theyre excellent phones though not as futuristic over on the android side youre spoiled for choice our pick however is the google pixel it costs a bit more but you gain a slightly better camera excellent software with fast updates and a highresolution screen how long will it last apples iphones usually last four to five years if not more the iphone xr is ip rated instead of ip that means you can take it underwater up to meter for minutes and no more while apple says its the most durable glass on the back and front its wise to buy a case to protect the phone apple is selling a clear case for the iphone xr in case you dont want to hide the gorgeous colored body expect to get software updates for the next four to five years the iphone s which released in is the oldest iphone capable of running ios so youre getting a good deal of longevity out of your device should you buy it absolutely buy it in product red you wont be disappointed

11865,3.0,i was so excited bout this top it looks adorable on the model but was not as flattering in person the white is see through so you will need a tank underneath which looks off with the mock neckline i bought the two other colors which are so pretty but the length of the top hit me at my hips it def does not have the length as described or measured in the description im and wear an xs and the size was right but length hit at my hips which is my widest part of my body if you have tiny h

11867,3.0,i do not get the advertised speed of mbs more like a kbs on my galaxy s at least it gives me a lot of extra storage space for a phone it works nicely if you dont need to transfer big files
11868,4.0,camera quality is good but battery backup is average and fingerprint reader is awesome
11869,3.0,i read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it first the good i love the color the fabric and the design its very lightweight and loosefitting and is perfect for hot days the neck and sleeves are pretty on i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things now the bad it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package im surprised a
11870,2.0,this is one of those you can tell from the hanger that its not going to work too boxy too short and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an oversized childs shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine
11871,1.0,the color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget a very cheap polyester on top of that it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way so you can bet that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing ive attached a picture of the hem below on top of that the ruching is awkward as mentioned by another reviewers all in all kind of terrible

11875,3.0,this sweater is extremely roomy the cut is very wide wider than it is long the sleeves are dolman style and the neck is a little loose with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasnt wearing a tent but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin if you can im keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because im exploring funky town lately join me at your own risk

11880,4.0,i bought this dress for a wedding but decided it wasnt dressy enough and ended up exchanging it even though i really wanted to keep it i ordered a xs and it fit like a glove the gathering makes for a forgiving and flattering look and the color is absolutely gorgeous very classy length for such a form fitting dress too i probably would have cut down the neck if i ended up keeping it bc hightight turtlenecks arent my thing which is reason for only stars
11881,2.0,i would say honestlybatterie life is pretty poori wouldnt recommended this phone for anyoneone of the major problem is earphone and changing point same you can do only one thing at same time either charge or put your earphone
11882,4.0,no one will have any doubt about the apple product except the cost rating only because of prices only
11883,3.0,its a little bulky and takes a very long time to charge
11884,2.0,speaker problem voice is not going out when speaker is on during call checked with mi service center they told that sw needs to be updated little bit disappointed as i gifted this phone to my fatherwill provide more update once we get the phone updated with sw i recieved the mobile from service senter but after days again same problem started now service centre is saying that motherboard needs to be changethis is really frustratingnot at all happy with this kind of product is being saled by amazon
11885,2.0,not a good
11886,4.0,battery mah powerhouse takes a bit time to charge but stays for sufficient time camera though mp still lacks details and depth good lighting and a lot of functions for serious clickers screen super amoled screen is the biggest eyepopper for this phone as screen really feels good to eyes with awesome colours and wide display processor the processor is working just fine but samsung phones become slow after some time overall considering the brand samsung and net price cant ask for morejust good software updates thanks to amazon for amazing deal
11887,4.0,i was surprised at how soft this sweater is i thought for a brief moment it was cashmere im a little worried it might pill we shall see it is a pretty and classy sweater will look great with jeans and heels or boots it looks somewhat long on the model it wasnt quite as long on me which was a bit disappointing im with long torso not abnormally long its still a great sweater and will be great for upcoming holidays parties
11888,3.0,only normally use
11889,3.0,in this price range we can get something best then this battery life is not that much what expected it drains very fast if you use or not picute quality is fine but not as praisable

11893,4.0,love alexa soo much just wish she could constantly wake me up at a sertant time every day
11894,4.0,im desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone i wanted this cute print to work and it can but its just not great the material is almost spandexy which is a bit weird the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps making the neck and the arms higher than i like if i go up a size it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist so close
11895,5.0,i got this phone in thanks to sbi and amazon great india sale best phone by apple in this price range
11896,5.0,i added this to a stack of tryons on my trip to retailer today not expecting to be impressed by this number but was blown away when i tried it on dollars is a little pricey but didnt hesitate it was so beautiful i am a b and normally wear a size and the small fit perfectly cant wait to wear it on vacation in new orleans in a couple of weeks
11897,3.0,i really wanted to love this i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange it cut my off in the most unflattering spot
11898,4.0,took awhile to get online didnt understand if it only worked with wifi smart phone according to instructions in box or by lap top finally hookedup with lap topanyway finding ways to use it kinda fun helpful at the same time old school guy with new school toy

11904,3.0,im just not sure about this top its very short im shortwaisted and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me and as another reviewer pointed out theres no closure in front i cant imagine wearing it without a tank underneath one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show it really seems more like a vest than a shirt its cute enough with a tank underneath but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top its too hot for layers in the s
11905,4.0,i agree with the other reviewer that the color isnt as pink in person and more subtle my thoughts below on some other things pros pockets makes it so fun and chic with the overall style the material is lovely and breathable i didnt find it sheer at all of course i didnt wear it outside the dressing room the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well runs mostly tts i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest i
11906,4.0,this is a beautiful piece for the price very well made and flattering im a c and usually wear a size on top and solid size on bottom a size small in this fit great it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that

11908,4.0,phone is working nice rear camera quality is decent however the front camera is good
11909,5.0,i just bought these jeans today i absolutely love them i usually wear a or in any jean depending on the fit i bought these in the regular they fit so perfect they definitely are not a legging fit nor are they a baggy boyfriend style on the tag these jeans are described as a girl fit slim with a dash of ease that describes the fit of these perfectly they are not tight not baggy at all just a bit of ease at least on me i am the regular length is perfect the fab
11910,2.0,its been months till today the speaker stopped working the phone is lagging it hangs and is slow while operating i have left gb free and only whatsapp and mx player apps are installed still it hangs a lot and freezes
11911,4.0,this dress has a really lovely design and is very very comfortable it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped and doesnt have quite as defined a shape as i expected still its cute and im happy to have it
11912,5.0,the product is having awesome super fast processor anytime go for gb ram variant face recognition works fine but theres no such requirement of it as fingerprint reader is super fast camera is best in this segment also having the front flash having the android one is the big advantage over miui

11920,1.0,we bought this for our office use the general usage is only in excel word and mails even for this activity the system is dead slow it switches off quite often we did not expect this quality from reputed manufacturer like hp we are disappointed after submitting this response on rd july not a single response from hp this shows their careless attitude for defective model i used to always buy hp product for personal use and official use this attitude will change my mind and will not take hp at face value again disappointed
11921,4.0,the product seems to be good i have just started using the drawback is the cable provided with the product is too small its difficult to keep it hanging while you charge nice to have an adapter in the box will update the performance at a later stage
11922,4.0,delivery takes lot of time apart from that product was gud
11923,3.0,a good choice for people looking for low budget phonebuilt quality is good and is light weightcamera performance is averagegood in daylight condition not impressive for low light video quality is good and can record hd videossound quality is above average performance is very good but dont expect heavy gaming support expect battery life for a day usage and little more pros separate memory card slot potrait mode in front camera good battery backup impressive pricing cons no finger print sensor no potrait mode in rear camera
11925,2.0,i absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt if only the cut wasnt so odd the sides of the skirt wing out for a very distracting and unflattering look the stiff feltlike quality of the material only makes matters worse in that respect the model photos are not at all accurate it also runs large i had to go down one full size
11926,2.0,old product given to me
11927,2.0,on the th day from the date of purchase of redmi note pro both the speakers became unserviceable
11928,2.0,maybe its my curves or the way im only but this was a hot mess on me it is soooo long and cut to low for my d chest it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs go for it had to send back
11929,4.0,i bought this ph yr before and i find it good although sometimes it gives me trouble but that is fine as compare to what we are paying in this comparative world

11931,5.0,this dress is very pretty versatile and high quality im planning to wear it to a wedding with the holiday season coming up i will definitely get to use it as well the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part its very soft i usually wear an xs petite this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but its manageable i have this dress in ivory top
11932,4.0,i have used this a few times now and can day i have been fairly suprised by this serum because it wasnt hugely pricey i didnt have the highest expectations because my hair is so dry and damaged from straightening i usually find that the more expensive products work the best however on this occasion i have found this serum to be suprising it has made my hair softer shinier healthier looking as well as making it better to straighten whats even better is that you dont need a lot to see a difference in the condition of the hair which is why it comes in a neat little bottle would definitely consider buying it again if it continues to work well on my hair
11933,1.0,bought a redmi note on sep used to update miui whenever there is an update after the latest update to miui to last week the wifi detection function stopped working the service centers had no clue they reset my phone completely deleting my personal setup that did not solve the problem they came back and said that the phone needs a mainboard assy change and gave me a quotation for i stepped back and decided to look for another phone and that would certainly not an xiaomi or redmi google search also will tell you that this issue is commonly reported by redmi users there is a problem record in the miui support portal with no definite solution
11934,3.0,i like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large i am b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall
11935,5.0,life changing book this book can be your turning point if you use in regular life

11937,2.0,this top is gorgeous and i exchanged it times hoping it would work i originally got the size a would normally wear a and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem i then went all the way up to a size in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit

11944,2.0,i wanted to love this was so excited when i ordered it online the fabric blue and white was beautiful but the cut was bad it fit me like a maternity top and made me look like i was months along i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back in the back because it does not lay flat like that in front it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out returning
11945,3.0,decent phone no battery backup seems like some regular phone with lot of hype no monster heredisappointed but screen is gudand definitely not for gamers though it supports hd hdr settings their are lags and speaker quality is low and signal drop makes worst calling experience
11946,2.0,i agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large or something i ordered an xs my usual size xss the body of the shirt is very loose the upper arms are a bit snug and i dont have large arms the shoulder seams are in a very strange place but when you look at the model it doesnt look so bad with the shirt i received and another reviewer the seam was puffy making for a strange look in theory the shirt should have worked but didnt i loved the pattern not the fit
11947,1.0,panel defects and it shows the green line and white dot on panel horizantal as well as verticle and the meet point shows a white dot

11949,5.0,it is very handy compatible on this price its image quality of photos is very good this price range its finger print senser is awesome but face recognisation is jus little slow which is negligable also its perfect for gaming like pubg

11955,3.0,it seems to have a issue with the camera
11956,1.0,amazon making customer fool by selling this product camera quality is not megapixel even after my complaint they didnt reply correctly and denied to replace the item i suggest customers if they want to try this phone must try but if you want to replace you must bhi replace by saying item is diffective aur any other problem and if there is no problem you must create that problem
11957,4.0,cute shirt nice for layering
11958,4.0,best thing is the camera its quite good another surprise was mind blowing speakers stereo sound nice to watch videos overall much improved over t in my view its first oneplus model which ticks everything nice job done

11963,2.0,used this on my fine straight mediumthickness hair it turned out to be entirely too drying for my hair i used it with the matching conditioner and my hair was always dry and knotted after washing which was never the case before i love other lines by organix but i am not a fan of the tea tree mint line at all
11964,5.0,i used to be an apple hater but no other phone ever matches the gaming optimisation of the iphone xrxsxs max these devices with the a bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt people have been complaining about the display that is basically p but trust me you wont even notice the difference between a proper p screen and this one in fact this screen looks better than most of the p mobile phone screens thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses the camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it cant click portraits without detecting a human face ps you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits

11968,3.0,i really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places but i must say i have a ddd bust and wear a medium regularly well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didnt work it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump overall its cute just not for me
11969,4.0,actually i expected this charging capacity around or mah but its produce around mah only in this point of view i get disappointed and also little bit bulky otherwise its good
11970,5.0,inspiration
11971,2.0,i stupidly went through two bottles of this before realizing that this shampoo was causing more of my hair to fallout i am perimenopausal and my hair is starting to thin this shampoo cleanses well but is drying used along with the matching root stimulator spray did not help my particular hair situation i have much better luck and no increased hair loss with alterna clinical daily detox shampoo for thinning hair

11975,5.0,i have fine textured hair but its not thin even though i get highlights regularly my hair leans toward oily i have to wash daily or it looks greasy moisturizing shampoos tend to make it look too limp i didnt have high hopes when i tried this out but i was pleasantly surprised it doesnt dry me out it leaves my hair soft and shiny but not weighed down this isnt the only shampoo i use i have several i like and i use a clarifying one at least once a week so i dont give anything a chance to build up too much on my hair my best friend asked what i had done to my hair because it looks so much fuller if you have dry hair this probably wont be best for you ill definitely repurchase
11976,3.0,i am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit if youre a true xs id skip this one however if you are able to size down i think it would look really great

12009,1.0,i saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money look at the top the stripe colors are different and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well and the dress was short on me and im two inches shorter than the model bummer

12016,3.0,i really liked this dress in so many ways im tall and pearshaped so the flowy shape is great for me however the dealbreaker was how the armholes were cut it isnt that obvious in the photos but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me and it was too expensive to keep something thats unflattering too bad if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets

12093,2.0,this is the first organix product that failed to meet my expectations having loved the sea mineral shampoo and conditioner i thought id give this a try since ive been heat styling more often and my ends are a little dry after shampooing like normal i applied this from earlevel down to my ends concentrating on the ends i left it in for about minutes while i shaved my legs and scrubbed the rest of my body it isnt very thick at all and almost has the texture of just regular shampoo when i went to rinse it out it felt as though there wasnt even any product in my hair like i never applied this deep conditioner at all it was really odd after every use i really didnt notice any improvement in my hair it actually felt less hydrated than when i would use the regular sea mineral conditioner i say save your and use it to purchase the regular sea mineral conditioner instead because that stuff is pretty awesome i saw some videos on youtube about this being good for cowashing so perhaps it works well for that purpose but if youre looking for something to truly moisturize repair and deep condition this isnt it but on the bright side at least the smell is wonderful im still a fan of organix but just not this particular product

12101,4.0,very soft material probably will pill quickly but it is super comfortable it is also very low cut it works perfectly for me for breastfeeding because each of the front panels can be easily pulled to the side a cami underneath is required the model definitely isnt wearing a bra ill be wearing a nursing tank under this definitely a good print for summer

12120,3.0,this phone is good i got it at rs during this diwali sale but after using this i was bound to think on the various aspects considering the ram and rom gb and gb in this case is the price ok i felt that its really overpriced we can get more features in phones like redmi note pro which is priced at around k discounts and bank offer are separate this means we are paying for brand name or goodwill price simply to apple then why we are not going for one plus models made in china as apple i phone is also made in china for your information i have given my honest and genuine feedback now its up you to decide whether to go for this or other brand with more features but at half the price of apples i phone xr hope my review helps

12133,1.0,a corny book with cheesy linesmy parents are not such cheesy
12134,2.0,i love the ethnic colors the creative woven design of this garment thats what attracted me in the first place however some of the metallic threads had snagged i thought the loose weave acrylic yarns would lead to more snags it would eventually stretch out of shape also its very big too bad it doesnt come smaller in the online picture it must have been gathered clipped behind the model because it really doesnt fit close like that the long armholes are not visible online as
12135,2.0,battery life not good verry bad
12136,2.0,battery is good software development is very bad camera quality is bad videos not supporting for this model
12137,4.0,the fit and design are interesting in the p the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of strategy required the quality is fine but the color was very blah with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused with the lining and material weight it would be more a cold weather item only not an all seasonal dress generally it was interesting but not a most come home wit
12138,1.0,im not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake but i received the chiffon shell but there was no slip as pictured it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer i had high hopes but sadly this is being returned the xs is out of stock now so i cant even reorder bummer

12141,4.0,its picture quality is pretyy much decent though sound quality is great it is soo loud and many types of sound mode this have according to situation simply must buy this because this is a great product accprding to its price as the price of it is very low and under budget type
12142,3.0,i love this dress the only issue is i ordered online and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled once i washed it yes its washable it looked fantastic
12144,3.0,okay good
12145,5.0,i have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly i am with broad shoulders loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile jeansboots skirtsheels definitely a keeper as a petite gal this was not overly long if you have larger hips this will not hang well

12149,1.0,i own two poodles and love anything poodle print i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale but it is horrible the fit is like wearing a pillowcase it was about inches too wide on each side while the arms fit it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short wide and wrong i was in love with the print however i had to return it
12150,2.0,i tried this blouse on in the store im generally an or in this brand i got down to a size and gave up this blouse is huge all the way around the detail on the blouse is pretty but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myselfi looked ridiculous

12158,4.0,camera does its job quite wellabout ram and memory quite satisfactory within the price range software upto date and user friendlyonly disadvantage i found using this phone is the late response of the fingerprint scanner samsung has overall provided a standard phone for users in the medium ranges while eliminating the previous dubiousity of hanging of the phones quite frequently

12160,3.0,good battery laggy fingerprint scanner average camera quality good design sturdy built body to be honest the dual camera setup of the phone is a joke but then what more could you expect in that front from a k rupees phone

12164,2.0,really its frustrating with m camera such a worst result i really disappointed with samsung first time i should not now prefer to purchase samsung again overall battery is only ok not good what a standard samsung has maintain please do not purchase this mobile with identifying previously brand of samsung now samsung is also changed with competition
12165,3.0,loved this top but had to return it the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality
12166,2.0,i purchased this phone on the day of its sale when there were no reviews available i made a big mistake in trusting the brand samsung blindly this phone might have pros but they are nothing special many smaller brands also provide those features the one particular flaw that annoyed me the most and made me write this harsh review is lack of notification led light this may sound simple but what it means if your phones battery is low you wont notice any warning if you are charging your phone you dont know if its charging because there is no led light if you had a missed call no led notification if you had a text no notification you will know all these only when you turn your screen on so you turn your phone scree on regularly to check for all these how the heck did they design a product like this there are many annoying things in this phone but this one simple feature missing totally pissed me off on top to rub salt on woundsamazon cant do refunds on phones which is a revelation to me i jumped in and bought this phone in the first week and now i regret trusting samsung i already posted it on olx cant keep it my suggestion is dont rush to buy it

12170,5.0,nice phone still using it
12171,3.0,it doesnt have as good of sound quality as i thought it would for
12172,3.0,the device looks and feels amazing it definitely adds to your style and turns heads when you use the device product delivery was on time packing and boxing was at par pros the phone is awesome in terms of looks great battery life good charge time with the fast charger large screen decently bright comes with dark night mode good day lights photos firm strong and averagely heavy device pubg is smoother dual lte g cons low light photos are grainy selfies in artificial not sunlight light is grainy natural no correction or tweaking phone lags a bit initially the camera also lags while clicking and saving the image mpxls photos are nice but there is a lag or processing time required to save these photos conclusion all in all it is a decent device okay for normal users and users with lots of patience external features are awesome internals are great too but the problem of lagging and freezing persists reminds me of mega series samsung phones
12173,3.0,the phone is sleek and looks sexy however the battery life is bad using apps and the phone continuously for sometime drains out the battery really quick which is a huge draw back for a new phone secondly ios is taking up quite a lot of space therefore gb iphone is just not recommended camera is just good overall not satisfied with s gb
12174,5.0,comparing with various market available models in the same specification i opted for m the phone is excellent in terms of performance and reliability this has a good battery life and camera quality ideal mobile for personal and office use receive phone and good packing and without any damage

12183,3.0,i had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available and lets say i was swimming in the xl much to big so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg when i compare the two the lg is over inches smaller than the xl seems like quite a big jump in the sizing the suit fits in the body quite well however its a bit snug in the side bust area strangely the suit has boning on the side of the bust and also the silicone grip on the top edge
12184,4.0,quite better backup mentioned backup mah but actually it has can charge redmi y times
12185,1.0,bought it on jan first week found old files from april on the card the package looked genuine but feels something fishy with this item looks like its a knock off item or they just formated an old card and re packed the same dont buy from this sellerjanshub

12188,2.0,i liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough but the thin fabric does not justify the price it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two
12189,2.0,within in month side speaker is not working

12207,2.0,i tried a size x small on in the store and i am lbs i had trouble getting my head through the dress and once i did it felt so tight at the neck as if it was chocking me the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no i would not recommend this dress for those reasons
12208,2.0,i noticed a serious problem as soon as i took the device first in my hand it feels like the body of this device from the sidesespecially from the heights is loose or something and it makes some creepy sounds when i hold my device firmly as if the back cover fitting is not proper with the body it also feels like there is a hidden button on the sides as i get tap sound on holding the device apps are closing automatically during use please give me solution for this problems
12209,2.0,this shirt is beautiful it is flowy and light a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring however do not follow the washing instructions on the tag it says you can machine wash tumble dry low and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again if you do order please take the
12210,5.0,this is a fun thing to have i can ask for measurements when cooking what the weather is the baseball scores whatever and not have to stop and look on the internet and can finish the task i am involved in at the time
12211,1.0,product is damaged
12212,4.0,i think mi should reduce its weight power bank feels little heavy other wise the product is good this is my third purchase mi powerbank mah feels delighted
12213,5.0,theres absolutely nothing to dislike about this phone its a beauty very easy on the eyes the camera quality is superb and one of the main reasons i got the phone the fast charge is real and the battery life is also excellent theres absolutely no fault when it comes to the fingerprint reader as its fast and accurate this phone is a must have i reccomend it
12214,5.0,this sweater is so much cuter than the online picture makes it look i think the model is wearing it too large anyway this runs kind of big so size down its kind of short in the front but it hits at a nice flattering spot love it
12215,1.0,one side speaker is damaged
12216,2.0,i really wanted to love these i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap they were a little long and didnt quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine i was told they wouldnt stretch out much well they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i cant get them to shrink wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean too late to return so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans
12217,2.0,been seeing this in the shops for a while but the price put me off buying it our local supermarket had some reduced to clear so i grabbed some i am pleased that i did not pay full price as it was not a good buy used shampoo and conditioner the other night and although the shampoo felt nice to use one of the products left my hair feeling very dry i do have dry damaged fine hair and this made it worse it also made my blonde a bit yellow enough for me to notice immediately the change in colour a real shame as i had high hopes going by the reviews
12218,4.0,good speaker performs as displayed
12219,3.0,only for houseold usethis mobile is perfect
12220,3.0,i have very thick long hair i sort of like this shampoo and sort of dont as another person said it is bogus and crappy the fact that they play up on the word organic when this product is definitely not and it is more pricey that what it should be i find that irritating i do loveee the smell even if it is fake and not of essential oils partially why i went back to this shampoo the smell alone i like smells fresh and unique it does feel a little minty on my scalp when washing and that feels nice my hair is beautiful soft and shiny hydrated after using but the most annoying thing i find is that my scalp is itchy aftersoo i probably wont buy again its funny that my scalp would be itchy and have some bumps after a shampoo that has tea tree and mintsince tea tree usually helps with that type of thing so it must be the other chemicals and ingredients in this that my skin finds irritating sucks because i do like the feel of my hair after and love the smell i have used the morrocan argan oil shampoo from this brand and i like it but my hair isnt as soft as it is with the tea tree mint their kukui oil shampooconditioner i didnt like at allleft my hair dry and gross
12221,2.0,the sound is terrible
12222,1.0,i should have known i bought the coconut milk shampoo and conditioner from this line and hated it thought this might be better but no i want my conditioner to have some slip and make my hair feel well conditioned this feels so terrible and it feels like my hair is more tangled after i rinse this out never touching this line again
12223,1.0,this is worse phone i have seen ever at this price the mobile is not functioning wellover heating when using camera screen is not not well and not connect to g for both simple at a time i have complained to amazon but the response is not good and they refused to return the phone i am using amazon from years
12224,5.0,this is an sd card nothing exciting except when they dont work i suppose but this thing worked perfectly i put it in my vivotab windows device and it worked perfectly it has about gb of formatted free space on it typical but most folks expect to get to use the full gb i heartily recommend this device
12225,3.0,havent decided if im going to keep this dress yet it arrived torn at the seams but was able to use two sided tape to fix and straps were sewn on twisted in my opinion it is not worth full price i would say it runs tts im between and and a and the size sp fit perfect however the petite size runs pretty long it says inches from shoulder but i need to wear it with inch heels mine may have been a wrong size marked issue dress looks exactly as in the picture
12226,5.0,very handy
12227,5.0,pros display is awesome fluid samoled and hz refresh rate really change the experience one of the best things is charger charging speed is really impressive overall speed oneplus has been doing since great cons length mobile is very disappointing it is very large sometime gives pain in hand by reaching to other end of phone battery backup is not much by warp charger makes it faster which charge in no time after all how can we forget camera design
12228,4.0,this dress has a much more flattering fit than appears it has curves and fits tts the fabric is fairly heavy nice quality polyester and will be just the right weight for a nocal wedding the back straps nicely cover foundations so even though its open you dont need special undergarments the color in the pic is spot on dont be deceived by the turquoise moniker
12229,3.0,weve found that its really basic stuff that alexa can assist with anything beyond that you do have to pay more for not worth it bc you end up looking it up on anyway
12230,2.0,expected much more from realme i just hating this ui of realme they didnt even unlocked cameraapi feature camera is so poor
12231,3.0,i like the idea of this but had to return it the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into the shirt is too poofy didnt flatter short and curvy
12232,1.0,very pathetic battery life with moderate use also it doesnt last till eight pm in the evening from morning eight while making calls the person on other side is unable to hear my voice clearly i will not recommend this product
12233,5.0,dual sim monile from apple awesome performance
12234,4.0,m is an amazing smart phone if you want an excellent battery lifefast chargingawesome display then this phone is the perfect choice for you in this price range the thing that i dont like about this phone is that the face unlock feature and finger print scanner of this phone are not so fast and responsive but i think that samsung will resolve these issues by providing further updates camera of the phone is good but not very great
12235,3.0,using from days seems to be nice got for best pricehappy for it to hr battery back up is ok for me nice design but thing is it getting heat exactly where we kept hand across touch pad that heating problem have to fix hanging issues may be because of this heating problem or some thing else got two days delayed delivery after few followups slow power on
12236,5.0,i loved this top the cinched in waist is so flattering or ill leave it uncinched for a super relaxed fit its comfortable and light weight so ill be wearing this into late spring early summer ive worn it with the green pilcro slim pants ive worn it unbuttoned over a basic black knee length jersey dress ive worn it over a bathing suit in west palm beach i cant wait to find more fun ways to wear it
12237,5.0,i got it rs on offer picture quality was awesome sound quality is good we can a one day battery life with normal usage on a single chargei am completely satisfied with the product i love this one from apple
12238,2.0,main camera stopped working after a month apparently a known problem with iphone
12239,5.0,error
12240,4.0,over all performance and battery life is too good in that priceawsm sound quality is nice display quality is also nice but front camera is not good enough specially in indore light conditions lack of image sharpness in captured image back camera is good but portrate mode is not working properly looking like artificially blured photo its look like the depth sensor camera is only for show off or marketing purposes i hope honor will fix this camera issues by ota updates
12241,1.0,i got redmi pro months back and now i am facing a problem in such a short duration the phone keeps restarting when just switched off the phone switches on just after sec of being switched off i demand a new piece and a reply for this as soon as possible
12242,3.0,ok phone too many mi ads gets slow after months but good for calling and texting operations not useful for gaming
12243,1.0,the phone is getting switched off when we are placing a callopening google and playing video etc and the list goes onthe worst product i got so far on amazon
12244,1.0,looking very bad compare to other i phones
12245,5.0,smooth as butter no lag and awesome display with superb camerajust the perfect phone
12246,5.0,it does everything i expected and does it quite well
12247,5.0,what can i say its a memory card good price for a nice performing card id definitely buy again
12248,4.0,it is delicate and soft the sleeves fit great on my lb frame but the shoulders on the size small were too tight so i am exchanging it for a medium the lining is unusual the front is fully lined but the back is only lined to the shoulder blades which is somewhat noticeable on the model i would choose to wear a cami underneath for extra coverage
12249,4.0,battery backup is low rear camera is low quality
12250,4.0,compare to a which is upgraded good for beginners ladies aged peoples not suitable for youngsters and office peoples this is basic android budget phone dont expect more than this only one drawback is finger print missing if mi will add this feature which will be the best in market so wait for a release value for money thank you mi and amazon guyzz
12251,5.0,i do not think i could express how much i love this top it is so flattering and soft i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top it is stretchy which for me is a wonderful thing i purchased the day it came in store it is quickly prone to pilling though with the style of shirt its not so bad but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost
12252,5.0,i have this baby in my samsung note and there is not much to say except it seems to be working without a flaw
12253,2.0,this dress is cuter is person than online but it has one huge issue there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open it fell off the minute i tried to undo it i cant believe these other reviewers didnt have the same problem or maybe they put a snap there instead too bad
12254,4.0,best and activated honor band
12255,4.0,everything is good except battery it drain much faster than it is expectedawesome camera beautiful pics captured till now good sound quality and screen
12256,2.0,i have had this shirt for a little over a month ive wore it maybe times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder its not even on a seam so i cant fix it i expect much better quality from retailer dont buy this the quality is very disappointing which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts
12257,4.0,why it is written made in in china in the back of the mobile is it not the genuine one then why we should pay rs for a duplcate phone is it not from the apple kindly check and revert
12258,4.0,samsung jumping into low priced smartphones has disrupt the market for sure the phone is pretty good for its value and does the basic jobs if you run low on battery then this this the phone for you dont expect much from camera as itne mein itne ich milega
12259,1.0,i purchased the conditioner to use with the shea shampoo and used them both together and with different shampoos and each time i got the same result comparing this conditioner to the organix coconut condition the shea formula was a lot less thick i like my conditioners to be thick and creamy and this was not this product did not help smooth my hair or make it more manageable the scent was nice but i did not find that it lingered like the coconut version did not get desirable results so i will not repurchase
12260,5.0,so far so good there is no lag or heating in the phone when you play the heavy game for half an hour battery life is also decent and it will surely last for a day for normal use with some gaming activities
12261,5.0,excellent for the price very good
12262,5.0,perfect took card put old gb card and transferred it over to it in the computer while my samsung galaxy s was off then inserted it in my samsung galaxy s powered up and it was like i had never took the gb card out read ringtones programs stored on external sd card everything no errors no glitches connected the phone to the computer via usb cable and usb slot and in no time my gb of music was transferred to my phone and it all read and is working perfectly i could not be more pleased when a products works like it is supposed to
12263,5.0,i liked the understated colors of this dress so i decided to try it on i did not expect it to fit so well im with a large bust and large hips the dress was super slimming and flattering it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me the only thing id have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long but im used to that with my height the straps are positioned perfectly my bra straps didnt even show the material is very thin and light
12264,3.0,battery life very poor phone performance very poor
12265,5.0,this romper checks off all the boxes its beautiful and the fit is perfect
12266,5.0,fast data speeds large capacity and worked right off the bat in my samsung siii love the fact it holds my large music and audio books library on the device
12267,4.0,i liked the product my only thought is whether my mi could tolerate it though till now tolerating
12268,5.0,every thing good camera performance better
12269,4.0,this is one of the best sounding earphones in this price range i must say that im very much impressed by sound quality and the bass it had offered but this product doesnt last long for sure coz im using this product since months and the cable had broken at mm connectors place coz of simple bend that i did when i put my phone connected with earphones into the pocket for some days while i was walking so if u dont put ur phone in your pocket with earphones connected then it wont break for some time and if u want best sounding experience u could buy thisso i recommend this product on the basis of music quality and dont recommend on durability and reliability thank u
12270,1.0,very very worst product
12271,3.0,the fabric and color of this dress is beautiful two problems with the dress that the picture does not show its long im this model must be over feet tall as the length hit inches above my ankle and that is not a flattering length the other issue is that there is toile underneath making the skirt extra puffy im and the puffiness reminded me of prom color and fabric great but had to send back
12272,4.0,overall performance is amazing we can say beast but still missing headphone jack slot
12273,2.0,very bad mobile lost of money this my first samsung experience camera not good display black color video is not exact black team samsung youre most trusted brand like iphones please dont release this types of mobiles battery is good sound is good screen is big but i am not happy with this hope yours next update will change everything

12278,2.0,the print colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely the design is quirky to say the least i ordered a small as i usually do i am and weigh lbs this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist its not flattering at all
12279,5.0,i love this dress ive received compliments from everyone its long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school and its beautiful
12280,1.0,worst condition with amazon there is no cancellation for emi transactions the product also looking not good its so small in size
12281,1.0,a bad choice the phones audio dongle does not work with mm handsfree cables bad battery backup with dual g chips in my case with moderate usage it gave a back up of about hours only also a substantial amount of storage is consumed by the operating system and mind it it does not have the slot to provide you accessibility to a possibility of external storage sdcard also it does not support the face recognition despite recording the face dimensions and last but not the least the finger print does not work for any other user other than the administrator
12282,4.0,love tracy reese finds at retailer first day wearing this skirt and have already received a number of compliments not a typical material i would buy clothing wise but its really comfortable and not clingy as i thought it may be i appreciate the built in slip for some extra substance as well
12283,5.0,saw these in the store and had to have them i wear them rolled up they are lightweight whenever i wear them i want to smile the birds with hats are so funny i wear them to run errands have worn them when flying etc cant say enough good things about these pants they wash well no ironing needed
12284,2.0,i usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand they are lightweight sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body this brand can run big so i usually buy a size rather than my normal size i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes and because they didnt label them etc anymore these pants still look well made and have cute little details but they are bigger than ever the s
12285,5.0,i am not music guy to differentiate base and bass and eq but its my first jbl speaker i love this speakeri am connected to s working fine no issuesguranteed can get this at this price
12286,2.0,quality of xiaomi has deteriorated with increase in famewith updates it gets sluggish
12287,1.0,no clear directions on how to set up no one to call
12288,3.0,i am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big its meant to be a relaxed fit but it sagged under the armholes because the bust was way too big some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size i got on here to reorder in a smaller size but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days
12289,2.0,very low sound quality and high amount
12290,3.0,the phone mi a is good in terms of camera and finger print sensors but it is really pathetic in terms of battery life although it gets fully charged in less than an hour but it also gets drained very fast in my first couple of weeks use it was perfect but after that it is highly disappointing i fully charge my phone in the morning and leave it at my home without any use back from office after hours when i check the phone of the charge is drained off without any use as i use this phone only in my home
12291,4.0,good stuff
12292,4.0,front camera working not properly

12294,1.0,the colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it however i too noticed the delicateness of the material it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray including next to the kimonos label so sad
12295,5.0,i bought this jacket in the gray and couldnt be happier with it it is loose fitting but not oversized it will look great over a dress with boots or with jeans very versatile piece
12296,5.0,superb performance cameras are good face id sensors are awesome battery lasts for a day with heavy use loud crisp sound value for money
12297,1.0,i really wanted to like this dress the color is perfect the design and cut are cut not always the case at retailer however the fabric quality was terrible a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back
12298,4.0,this top is super cute and comfy just wish they would have made more xls ran out fast i am and usually wear an top in retailer so i purchased a large in this top to get the length and look of the model in the picture it was too short and didnt fall like the picture i tried to exchange for the xl and it was already sold out bummer was looking forward to wearing this all summer stars for running out of a size so quickly please make more
12299,3.0,i got the more bonus bottle fl oz of this the conditioner from a local supermarket for each my friends looooooove this stuff and i was curious to try it out its much thicker and more gelatinous than any shampoo that ive ever used before maybe this consistency is why it doesnt lather nearly as much as other shampoos its lightly perfumed and it smells wonderful the product promises a sleek sexy shine i have rough dry hair and it made almost no difference other than cleaning it i used both the shampoo and conditioner from this line for about weeks straight and i can say that my hair is in the same condition it was before i started using this line its mediocre and not that great but it does its job as a shampoo it didnt make my hair shinier or sleek like it said it would i bought it on impulse and because it was more than the usual bottle i may buy it again but theres better shampoos for the price considering that one normal sized bottle is pretty small and quite pricey at almost
12300,5.0,this tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts jeans work well too and during cooler seasons i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm the fit of this top is not true to size for it runs large but is flattering on the body nonetheless the stripes and miniature circular openings i noticed add beautiful detail for formal or informal events as a whole this shirt is perfect the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material
12301,3.0,its slow

12309,5.0,all are very good product
12310,3.0,i agree the light colored portion of dress is not vanilla it is more beige color i liked the dress a lot it had a flattering fit on me extremely comfortable and then i noticed the black mesh portion at top of dress it did not lay flat at the outer sides between the mesh and floral fabrics like the picture it poked out on both sides at least which suddenly made the dress look cheap and ill fitting i can guess either the mesh pattern piece was not cut correctly or it was not sewn correct

12345,5.0,if you are looking for your first dslr look no more beyond its a little beast that packs everything also if u are looking to upgrade with a tight budget this is for u i was confused between d and d d has all cross type autofocus points as compared to with single cross type well that looks like a big difference and is a big difference if you are going for high speed action like sports or vigorously moving wild life photos and thats it no other significant difference if u are a family landscape macro type of photographer points is more than enough as this camera is superfast and efficient in focussing with those points now if u want wild life also like me this camera can do well with its point but if you require tracking the fast moving subject switch to live view and see the magic this camera has dual pixel cmos autofocus which is lightning fast and smooth in focussing and tracking in live view as of now d with single kit lens and d with kit lens are priced almost same but the big difference for me was the mm is stm kit lens that comes with d its the newer version stm lens not the older is ii that will cost approx rs to buy it seperately hands on impressions cons point autofocus mini usb port not micro no usb charging cant use powerbank you have to take out battery and charge with charger provided pros light weight and compact crisp images with mega pixels guided menu good battery life fast and smooth focussing variangle lcd with touch to focus works awesome wifi image transfer and remote live view shooting with smartphone you can use touch to focus and change camera settings with smatphone many shooting modes including creative modes full hd fps video timelapse mode

12351,2.0,a good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes i mix them with my basics scarves and jewelry so i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses even though i felt it was pretty pricey when it arrived i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric it does nothing for any of my intended clothes so it is going back asap

12355,3.0,the top is a pretty and has a nice pattern it does run large and is it a bit billowy i am petite and ordered a small maybe the xs would have been better however the top swallowed me up and was unflattering the colors are true to the picturenot very bright but would be a nice transition to fall top the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better

12368,2.0,i disliked this dress it didnt fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured i think it would work well for tall thin women with a smaller chest i am petite with a larger chest and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time not recommended for petite women
12369,3.0,i like this shirt its quite lovely i ordered it in mint its nice to have a dressy tshirt
12370,2.0,to be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down
12371,3.0,in the photo this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing i am always take a size medium but on me the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didnt fit properly the collar doesnt fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly if you try to use the button it stretches and looks terrible in the back it falls short its going back

12390,5.0,this is my th iphone x purchase all in used in family and bought first on launch day in india and last one in october but still and i have bought and used oneplus to pixel xl along the period and while both those phone are good but i am percent you wont enjoy them and they wont last and work as smooth as iphone x i bought this phone from k on launch till k in prime day sale after all discounts and i can say at its awesome buy i find the display best even better than smasung due to natural colours samsung phone are very oversaturated even though they also use samsung display a thing you realise when you send someone a pic before buying something and when you reach they realise color look nothing like on there phone battery is good for me screen on time but never enough but still its good compared to competition this phone is made of glass hence i use skin and a case and i still prefer glass as i enjoy wireless charging its the most premium looking peace of tech i own this phone keeps getting faster with every update something no android can compete with i will suggest you buy airpods along with the phone an awesome experience together xr is also good buy if you value camera over display
12391,5.0,amazing picture quality and sound qualityvalue for money deal smart tv make my life easy

12396,4.0,xr is great but im facing problem in screenshot capture from past one monthrest all ok
12397,3.0,however phone is good but many of the key features of mi phones are missing like call recording etc
12398,3.0,there is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip instead it has an elastic waist it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist i am and a size it runs a bit large i think this is due to the elastic waste
12399,1.0,the material is thin and of poor quality it snagged the first time i wore it the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated
12400,3.0,as other reviewers have noted this is a pretty top i really love the design alas however it is too big for my frame for reference i am barely and about lbs i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp i am going to have to part with it sadly
12401,2.0,so the problem is basically with its gpu unit it turns off automatically somehow i am still trying to figure out what is wrong and there is nothing wrong actually it is commanded by asus to save battery life and you have to restart the laptop to turn on the gpu agan that is so very annoying and you cant do anything about this problem but the thing is sometimes gpu shuts down in minutes of restart very disapointed with this purchase it only gives me fps and gpu shuts down in between games and you have to again restart the laptop and gpu again will somehow shut down after no significant period of time poor product from asus i am so mad puchasing this product dont ever go for it take my words for it thank you asus ps nothing is wrong with amazoon here their delivery product handling was great it was twodaydelivery and product is genune so hats off to amazon for taking good care of products and i hope this review gets some attention from amazon customer service team as well
12402,1.0,please dont buy this band does not work and shows blank screen if you update the firmware
12403,5.0,book
12404,5.0,i love the product
12405,3.0,i didnt like the sound quality also the earplug keeps coming out of my ears not my choice
12406,3.0,failed after one month and the problem is epidemic on the sandisk forums they slowly get corrupted then fail and report only mb sizethe lifetime warranty is nice but these products are clearly defective im in the process of rma now will update post on status updatesdo not trust your data with this product keep a backup of everything you put on it im serious just look at the sandisk users forum for gb cardshere is my breakdown while it lastedsandisk ultra gb microsdxc class uhswrite speed was mbs usually tested windows usb reader and androidread speed mbsfailed monthsupdate received back replacement item in brand new condition readspeed is mbs write speed is still around mbs rma turn around time was about weeks i will up rating if this one lasts longer then one monthupdate rma replacement is still going strong upped the star rating by one point
12407,3.0,pretty top i like the flutter sleeve design the linen is thin too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white nice for the sale price can easily be dressed up or down
12408,2.0,i dont like it at all it smells bad and its not smoothing its kind of gunky the scent stays all night i can smell it in the morning or hours after shower sorry no one likes this review but thats my opinion it sucks
12409,4.0,i bought these in my standard on sale woop they are super comfortable with a bit of stretch for those days when you need a little extra room the ankles are easily cuffed and look great with ankle boots my only qualm is that they run a bit big and tend to gape in the back i love a higher rise jean and these are a great option but id lean towards sizing down
12410,4.0,v good one
12411,2.0,it gives you info through wikepedia go for google as google has much larger dat base
12412,5.0,i got this for my new android tablet and it works perfectly the microsd to sd adapter is great it allows me to plug it into my computer into the regular sized sd card port to transfer files much quicker than if i were to plug the tablet into my computer over usb
12413,1.0,i am a genuine buyer of this phone and really astonished to see so many good reviews of this phone i had to sell it one week later at a loss of k on cashify firstly i dont like that yellowish tint on screen which all samsung phones have this one too has it the camera quality is the real disappointment specially in indoor lights they have failed to develop proper algo to interlace the pics from cameras properly oppo and vivo phones in same range offer mp camera and have much better picture quality processor is also not satisfying its some old age one playing pubg with reduced graphics is the only option finger sensor is inferior to other same range phones though it takes sec to open the phone but practically sec is quite annoying others do it much faster amazon did not give any option to return it within days and neither was i allowed to post any review earlier so posting it now after months of its launch good things battery life is really great it lasts for at least days screen resolution and picture quality is very good lookwise it is a decent one
12414,3.0,i am tall and typically wear a size so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a coverup than a tunic it fits like a poncho with my arms at my sides it fit me similar to the model picture but if i lift my arms to use them then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me the reason for that is that it doesnt really have sleeves its more like hol
12415,4.0,cute top good color fabric is a little rough and scratchy
12416,5.0,battery bot good as expected
12417,4.0,i got this for a friend and they love love love it
12418,4.0,this comes in a jar which makes it difficult for me to use in the shower but it works well on my hair while it is not the most moisturizing deep treatment i have used it does give my hair definition and softens without leaving my hair too frizzy it has the consistency of pudding and is yellow in color i have used the original macadamia mask and that one is much better than the organix for moisturizing abilities but the organix version is better suited for those with finemedium hair textures and will provide more volume it does have a protein in it so if you are protein sensitive than skip this one if you like organix products in general this one is nice to use and it has a decent smell i allow it to sit in my hair while in the shower for minutes and then i rinse it out it leaves no residue and my hair doesnt look dull once it airdries i think i paid less than dollars for mine at cvs though i would wait for when it comes on sale
12419,5.0,didnt receive memory card
12420,4.0,wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater
12421,4.0,excellent product from xiaomi perfectly designed with quick charge facility a must buy power bank giving stars just because they didnt provide type c cable in the box
12422,3.0,i kept this one because it was different enough and good to wear casually and to work im not sure how this material will hold up with washing since its basically a thin cotton material it fits perfectly so im worried that it will shrink i give it a thumbs up for the design but sale cost and material is like something you would find at forever

12426,4.0,i got these in kelly green because i am tired of all of the black and navy in my wardrobe and i was not disappointed the pants are welldesigned and drape well unlike a previous reviewer i did not find the fabric to be cheap but it is light and a little blousynot bad for a warm region like mine this polyester fabric has two advantages no fading and no wrinkles a good staple for work
12427,2.0,all okkk it doesnt not support miui and its notch is not fuly works on all app the smartphone without notch is also similar like it dont waste ur money

12438,4.0,i bought this in a gif sale worth buying and suit for one person it cools within minutes deep freeze block is little bit small and doors are delicate go for big one with additional k
12439,5.0,the fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering it doesnt stick out too far over the butt the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights im usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one
12440,1.0,the only reason i threw this out instead of returning it was that i had a try me free offer on it it certainly isnt worth anything more than free no hold at all and oddly drying despite the moisturizing coconut milk foams like shampoo and one of the ingredients coco betaine is indeed found as a cleanser in many shampoos i also get weird kinky frizzies with this and it is very heavy the coconut milk and makes my hair oddly flat at the roots but the ends got very frizzy and dry
12441,4.0,absolutely love this day starts and ends with echo dot fully recommended

12448,4.0,ordered this in the whitegray likely one of the softest tops i own and drapes beautifully density of fabric enough that i wont need a tee underneath design of the pointed front will look great with a shorter jacket im busty and there is a ton of fabric in the front due to shipping i wont return but could have gone a size down and im a dd
12449,3.0,i was hoping to love this tunic but it isnt what i was hoping for the material is cute but the piece itself is a little too baggy and just doesnt do anything for my shape just made me look boxy all around it felt more like a poncho than a tailored tunic unfortunately it has to go back
12450,1.0,my phone has mah battery and it charge only for times by this product
12451,5.0,mast phone hh

12458,4.0,spekar in back of the phone i dont like but battery cameraface recognition was good
12459,3.0,i think the model is wearing a larger size per the first review i am and lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous so you should order up if that is what you want this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it
12460,2.0,again a poor performing phone compared to other brand battery back up is alo poor
12461,1.0,simply useless product i have received a hand set and unable to switch on the product i have contacted the customer support but there is no response from them if the case is not handled immediately i will raise the issue to consumer forum

12473,2.0,after the second wash the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart after sewing it back up wearing it and washing it a third time the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well not sure if this was just a fluke but it was very disappointing now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact i must say that this is a great dress i would have returned the dress to retailer but ive already washed and worn it so againvery disappointing i would say

12486,2.0,im c and lbs i ordered the size p and while the color and fabric is pretty the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps it was also very tight across my ribs despite ordering a petite the hem was much too long i ended up returning it
12487,3.0,seal seems to be broken before i did not recieve a fresh product battery is draining fast camera very poor body and ui is very good

12489,2.0,this is a very pretty sweater a bit boxy and short but cute i am and ordered the regular xs in black the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace i would have kept this if it was plain black lace just did not like that look
12490,5.0,i am a nokia phone user so far i have purchased this phone last week the phone is looking great on design but its plastic body benifit is less heat emitting batry performance is quite super long time fringer print readers is very active and fast predicting one face recognizing is not good it cant recognize on dim light but it can fastly recognize in day light and front clear viewcamera is very natural no color enhancement so i was beaten when i compared photos taken with my friends phone even its mp but first natural photographer will praise it for photo detail in it game performance is unbelievable unbeatable my friends look with jawdropping experience fast performance even opening so much apps downloading at a time happy to have this phone i suggest this phone for my friends four of them are buying it after using my phone ms great experience am sharing from my own experience thank you guys
12491,3.0,the water bottle storage is single only the noise is continuously coming sometimes hammer strucking noise coming out overall the performance is good and storage is large only issue is noisy
12492,1.0,mi fit app and mi band does not sync automatically so data doesnt get captured and missed there is always a doubt in mind that the product wont last long because of concurrent and relapsing one issue after the other
12493,2.0,i love these pants bought them in both black and burgundy but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning they werent even tight so disappointing i will be returning them
12494,5.0,amazing product sound quality is good
12495,2.0,this blouse is quite stiff i wouldnt mind the boxiness if this blouse werent so long even if you size down because of the eyelet and the cute hem it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit
12496,3.0,for the money its not worth hardware is good it closes apps on its own not worth for the money ive been using it for past one month
12497,4.0,the detail on this dress is lovely its unusual and wellmade from soft fabric it is big though i would usually wear a medium and ordered a petite small to give you a sense of how large it is i am currently weeks pregnant and bought this to wear after the pregnancy i can actually get it on now over the considerable baby bump it doesnt look good but i can in fact get it on hoping it wont be way too large postpregnancy but it seems to fit fine in the shoulders now definitely

12502,2.0,i have very dry frizzprone damaged looking hair it is also quite thin so i was looking for a product that would help condition my hair and help cope with bad hair days unfortunately this only seemed to work for me in the initial few applications after which it did nothing for my hair it smells good but thats not what conditioners are meant for left my hair feeling rather dry and dull could be just the way my hair is and might need more work overall would not re purchase once im through with my current supply rather disappointing
12503,2.0,first of all this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture very flattering i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering that being said it runs small i purchased a large which is my usual size and i need another inch or two all over to make it work part of the problem is the material it is a very heavy durable upholstery like material there is absolutely no give to this it is a very stiff material as well more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt the skirt c
12504,5.0,nice product worth buying
12505,1.0,battery life is very very wurst pls dont buy this mobile waste of mono it is hanging initially itself i used only days further i cant use it
12506,5.0,its hard to believe they can cram gigs of memory into a device this tiny and also get good speed out of file transfers to and from it its a good thing it comes with an adapter for larger size devicesi recommend keeping it in that adapter at all times unless its inside something like a cell phone which only takes the microsd size its way too easy to lose something this small i hate the industrys mad rush to make everything smaller and smaller with no regard to usability anyway the memory card is great outside of that and since my phone does take microsd i just keep it plugged in at all times and dont have to worry about it
12507,5.0,very nice
12508,5.0,im glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one i bought this in a medium usually wear a and it fit perfectly the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeanspantsshorts the lace detail is just gorgeous the bottom flows more loosely but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans
12509,3.0,all thing is ok battery drain fast and take more than hrs to charge full battery
12510,5.0,love being able to play any music i want to whenever i want to
12511,3.0,this products is awesome but i have found a one fault in this product this product is heating too much during the charging and charging adapters also if you try touch mobile to your chick after the charging your chick will be burn
12512,4.0,book is concise and good but most of the content in polity and economy section is not covered
12513,3.0,i was really looking forward to getting this dress in the orange print but when i finally received i was a little disappointed the print placement is not the same as shown on the model so it doesnt look as a vibrant and colorful my version of the dress has more of that muddy dark print and hardly any orange or turquoise also the backside of the print is white and the dress is not lined i do like the way it drapes on my body and the overall styling the dress fits nicely in size medium on
12514,4.0,liked it but overtime the strap becomes loose and the display accidentally falls downwithin one month
12515,2.0,like some other reviewers i too have to comment on the dresss fit the dress doesnt fit right around the bust or the waist as a seamstress myself i know that the problem is that it doesnt have any darts in the bust and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right while a belt helps i dont think it helps enough to justify the price its too badi think the concept of it is cool and i was rea
12516,5.0,well this is a really great device for home if you want to listen songs or just want some information etc
12517,1.0,i have been continually disappointed in retailers clothing for the past year i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained soso but dresses like these somehow make the cut it does not make sense since when did retailer exclusively market to older women no retailers market has always been young adults this dress is extremely matronly although the bottom print is nice the hot pink belt is completely mismatched and gaudy i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
12518,5.0,quite satisfactory
12519,4.0,reading this book made me realize how blessed we are to have a life the way it is and i pay a tribute to all those who have their struggling extent towards it
12520,5.0,i have use so many powers banks but was still working is their is a problem it is tooo much weight their all but the works also like that it also a year i face a problem with use slot one not work even then the second one is working good most it is like a fast charge to my mobile it will take with in min the power take apne whole night to full its bettery
12521,3.0,this dress is very pretty in person it fits true to size and is very figure flattering one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage my only gripe with this dress is that its a little rough and stiff feeling i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft it probably works for most people but not for me so had to go back
12522,3.0,love the blue color and the bit of sparkle gives this otherwise casual piece a bit of flair the hem is cool love the big cuffs but i looked like the liberty bell in the small it is huge through the hips not at all like on th model i also worried it would shrink and i would lose the length in the arms returned
12523,4.0,i like all the things like camera screen processor but battery drainage is an big concern otherwise its an best smartphone in this sagement on this price
12524,4.0,performance is up to the mark and is best for the budget range
12525,3.0,product decent but the quality is very cheap but packaging was very bad i received open packet of the bluetooth headset
12526,4.0,product quality is really good and it has good bass i got this at as offer was there and boat is a brand so go for it
12527,4.0,power bank battery life is very dispointed company show power bank capacity is mah but you can use power bank mah only
12528,3.0,good phone at this price i got it inr after all discount battery screen camera it is not really mp it seems like around mp touch response and performance
12529,2.0,i want to return this product because i was not aware that there is no bluetooth and music in this phonei want to purchase other phone with bluetooth and music function
12530,1.0,phone getting restarted on its own camera getting hanged very frequently wifi reception is also very poor
12531,4.0,nice picture quality and smart features are amazing however keyboard thru remote is hard to use
12532,1.0,pages not available from
12533,2.0,i wanted to love this sweater the color is gorgeous the pattern unusual it is soft and warm and would have gone with so many things but the cut is awful mainly the sleeves are way too big making me look misshapen and my arms look huge the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal too bad
12534,3.0,i love this shirt i wore it once and it is so cute on the problem came from washing i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesnt happen again
12535,3.0,battery life little less connector is not good didnt connect properly after some time
12536,5.0,definitely needed more memory for my phone this is plenty of storage and was purchased at a very affordable price
12537,3.0,i am a bit neutral on this as i had a lot of issues getting this to work lucky that i bought it when amazon had a sale on them or i would have returned it ithe speaker system on them is pretty poor so if your going to listen to music you are going to want to have some other speakers set up for italexas does not respond as well as i hoped even with it sitting right next to me i bought it just for the novelty of having it and thought the grandkids would enjoy it but frankly i have more fun and faster response when i simply ask siri on my iphonefrom the other reviews i see most people seem to like it and are happy with it maybe it is just me and i am to picky but i would never suggest that someone buy the echo dot but would suggest they buy the big full sized one instead of this
12538,4.0,i do not know if this item is worth the full price but i love it very soft good length and comfortable to wear the stripes are a perfect width so as not to be overpowering the fabric design is unique and i think the weave added to the cost of production for many it may not be worth the cost but i am glad i purchased this top it is not a sheer fabric try it on if you see it in the store
12539,2.0,received this in the mail today and was disappointed i typically wear a but bought this in the as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an this does not fit the same at all the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body needless to say i will be returning this item
12540,3.0,it is ok price is high
12541,3.0,still cant decide if i want to keep this its super comfortable but much thinner than expected and the color seems more navy blue than black
12542,3.0,ive had this card for about a year and ive been very careful with it and it just broke when i popped it out of sd card slot on my phone but it was very reliable card when it wasnt broken
12543,5.0,good product user friendly
12544,4.0,no comments
12545,5.0,other than a few for cell phones over the years this is the first time ive used microsd cards in an actual camera im very impressed it seems to be just as fast durable and dependable as the full sized cards that ive been using for years amazing
12546,3.0,this is a great card the fps with this card were incredible i ended up needing more memory so i bought the sandisk gb card
12547,5.0,amazing phone the battery life of this phone is simply amazing

12554,3.0,after using for days i find that battery is really monsterfingerprint sensor is also good but the camera quality is not as expected from samsung in day lights photo quality is good but the camera takes time to focus on objectmany times the photos look overexposed even in sufficient light conditionsalso the photo in low light conditions are also not very impressivethey show good amount of noise and haze on photo in dim lightcamera quality could have been improved in this range of pricescreen is super amoled and phone has dolby atmos sound that is in use only when you use your headphonesfront camera quality should have been more efficientother brands in the same price range are providing super efficient camera qualityone more problem that i have found in this phone is that it has issues with network connectionson comparing with my previous phone and other mobile phones of my house with different brands i found that this product has a problem of limited network access which results in poor internet speed
12555,2.0,perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts or the cut of this was not right for me but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didnt lay right on me sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned i am lbs c curvymuscular frame and ordered a size small
12556,4.0,excellent front camera i have ordered gb gb model on first sell but the product was faulty and i have raised request on amazon for replacement for the phone they had replace the phone within hrs now the phone is working fine overall specifications camera and build quality is very good in this phone special thanks to amazon
12557,1.0,ph is switching off itself its very disturbing while someone talking over ph and disconnected very poor service

12565,3.0,there are better phones for the same price try oppo
12566,4.0,i use this conditioner and the the shampoo to wash my coppola keratin treated hair whenever i find it on sale i stock up as the bottles are small and i run out quickly and thats why im only giving stars overall the smell is very nice almost chocolatey i also like the keratin oil that they sell and add it to the conditioner ive been using this product for at least a year and will continue to do so
12567,1.0,not at all worth the money it take mins for this laptop to boot up plus the mouse pad doesnt work properly had click multiple times for one click very dissatisfing and frustrating will not recommend to anyone
12568,4.0,i am currently searching for the perfect pair of white boots to go with this this is so fun i used to wear a lot of vintage clothes and this dress lit the fire again to start looking for cool pieces i tried on my usual size and found that it fit pretty tts it was a bit roomy in the hips but considering the cut of the dress i assume that to be intentional for reference i am lbs d and bought a size
12569,4.0,positive viewfridge is too exillent and colour or body is very shine full electricity consumption is also good unit per year under space is very good large frost free value of money negitive view upper door main freezer no light function in amazon website freeze photo one item unmached against actual freeze on upper door freezer hook is miss no led light or light is very dim delivery is late delivery person no help to take safely your freeze at your door gove only ground delivery
12570,1.0,first time i used iphone after using phones of nokia lenevo and micromax i can clearly see that apart from status symbol and good camera there is nothing in iphone operating system is a piece of crap phone get hang in just extra application if i still all my apps may be the phone can go in comma
12571,4.0,this blouse is a great transitional piece as other reviewers have noted the sleeves are split and thats the only reason why it gets four stars instead of five i wore it with a sleeve black top underneath to eliminate this issue for the cooler months overall design is good and the print is classy and creative this will be a lovelyt goto blouse to wear with denim fits the budget too
12572,2.0,not worth buying ram gb claim actual available only gb camera quality mp mp same no much difference camera sensor and fingerprint sensor very good purchased pearl white not so attractive color gb storage actual available gb only
12573,1.0,please dont buy this product its lagging too much battery backup is too low build quality is average think before purchasing this product
12574,5.0,when i saw this on a model at my retailer store i fell for it i love the colors and the weave of this kimono it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular it will be useful for cooler days and nights or airconditionied places the knit cuffs hold it in place i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it

12576,1.0,i am not in love with this top and will be returning it from the front it looks like a basic tee which i expected but the back x is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesnt look like an x as the picture shows so basically the focal point of the tee falls short
12577,5.0,i saw this online and thought the idea was super cute but was not sure if it would be worth the money because it looks typical but when i went to the store to try it on i saw it was anything but typical the fit is perfect and the fabric so soft i wanted the dress in the green but they were already sold out in my size at the store so i had to order it online i cannot wait until it comes in i will wear this often during the summer

12586,3.0,i love the color mustard and design of this shirt however the description says its made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that its actually made of modal which is a big difference to me i also think it runs small i ordered a medium c but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model finally the modal fabric is quite thin and i dont imagine itll last too long without tearing ill probably keep it because i l
12587,5.0,i was a little nervous to purchase this top as there were no previous reviews but it intrigued me especially with the sale price i love it i am and got the small it hits just atbelow my knee in the front and a few inches above my ankle in the back it is perfect with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings what makes it go from a frumpy tunic to a cute flowy top is the slits up the side a beautiful touch the neck is very high almost a cross between a turtle neck and a hooded look i l
12588,3.0,this dress isnt as fitted as it looks on the model it appear to be more of a shift dress as gorgeous as the print and quality are it doesnt look great on me for reference im lbs and bought xs for whatever reason the high neckline isnt flattering on me i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders

12592,3.0,i bought another copy of same book after a week and the price was low they are asking more price
12593,3.0,finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my apparently giant hulk arms but its so flowyswingy i had to return it this might just be a problem with being a larger lady but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look x bigger than i was around my waisthips even when balanced out with leggings i thought about trying to size down but wasnt sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms of course i cant try

12599,3.0,it doesnt work with our dish joey
12600,4.0,i bought this during the off and im glad i did the sweater does run large so i would recommend sizing down im lbs with a larger bust d and even the size small is large on me not large enough to exchange but i would probably do better with an xs even with an xs i would still get that oversized look the color is not exactly as pictured it is a brighter yellow in person i was expecting more of a muted soft baby yellow and thats not exactly what this is some pros a

12604,2.0,phone is buttery smoothfast app loading no crash but while surfing net is very slow on either wifi or mobile data web pages open very slowslow streaming videos on youtube i dont know only if my device is having this issue or amazon has shipped me a refurbished one in name of new one
12605,4.0,im a sucker for plaid i tried another plaid shirtdress from retailer and it looked like a housecoat on me this is lovely a bit fitted but very relaxed and casual ill be able to dress it up for casual days at work its got enough lovely details to be stylish i think the waist looks a bit simple so a belt helps dress it up the sleeves finish with a button so it looks polished or they can be rolled up i love it with booties

12610,2.0,runs very large ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller
12611,2.0,i bought this shampoo looking for a tingling shampoo it doesnt tingle it doesnt make my soft or shiny it actually dried my hair out since i have oily hair that isnt necessarily a bad thing but it wasnt what i was expecting since the product says quotmoisturizingquot in the title it smells good but the scent doesnt last long at all after i get out of the shower the smell is all but gone

12617,5.0,these are such a great alternative to actual leather pants they have the perfect amount of stretch and breathability ive always found leather pants to be too hot got the holly color unfortunately the p size was sold out but as another reviewer noted these are easy to roll up i noticed some of the complaints about quality and these not holding up but given the use of two different materials pu and a stretchy material i think its only natural that these would tear along the seams aft
12618,2.0,i did not like this top at allbut had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have it is polyesteri thought it was cotton so theres the first reason i didnt like it secondly there is a piece of fabric behind the laces presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat it wrinkles up behind the lacing making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top it is too long for me the top hitting at top of thigh this top is just reall

12623,3.0,im still on the fence about these i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker they just feel too flimsy and too much like im ready for bed i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasnt wearing pjs i just cant get past that they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer loungewear i ordered the small which fit fine i wear in retailer pants i got the p

12637,2.0,camera quality is very very poor size of the body is big not a thin it should be very thin easy to handle
12638,4.0,i really like this shirt the design and colors are very good i ordered the black one with cats it was cool however in general i dont like highlow tops because they dont look flattering and you can see that it is asymmetrical from the front makes it awkward the shirts design doesnt make the highlow aspect stand out much which is great but it is a tad shorter than i would like in the front it is also loose fitting it is perfect for a slimmer frame but on my curvy figure it just wa

12648,4.0,im normally an xl but i bought a l since so many said it was big and boxy the l fit great its tailored to the body but not tightfitting just as shown on the model the detailing at the shoulders is heavy compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee so it pulls the neckline forward a bit i bought the red and wow its a bright fireengine red thats just stunning it looks lighter in the photo it arrived all squished up in a little tiny roll so it was really wrinkled
12649,2.0,sleeves were tight was difficult to put on for the price you want to love the shirt sending it back
12650,4.0,yes this runs big but i sized down from med to small and it works i like the graywhite pattern received compliments upon first wearing and know ill wear it often i knocked off a star because of the rayon fabric which wrinkles so easily this top always looks rumpled in the back from sitting still im glad to have it in my fall wardrobe

12656,2.0,not worth
12657,4.0,its been days since i started using the mi band the pros and cons based on this brief usage are as follows pros light weight it doesnt even feel like wearing something on my wrist good battery i charge it every days but it drains quicker because i frequently track my workouts with just basic usage it will easily last for days step and workout tracking both are very accurate during workout it mentions your speed and heartbeat after every km looks cool i guess it positioning of heartbeat tracker does put some limitations on the size of band still designers have done a commendable job and made sure that it looks good on your wrist google fit the data sync with google fit data cons inaccuracy in sleep tracking while tracker is accurate in measuring in sleep duration i doubt that it reports the correct data regarding sleep phases moreover i dont understand how the sleep score in calculated i got more score while sleeping hours than sleeping hours this part needs a great deal of improvement heartbeat tracker unless set to track heartbeat continuously heartbeat tracking happens only during workouts and setting for continuous heartbeat tracking drains the battery very fast i will update this review in the future

12661,5.0,perfect balance of bass and terrible no headphone can match the performance of this headphone under rs price bracketyou just have to compromise on the wire quality otherwise best headphone for its price
12662,4.0,this top is a departure from my usual style but i had to give it a try because it looked so comfy yet structured i wish the material was less sheer as i have to wear a cami underneath when i wear it to work im lb and the fits just fine
12663,4.0,ordered the xsp about athletic buildthis was huge all over big in the armholes too much fabric hanging in the skirt cream fabric front and back not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model i love the idea of this and for the right body type of course this will be beautiful it also would not be a very versatile piece for methe top sweater part is quite thick lovely and heavy in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks
12664,4.0,camera quality not up to mark

12669,4.0,good book can be better if they correct the errors has around of misleading errors
12670,3.0,i love the organix brand overall i decided to try this new product of theirs because i get severe split ends and i was interested in keratin treatment this shampoo has a light pleasant but unidentifiable sent it does not create much lather but thats typical of shampoos that try to use more natural ingredients and less sulphates i did not like that it left an oily residue on my skin that was difficult to wash off afterwards it was a passable cleaner for my hair but i will be going back to one of my old favorites because after several weeks of use i did not see a noticable difference in the reduction of split ends or breakage
12671,2.0,so bummed i was really hoping this top would work for me i got the black in regular size and the pink in petite size both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section i have a sort of short torso wear a small c and am have a defined waist when tops are bulky it gives me no shape and just looks terrible i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out the constr

12674,1.0,very bad experience with samsung again with the smart phones its totally unexpectable experience i have purchased this phone in mid february and its mid august now and phone screen got damaged without any physical contact screen is not working properly have asked the problem to samsung care but the solutions they have suggested is not fulfill my expectations they have suggested to visit samsung care stores for the same and i am sure after visiting there the store guy will ask you for the high money for the replacement and all and they will blames to the customers only i dont know why samsung is making smart phones if they cant make a good one i would like to request kindly return my phone please i dont want this any more now
12675,3.0,this top is cute i purchased a instead of my usual size and it fits well i only recommend buying this top on sale it is not good quality there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through it is totally nuts that it costs
12676,2.0,i love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite i am just under feet tall and usually wear a p in this brand this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me i returned this dress
12677,4.0,i recently purchased as of no drawbacjs
12678,5.0,love this sweater it fits true to size fun and different purchased off but i dont think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget

12682,4.0,nice refrigerator for small faimly
12683,1.0,terrible conditioner for the price i paid i have short hair thats pretty easy to deal with and most hair products work pretty much the same for me but this is a total let down despite the fact that it smells awesome it just doesnt do what a conditioners suppose to do i would apply this like any other conditioner and when its time to wash it off it feels like the conditioners all gone the tangles are still there and my hair actually feels a little oily not silky as it promised at all right now im just trying to use it up with its matching shampoo id say if you are like me and only intrigued by the scent just go for the shampoo and skip the awful conditioner

12687,1.0,i ordered this dress in the green color the dress did not look like the picture i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance i returned the dress
12688,3.0,i wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the dealbreaking design flaw the extremely tight sleeves even if you have stickthin arms i dont know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it sadly for me this was a no go
12689,3.0,so despite reviewers saying this was too short i decided to try it anyways the dress is adorable the print t g e pockets so cute but the description is incorrect the petite falls from shoulder which means its right under your bum so you move anyway and someone gets a show its unfortunate because this dress is adorable it would fit tts except length unfortunately this one has to go back

12694,1.0,very bad service from amazon the ear phone is missing from the box and looks like the phone is preety old cos it stated heated up immediately upon switching on
12695,3.0,the big disadvantage of the product is that there is no front flash other things are good like battery life full display and touch etc
12696,2.0,i was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture but i had wishful thinking i should have gone with my gut this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases it is seethrough and flimsy the bottom is just like the picture it hangs in an odd rumpled way the top is very flattering though so its a shame if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
12697,1.0,product is not good as expected and the charger in this box i have received is volt in the place of volt this is very very bad experience with amazon
12698,3.0,doesnt fit as tightas slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight
12699,4.0,such a pretty dress and the colors are just so summery its very flattering on but i will have to return it unfortunately i ordered the p because the p was sold out and although the top fits quite well its just too snug on the hips if the p was available i would definitely exchange it for that
12700,2.0,generally the appeal of organic conditioners is that they dont contain silicones which snap my baby fine hair like a twig sadly this product does contain silicones and does nothing for my easily tangled hair ive learned when using avalon conditioners that with organic products you need to leave it on longer in order for it to work i left it on for probably minutes and my hair was still a tangled snarly mess ive been using my leftovers to shave my legs as that seems to be the best use of it as far as price its cheap for an organic conditioner and ive learned that you get what you pay for apparently
12701,3.0,the sound and build quality is good but after using it for months the charging stop working only to know later that it is the most common fault of jbl flip it could be of most jbl speakers i am not sure just guessing
12702,1.0,i agree with the other reviewers this top is completely disappointing in every way i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag where to begin it runs really big its short and boxy not at all like it appears on the model this must be pinned a lot in this picture colors are completely dull in person i really think this picture was lightened a great deal fabric feels cheap and stiff lining is stuff and poorly sewn i havent one positive thing to say about t

12704,2.0,i got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas it looked adorable and long on the model however it doesnt even cover my butt thats how short it is if youre anything over id say itll be too short for leggings
12705,1.0,star for the phone but star for amazon delivery and customer service
12706,4.0,i am addicted to these dresses as usual the detail is amazing and the shape is so flattering as some reviewers mentioned the dress is much more brown than shown on the picture so if youre looking for a black dress there are others in the collection that are much better otherwise gorgeous dress

12713,5.0,this was my first fitness tracker initially i was planning to buy mi band but ended up buying this as it seems to have many features happy with its performance though i am not sure if i should be happy with its battery it works for approx days all functions enabled with new software update now i can play and control music too
12714,1.0,it just sucks its been months from then onwards i would have spended almost bucks for just batteries to power remote the remote drains the battery within days completely but i works fine with the firetv application fix the bug asap or provide any update to reduce the battery consumption in nd generation firetv stick
12715,1.0,its been now around months now since i am using this tv and honestly it is not what i expected it to be pretty soon since i bought this tv youtube app stopped working as it needed the app update however their os does not support new update of the app and on top of it they have no way to update their os so it kinda went in loop and now its been months and i am unable to play youtube and its not only the case with youtube its with all the other apps as well thank god other apps are still running on their old versions but the moment those old versions will stop working when updating the apps will be a mandate its gonna be a complete mess another drawback is it does not support the high end internet connection so if you are running a high end internet connection this tv wont even detect your wifi i tried to call th customer service couple of times and all they tell you is that it will be fixed automatically and there is nothing which i need to do and now its been over months and its a the same buying this tv was a complete waste i will not recommend this tv at all infact any model of tv from this company it would be better if someone spends a little more and buy some quality product

12841,2.0,this is the second time ive purchased a set of products from organix after the first set of products i bought from the moroccan argan oil line absolutely bombed for me this was me giving organix a second chance after at least years i purchased most of the sea mineral moisture system in hopes of turning slowing down the sudden hair splitting i was experiencing i was due for a trim but ive never had split ends like this until after i switched off of the tresemme keratin smooth system i had been using for years i was sold on the incredible alcoholic mixeddrink smell of the sea mineral moisture products but unfortunately thats only one of good points for this shampoo my boyfriend also commented that my hair was soft and touchable again but i noticed that my split ends were worsening throughout the use of this product additionally i had the same problem with this system that steered me away from organix in the first placethe bottles come with oz of product which i had used up in about months compared to the months my shampoos tend to last this shampoo would clarify my hair and scalp so well too that it would leave my strands feeling squeaky dryin the shower so i would use a handful of conditioner at a time to remedy the dryness and found that the deep conditioner from this same line was more effective than the regular conditioner though i interchanged both throughout the months i used the system and still didnt quite have the split end issue resolved i love that this shampoo smelled amazing and cleaned my hair especially well but to leave it dried and not at least slowing the endsplitting i was experiencing and on top of that running out of product in months i would rather invest my money back into the tresemme products i had been consistently using for years

12867,2.0,the sound quality is very good but as it says the battery last for hours it actually doesnt ive been using it for last four months and now i notice that battery do not last more than two hours poor battery performance and not worth for rs service is too bad my flip is in service center for last one and half month but no action mailed almost times to customer support their reply is always that we have escalated your case to the concerned tem please wait for update now i am going to file a case against jbl in consumer court

12870,4.0,overall i thought this was a very pretty blouse i loved the colors and the design the construction seemed good others mentioned that it ran large but i am tall and often struggle with the shoulders and arms so i purchase my normal size small i believe it is the width in my shoulders that caused the blouse to hang funny you could see a decent amount of the back fabric hanging around the front sides which looked odd it made the front fabric look like it was cut at an angle i am not br
12871,1.0,when working they are great however too often get the response im having trouble playing the music nothing worse than adopting technology only to have it fail at the wrong time
12872,2.0,this jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens but in realitymeh i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket to me it all felt more cloying than clever the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable since i
12873,2.0,disappointed with mi a model battery gets drained pretty quickly usually mi products are known for good battery backup apart from that its ok kind of mobile i would not recommend it to buy
12874,4.0,used in my phone its plenty fast and works just like it should unexpectedly comes with mini and full sd card size adapters which is nice foolproof packaging or whatever it was that was laughable packaging was decent it just shouldnt have bragged about being impossible to mess up when i messed it up

12876,2.0,worst earphones ever the funny part is whenever you try to listen a music of good quality with awesome bass the intention of these heaadpones is the make that music unbearable i wish the brand would have endorsed in technology and quality rather then marketing and actors endorsement
12877,4.0,speakers sounds good at avg low volume level when volume increases the tapping sound appears in speakers as if they are blocking the beat can be heard clearly when there is some bass in the audio overall nice product external speakers can also be used but it will add on to energy bill

12893,5.0,i just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet ive been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it it fits like it was made just for me the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem the second layer is form fitting and soft i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down like a lady and take in my surroundings after all life
12894,4.0,book is good but paper quality is very bad
12895,4.0,touch is good net speed is good but only earphone sound not good after one week use it is the best phone selfie is awesome and i really love its look

12905,2.0,disconnects
12906,3.0,loved this dress until i tried it on it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great im wondering if i just received a defective dress i also wish the dress were a truer orangemango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for springsummer
12907,4.0,worth for money accurate details
12908,2.0,not flattering and not the color it appears online this is really a pink shirt
12909,3.0,i was really excited to receive this caftan but it looked very strange on my body i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me theres also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy the quality is really great but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darkermuted than pictured
12910,1.0,underutilized screen area browsing button area is not for app but just for buttons when wifibluetooth simultaneously on the phone looses wifi connectivity repeatedly sometimes apps hang

12913,1.0,after using it for months the headphone is not working waste of money used it decently but still it stopped working dont spent ur money buying this
12914,3.0,interesting concept but some parts felt repetitive and stretched overall this book is inspiring contains some useful insights mainly focusing on that fact that even through tough times we need to learn and move forward
12915,5.0,the fabric is really soft and the cardi has a cute and comfy slouchy loose fit reminds me of free people cardis with the extra long sleeves and loose fit great to throw on over workout clothes or with jeans and a tee shirt easy piece would size down im getting lots of use out of it
12916,2.0,so i tried this after reading the positive reviews on here and after trying the john frieda frizzease heat guard spray that did nothing for my hair this doesnt work either smells good though i think it may have something to do with the fact that when i put anything wet on my hair after ive dried it my hair just curls up not sure though sooo onto the next thing i believe i need to go with an aveda product since thats what my stylist uses and my hair comes out sooo straight
12917,3.0,worked great for about two weeks but now alexa can barely be heard
12918,1.0,worst product and worst amazon also

12922,1.0,is the current price of the product why ill purchase this instead of a wifi router many good quality wifi router youll found bellow so i doesnt found any reason to buy this product at inr
12923,3.0,i wanted so badly to love this sweater the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm but it does not fit me in a flattering way i cant recommend a size because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers and the sweater slides across my shoulders im it appeared overstretched and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth
12924,1.0,this is a sell in the name of brand image what both amazon and samsung has established it seems like product has not gone through quality tests and lunched hastily due to festive season my honest opinion pros good batterycamera consume battery very fast for moderate use few ui feature given to keep apps away from running in backgroundi felt it better than google androidone ui on this specific aspect it may help in preventing wastage of charge always on display and few gesture controls make it user friendly has good screen brightnesscan be readable at outdoor condition cons camera is a gimmickit will shoot good pics if shots are taken within approx meter radiusobject shot is largeobjects well exposed to light and camera is kept as much as along direction of light source colors do not seem natural pics contain too much noise and very bad edge detectioni have attached mb pic shot mp camera on this phone and mb shot pic shot by a mp camera of mi aviewers can distinguish the quality themselvesthe one shot in mi was shot against light sourcestill it detects good edges and color seems to be naturalwith zoom you can still identify the object and edgesthe one shot in ms although shot along source of light the edges see much distortion by just zooming it with more zoom you can not identify what the object was videos shot even with k contains good amount of noisecolors seem to be super saturated both in pics and videospics shot are much darker than naturalnight mode photography contains immense amount of noiseit only magnifies the brightness wherever color is detectedit distorts the edges badly and you will find noises like dust storm one weird feature i observed is that when you try to shoot pic the handset makes the pic seem times more distant than actual contrary to the pic what it promotes for hot air balloon or the ladakh pic on amazon site audio is not upto the markwith dolby atmos uhs and equalizer on it seems voice loses around clarityit is not loud eithervoice output is not loud even in headphone and the lows and highs are less clear even with good standard headphoneit seems voice is always supressed under instrument or sorrounding sounds screen width to length ratio is such that many videos do not fit to screeneven if zoom option is available making the video full screen makes it lose contents around edge videos played on streaming app on phone clearly seems to loose color reproductionvideos loose sharpness exponentially with increase in movement or motion within videosit seems to be issue with the processoreven video casted to tv see this effect and video played from within internet tv has better color reproduction adapter takes more than hours to fully charge the phone while it is on and around hours if it is switched off out of given gb ram mb reserved for unknown purpose apps take gb even if all put to sleep hence around gb of ram available for use poly carbonate case does not feel sturdy and it seems there is some gap between case and core phone around sim ejectorit seems prone to water seepage even in light drizzle due to lesser screen width it will take more of your effort for typing accurately in portrait modethe reason being keyboard key of less widthin landscape mode keyboard fills of screenit leaves you to type without watching the content output on screeni noticed some word suggestion not of english type while typing in englishex it was suggesting knoledge for knowledge there are security risks i observed i noticed many new apps in my app screen although i never set permission to any app to install other third party appsi personally do not feel safe for banking activities i have noticed all these flaws even if i was using basic handset like mi a for last two yearsexcept for battery mi a handset was superior then this msany person who is not biased for a particular brand handset can clearly identify the quality i would be very happy to return this handset and get my old mi a back if amazon could allow so i could not understand why it tags itself made for india this phrase seems to be a misnomerindians have evolved and have good eye to distinguish compromised and good quality productwill never rely anymore on promotion done by amazon and samsung and paid reviewers who never tell actual issues in a product
12925,5.0,worthier than the price tag picture clarity is amazing sound quality superb all over go for itpicture quality and sound quality is more than what i expected
12927,3.0,got with dish and its word specific but it provides hours of entertainment for the kids lol is nice if your lazy and want to know the time or date
12928,1.0,it lathers well but smells like an old woman perfume i couldnt stand the smell of my hair wet or dry my husband even made a comment about me smelling like an old woman perfume that was the last straw amp i returned it i gave it weeks to try and like it but it did nothing for me regarding volume
12929,2.0,i got this fully discharged i think this is used power bank this is my st day review so i will inform if its faulty or not working properly
12930,4.0,these pants are so soft and comfortable im almost and the hem completely covers my ankles but does stop short of bunching the only thing im not crazy about is the waist its pretty high and a bit loose so every time i get up from sitting im having to pull my pants back up other than that love that its something that can be dressed up or down
12931,4.0,absolute battery beast of a phone days of regular use is easily possible with mobile data or wifi turned on throughout the display is very nice too i was worried about the plastic back but the build quality feels quite nice and its survived a few drops from pocket height without any damage despite not having a case or screen protector the fingerprint reader could be a bit faster but it reads reliably and consistently irrespective of angle or direction the camera quality was a little disappointing performance is great in some conditions and average in most despite the triple shooter i was hoping it would grow on me but the width of the camera panel on the back is still a bit of an eyesore otherwise the aesthetics are quite nice and the opal black variants gradient feels unique and eye catching i recommend a clear case or cover to show it off overall a solid phone at this price range that i strongly recommend the battery life is absolutely unbeatable and everything else is generally up to the mark even if it isnt too flashy
12932,1.0,my phone was defected screen was not working i raised this with amazon and unfortunately they has not entertained my request worst experience i had with amazon
12933,1.0,i sent mine back would only respond to voice commands about in times usually it would shut while a command or question was being spoken instructions were a joke
12934,1.0,did not get any key for this refrigerator
12935,5.0,brilliant product in this category and pricing have been using it since months without any problem
12936,4.0,this was my first tiny shirtdress purchase after seeing the past few patternsseasons for me the last few were a little too busy but something about both patterns this season felt right for summer im and found my usual s to be too long in length and in sleeve length the sleeves being a problem that i never have going to try to exchange for an xs because it really is a lovely piece in both colors though i slightly prefer the green because it feels more tropicalexotic for summe
12937,2.0,i got this in a l and probably i am a m however the waist pretty much fit but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way i dont think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust but a small waist
12938,5.0,fantastic product not as loud as the echo but still a great product for the price works great in the babies room
12939,4.0,best phone in this price tag
12940,4.0,good in the price
12941,2.0,i was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on minutes and broken fingernails later i got done when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person so back it goes even if it had fit i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons why they didnt design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept
12942,1.0,this is unfortunately one of those cheap products that doesnt match up to its expensive competitors bumble amp bumble surf spray is by far better than this youd think the solution wouldnt be that complicated but i swear bampb surf spray is worth its price this stuff did not hold the waves in place it made my hair extremely dry and crunchy as if i sprayed hairspray starch in it within hours my hair just looked like i got electrocuted far from the beachy boho waves i was going for this isnt worth my experience with the organix brand so far has not been good their products are cool in concept but poor in performance
12943,2.0,camera quality very poor as mentioned mp
12944,5.0,good product for this price range
12945,5.0,i love organix products i have tried a lot of their shampoo and conditioner combinations and have been impressed with all of them they smell great are sulfate free and are really good for your hair i will definitely buy these shampoos and conditioners for many years to come
12946,1.0,camera quality and fingerprint is good but to use them battery should be good this product has a very worst battery life i have always been a fan of huawei products this is my th huawei phone as of now but i am totally disappointed with the performance the phone heats up for just mins of phone call battery drains to zero within half a day after charging guys anybody please advise on how i can claim warranty against this issue i have purchased this phone on rd september
12947,1.0,does not work properly it does not charge not expected this
12948,4.0,these bottoms are very cute but defiantly cheeky i would recommend sizing up if you want to have more coverage
12949,5.0,respect to cost its too good to learn vocabulary im pretty sure if you cover this very less will be remain to learn almost every competitive exam you can beat others light weight you can carry everywhere as you want
12950,2.0,first the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer i really wanted to like this top but the fitting is so awkward for me i typically where a xs and sized up in the shirt to a size it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest size a i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow need a strapless bra and made it look unflattering overall had to return this one back to the store
12951,4.0,a decent outlay for competitive exams
12952,1.0,dont buy this phone one of the worst phone my sis asked some phone to buy i suggested this phone beavuse of samsung name thats why i didnt suggest other phones but i ditched her hard earned money worst battery heavy touch response is not good camera is worst
12953,4.0,im not petite but i am short at and while these fit in all the right places the leggings are about inches too long im still deciding whether to return or hem but the hemming would have to be professionally done with this material bummer
12954,4.0,i love these jeans their fit is fabulous and they are very comfortable my new favorite brand of jeans
12955,3.0,very bad mobile operating is very slow and small hanging problem
12956,4.0,i want to the store to try this skirt on that had only one size m in stock my size and it was huge i ordered an xs and it fits nicely its just what i needed for the warm days ahead
12957,1.0,bad performance automatically switch off and on heat problem network problem hang problem then after the performance of return policy of amazon is very poor
12958,4.0,i own kindle paperwhite th gen and my experience with it is very nice but now its battery is not charging and if some how i charged it it last for only half to hr and now its not getting any g network so i have purchased new kindle paperwork th gen for rs it got delivered days back but it started getting hanged and touch screen is also not that sensitive even with gb internal memory but very big surprise is that now its available in rs rs less than what i paid
12959,2.0,i didnt pick it up for its sulfatefree or organic properties but the smell when i flipped open the cap lid i was sold its divine no it didnt weigh down my hair but there are some hairs i want weighed down like the flyaways and baby hairs around the top of my head i also like lather this had very very little and i had to use quite a bit for my long hair when i stepped out of the shower i didnt get that quotsqueaky cleanquot feeling that i happen to like in my shampoos maybe thats the tradeoff you get for an environmentally conscious product who knows but its not a tradeoff im willing to make i grabbed this shampoo when it first came out and had a mailin rebate wrapped around the cap glad i took advantage of that because id never repurchase this shame the lingering scent is so nice
12960,5.0,fingerprint reader and face detector is very fast and it will open within fraction of mili seconds for camera quality i will give u also rating because some best photos i have clicked in ms i couldnt expect better than this like dslr camera and battery life is amazing when i purchased and fully charged at night after whole day working on my new mobile playing games and also surfing net but battery still remains upto and on next day i have charged at pm but at that time also battery remains i give
12961,2.0,i was so excited to get this top and while it is soooo amazingly soft i still could not keep it i must admit that i am only so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this but i felt like a matador which is definitely not what i was going for maybe if your tall and lean this would work but for me no way
12962,4.0,camera awesomesimilar to note probut back camera not upto the mark in low light the camera sucks
12963,5.0,recieved this fast copied over all my stuff which took very little time and now i have plenty of space and speed
12964,1.0,i have got my phone but its having hearing volume problem which is very low i want to replace this phone asap
12965,5.0,loved this book
12966,5.0,dress runs a little small tight on top so i had to exchange from a size to a size originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense the material is light and soft flowers are muted maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute
12967,2.0,this is the worst least effective hair mask ive tried ive even tried leaving it on for minutes covered with shower cap then covered in warm towel leaves my hair feeling like i had not conditioned it at all had a feeling of straw and had so many tangles and knots i found it strange wont buy again still on the search for a good moisturizing hair mask may try a loreal brand
12968,1.0,the charger is not working

13027,5.0,fantastic product only annoying things are sometimes it responds to mystery requests that nobody else hears and no matter what they say those advanced farfield microphones are completely useless if the thing is talking or playing music it simply doesnt hear you over its own noise so you have to wait for a pause or walk up to the thing and shout your command at it

13035,1.0,it appears that the gb sandisk ultra micro sd card i purchased from amazon was defective i installed it in my samsung tablet but could not successfully transfer files using either a usb cable or wifi the file transfer would appear to start but then would slow down and hang completely it did this on every one of multiple attempts with different file types and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file i tried loading files onto the card directly from my pc but then the tablet would not see them i tried reformatting the card both in my pc and in the tablet but still got the same result after a few tries the tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blankunformatted i did an aba with an old gb sandisk micro sd card that i had laying around it worked perfectly formating transferring files reading and writing files everthing worked i put the gb sandisk ultra card back in the tablet but had the same problems again i concluded that the sandisk ultra card was defective and returned it im still using the old gb card without a hiccupthe good thing was that amazons return policy was quick and painless
13036,2.0,product received on time there is no issue sharing my experience here for you to decide before you go for this product only during calls suddenly it goes blank there is no noise cancellation or its not working properly always people on call ask me are you outside we are getting so many noise i have ordered replacement after days i received serviced item may be before that someone used and returned to boat same issue persist but now i dont know what to do and i am not using this for important office calls just using for hearing music watching movies replacement process is good they only come and collect your product and return using courier if you raise ticket online problem rectified or not thats matter overall my suggestion experience i could say dont go for this product if you really want to use it for official purpose

13062,2.0,unfortunately this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of i have sent it back for a refund too big too shapeless
13063,3.0,honor x is good to use but if you are buying a smartphone for the first time then go for oppo or vivo phones because there are some security settings issues with honor products and battery is also not so good it stays only to hrs if i uses internet for hrs

13070,3.0,i really wanted to love this dress i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it sadly the top was just too balloon like and poofed out way too much i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome i dont know if a smaller size would have helped the issue i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it
13071,4.0,i purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it i found it to be pretty true to size even after washing its a little sheer so youd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work its a great top for springsummer

13086,2.0,i love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasnt so flattering on such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee
13087,5.0,freakishly amazing device astonishing does everything you expected to do very well plus does your dishes at this price point they are giving these away just to make sure one is in your home a delightful device for the disabled reads books tells news music weather turns on lights by voice makes disabled people lives richer and safer now if they just dont over do the marketing

13089,4.0,i didnt end up keeping this and i feel like i might regret it i have a similar sweater this jacket is super streamlined with a sleek fit the bummer for me was that it didnt have snaps to hold the collar down to the jacket when it was unzipped so the flaps seemed to flop around the s was perfect not too tight im lbs c

13092,4.0,this is a very nice smart tv if you are looking for a budget tv then it is the best tv in this price picture quality is very good sound is also good and apps are working well sometimes youtube lags little bit but in this price range you have to adjust this overall i can say this is far better than its price no doubt anyone can buy this tv without any hesitation its not look like rs k tv
13093,4.0,very well made and would flatter the right body type i sized up to a medium normally size but the front part where the wrap came together did not cover me the only thing you could see was the grey liner im not sure this one was not sewn incorrectly or it ran terribly small i have had success with bailey in the past so maybe this one was just not for me the quality of the fabric and design are well done
13094,3.0,ummm
13095,3.0,good read nothing great though
13096,2.0,i got this product yesterday at the drugstore ive had the brazilian blowout before it got pulled from the market and i loved it too bad it was completely toxic anyways this claimed no formaldehyde but after reading reviews there must be some chemical that i have not reacted well to i did the procedure long but that was expected anyways something in it or im coming down with a bug has made me feel really sick i was feeling so noxious that i had to take the afternoon off work and wash it out i can still smell it though after hours of keeping it in i can tell the curl is softer and its easier to blow dry i bet if i was able to handle the product and leave it in it would be great
13097,1.0,i received the fridge without back sides legs the delivery man said it does not come with back leg therefore the fridge is tilted from back this causes lots of discomfort while opening i feel cheated
13098,5.0,this is a very cute top i am lbs dd and a large fit great it fit perfectly in the chest but the top is meant to be baggy at the bottom and long it covers my bum looks very cute with skinny jeans love it
13099,3.0,fair product features poor sound
13100,3.0,image quality ok but offline screen mirroring not working
13101,3.0,i found this dress to be beautiful only down side youd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt im usually size sm in maeve i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage im lbs d hips id need an xl
13102,2.0,this could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed perhaps it could be used for a tank i am but do have a long torso it did not fully cover my booty
13103,1.0,times compressor failure in a year or less pathetic product
13104,3.0,its kinda meh i used this with the other products i use for damp hair and i apply this exclusively to my ends i dont use a lot of it since it covers a lot of hair and it makes my ends super soft afterwards however after five minutes my hair feels just about the same as it did before my ends are still soft but they look dull the formula is also super thick so it might be better suited for people with really dry hair mine is normal ive tried to incorporate this into my hair routine but it doesnt do anything for my hair no matter how yummy and tropical it sounds wont repurchase
13105,1.0,no installation and demo service providedproduct received on th oct in build software not compatible with its versionunable to open like youtube
13106,5.0,after buying a generic card and having a terrible experience i purchased the sandisk ultra my only regret was not buying this product first sandisk is a brand worth buying
13107,1.0,i love the idea of this shirt but the execution is absolutely horrible i ordered online and what i received is just a mess the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread not just a few hanging off but literally big clumps a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside the fit is just as big a mess i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
13108,4.0,best phone everything is good display is goodperfect camera but theres a difference in portrait camera between mia and mia and about battery does not last for long it drains when you use it for long timerater than that everything is perfect
13109,1.0,vol low
13110,2.0,the fit of the top is true to size but i really dont like the taupe terryclothlike sweatshirt under the white lace the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe it is terrible paired together i also didnt like the feel of the terryclothlike fabric against my skin even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail im absolutely sending it back
13111,4.0,its good
13112,5.0,no size fit me im normally a s to m the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow perhaps in length so i ended up without it sadly its really a very nice top and great quality i was unhappy to leave it behind
13113,2.0,microphone speaker not successful
13114,2.0,i ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey but its much more than drapey and the front draping looks like halloween costume material not chic or sophisticated sadly i will be returning this top
13115,3.0,laptop is good but no natural silver colour not available is the big disadvantage and no socket to attach pc with internet by routine cable
13116,5.0,im very happy with my decision to buy note pro
13117,3.0,the fit on these is good for my hourglass shape and the fabric quality and comfort is good tooi think the rinse is just not as nice in person the orange stitching is pretty bright too i bought a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these i am going to return these and see if they have something better but will only buy in store from now on
13118,2.0,im kind of rough user i always use headset for hr a day so in my opinion this product has good sound quality and very poor built quality i doesnt even last months
13119,4.0,this is a great shirt its super comfortable and fits nicely not too big and not too small you can wear it with leggings or dress it up with skinny jeans and boots i bought the striped and black one i highly recommend it
13120,4.0,the m battery capacity is amazing and i just love it the processor speed is also very good and when its come to display even it is not a amoled display the colours are very good on this screen and there is not heating problem one more thing to talk is about its build quality which is very good i am using it for past months it fell down for around times and only scratches on it nothing else the major defect is camera if you want a good camera mobile then its not your choice the you can go for samsung m totally out of stars precisely fingerprint and face unlocking system are very good battery is good display and build quality are excellent for camera just out of stars
13121,1.0,this card only lasted two weeks before it began giving read errors i used it in a dash cam and no matter how many times i formatted it would only record for about a minute before failing again i picked up a pny card since and it has worked beautifully unfortunately ive been swamped and forgot to return this card before my days not happy about that

13125,5.0,im running a live linux system off of this card right now via a usb port seems to have good readwrite speeds and is durable
13126,3.0,i waited and got this sweater at the winter sale i ordered the navy in a medium the design is pretty but as has been said i was surprised at how short it is i do love the detail the tie back nice weight i have not found it to be itchy the sweater i received was a store return and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy but for i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over i do need to wear a cami underneath as the sides are more revealing than pictures the first day

13142,3.0,should have gorilla glass other vise ok phone
13143,4.0,its display is colourful and battery life is also good to days on a continuous usage but the spo is not working most of the times it is asking me to tighten the strap and stay still even though the strap is tightened at its maximum i can not comment on the correctness as i do not have reference for heart rate or spo overall its a decent purchase for the price
13144,4.0,good choice for the below k price range gb ssd gets you a good start for gaming boot time is atmost sec games run well just need to optimize the nvidia game experience accordingly you can control the heat but reducing from the optimal level in the game experience software battery lasts for about hours on normal usage that is excel reports youtube movies songs etc combined the charger is small unlike the behemoth brick charger we get webcam is also okay not much to talk about display though is sub par not that bad but it is not quite good sound is also subpar but you can adjust definately not a deal breaker the design is sleek and it weighs around kg can carry it with out much effort mcafee antivirus is for month only if it matters to you people warranty is year for the product contact the service centre to extend it last but not the least a good choice for midrange gaming pubg was running on ultra with no problem in case you want a benchmark reference with no stats
13145,5.0,it is i phone no comment required
13146,5.0,soft comfortable flattering great for spring summer fall and wear a tight black longsleeved tee underneath for winter not formfitting even if you size down
13147,4.0,i love this dress i love the style i love the pattern i love the feel of the fabric theres a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me however i think it runs a little large particularly because its not fitted at all that tie around the waist is the only defining feature and its a great one this dress and your figure needs it i am pounds and i normally wear a perhaps i shouldve known to try a small but i went with my usual size in dresses
13148,3.0,i am using this last months after sound quality is very bad and poor battery life
13149,1.0,i received the product in september and when i opened it i noticed a very minor scratch i didnt bother much as the power bank seem to work fine within two weeks it stopped working i couldnt return it as the return window got closed when i went to claim warranty they denied the warranty citing the same scratch i ignored initially extremely bad experience key lesson learnt however to be super demanding about quaity when ordering from amazon
13150,5.0,its a very nice product and the camera is just amazing
13151,4.0,the fabric is beautiful a bit sheer but overall lovely however the sizing is really off fyi c broad shouldersback my usual size in a fitted top this one is very fitted in the waist and bust is a i tried the and and the side zipper wouldnt come near closing it is very very nipped right under the bust so if you have no bustline and a super small waist this top is for you if you are like me high waist and straight up and down this is a pass in fact it is really h
13152,3.0,good gadgetbut many skills and services are restricted to us and here in argentina they are not workingtill now im using it to play a bunch of radios calendar alarms and shopping listin settings just are available us zip codesit will be good if you develop or unrestrict skills and services for other countries
13153,5.0,tried this is my normal and it fits exactly as shown i can see how this could give issues to someone with any curves because the lining is definitely more fitted than the loose overlay especially in the bust and hips i found the quality to be very nice length was slightly above the knee on my frame so it feels workappropriate my only wish is that the colorspattern could transition better to multiple seasons it definitely feels very springy and not much else
13154,3.0,meets expectation
13155,3.0,i havent recieved a warranty card with the product

13166,3.0,i had a really really difficult time reviewing this dress the instant i touched it i wanted to love it in theory it should have worked for me fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body best of both worlds however as you can see for yourself in the photo this dress makes me look pretty big im a solid size and i feel this dress makes me look like a it really makes my middle

13179,5.0,these pants lived up to expectations the fabric is very soft and did not wrinkle in the dryer i am normally not a big fan of cropped styles but love that these have the gathered leg and can be styled dressier or casual i thought the cargo pockets might stick out too much but they lay nicely i feel i will get a lot of use from these and the best part is they are not constrictive and they are super comfy
13180,4.0,mast phone mast camera
13181,1.0,i loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it but trying it on was a very different story the photo seems to show a wider more welldefined waist with just a small amount of blousing on top but this was not the case yes the waist fit but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the illfitting top turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit sadly this is going right back
13182,5.0,im and pounds and got a medium the cut is very flattering on me and i have received many compliments when i wear it it is lined so no need to wear a cami underneath
13183,4.0,i saw this online when it was full price and was tempted to buy it because i liked it but did not when i saw it on sale definitely wanted to try it i bought a large and it was too big in the torso area so i returned and got a medium and it fit better and flattered my figure better i so rarely wear a medium in anything retailer so i would say this runs large i have received compliments on this dress the first day i wore it it is comfortable love the colors and design it is fun very g

13186,3.0,i bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg im extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts i love the shorts otherwise

13192,3.0,wifi disconnects automatically have to reconnect in between running programm rest is ok
13193,2.0,the lace and fit were good but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowyish the dress is it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something and i hated the outside middle material hated it it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece
13194,5.0,this is my first dslr and im very happy for having it it comes with enough features which every beginner needs but thing to dislike is it does not support any local external flash gunlike sonia digitekgodoxonly canons original flashgun works with it which is worth k

13196,2.0,i was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable however while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist i will acknowledge im a runner with somewhat muscular legs but was hopeful these pants wouldnt cling to them for reference im lbs and usually wear a size in pants
13197,5.0,excellent camera
13198,4.0,in the store i was immediately drawn to the bluewhite combination but on the opposite side of the rack hung the spring colored one which i ultimately tried on it was obvious that the dress was a bit oversized so i chose the smaller of my two dress sizes to try on this was the right choice but it was still really big i am not sure that i could have gone down another size mostly i wear a in dresses that are fitted due to my bust c and broad backshoulders from the front th

13202,2.0,not a good conditioner unfortunately it left my hair very tangled and difficult to blowdry its main saving graces are its soft but luscious fragrance that lingers in my hair and the shine it gives i bought a huge bottle on sale at cvs so ill just use up the bottle but will never repurchase

13214,5.0,this is the most intricate delicate beautiful dress i have seen in a long time the pale blue coppery brown and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin dark hair and light eyes unfortunately my normal size was far too snug especially on my hips and this is now sold out the fabric has no give so i would say with any curves size up if you can find this beauty im heartbroken to be returning it

13228,3.0,the smell reminded me of something but couldnt put my finger on it out ah ha vanilla fields perfume from back in the day inital thoughtssmells good starts off like a pudding consistency but thins out quickly once it is mixed with water or put onto the hair for my long hair i need quite a bit to cover all of it and even then it is not coated well product does not have much slip if any at all in order to receive any conditioning benefit i have to use a lot of product and leave at least minutes also in order to have any smoothng effect i need to apply high on my head starting above the ears it did hydrate my hair but did not offer any detangling the first couple of days i noticed my hair seemed a bit weighed down but not too bad and at first it did nothing for frizz after two weeks my hair is no longer weighed down even though i am now using more product and it has helped to smooth down some of the frizz it has not eliminated it by any means but i am ok with the overall result i do not even need a smoothing product anymore whatever frizz is left i can smooth out with the blowdyer and brush over time my hair looked healthier and shiny but because of the tangles my hair is now breaking due to brushing it out so it was counteracting the benefits overall i will not repurchase because for the price and size of the bottle i have to use way too much of this on my hair and due to the tangles it is causing more damage even though my hair was soft and shiny tried on my daughters hair and her hair looked very shiny almost shimmery too bad it does not detangle
13229,2.0,you must read the review and decide yourself whether to purchase this fragile phone or not because there no returns on this purchase in order to make it available at cheapest possible price xiomi has cut corners on several fronts read on sound quality is absolutely not upto the mark plastic body is so thin phone has become fragile volume rocker buttons are not going to last for many months they are thin and weak no gorilla glass screen it looks unimpressive overall it is totally disappointing to hold the redmi a camera megapixleswise ok but havent tested the performance miui greatbut with smaller screen not fun to operate it surprisingly gb ram is inadequate for faster response of opening apps or unlocking the screen phone is extremely prone to usual use screen damage and wear and tear also not strong enough to withstand daily use god forbid if you drop the phone its the end foe the phone it will not just damage the screen but the entire assembly motherboard etc i would never recommend this phone despite its specifications because it s not strong enough

13238,3.0,a pleasantly engaging toy with some entertaining skills but not the helper i was hoping for i was hoping to use the echo as a way of staying in close contact with my blind elderly mother who lives miles away i was hoping to use the dropin feature as a sort of longdistance intercom connecting us by means of our respective wifi networks there was one major hitch however it appears that for this functionality to work both parties must have a smart phone my mother does not have a cell phone and there is no cellular signal accessible at her home anyway amazon needs to enhance the product so that dropin can be used even if only wifi is available and may use only a wifi connected tablet for the app to manage settings contacts etc if i have missed finding the means to make this work as described i hope someone will let me know
13239,2.0,i expect much bass but this item disappointed me low bass and high stereoits not suitable for quality and music lovers
13240,5.0,this is a sweet little jacket i saw it in the store but was unsure because of the price but after trying it on i just fell in love the cut is really flattering the jacket does run small i really enjoy the little pop of color on the sleeves my only complaint is the buttons make me nervous because they seem to be heavy and i worry that ill lose one but only on the front the arms and back buttons seem to be just fine overall this is a fantastic buy that is great for an office setting

13255,3.0,edit review after months usage pros excellent build quality and finishing definitely better than any other make looks as good as new touch and screen response is smooth was better with ios still fast enough see cons good earphone sound quality cons cannot transfer files from to windows pc or android using bluetooth cannot save audio files from whatsapp to music library as easily as android have to use rd party app just to save any document pathetic camera picture quality clarity if compared with even samsung phones of have to use rd party camera app to get slightly better pictures it is unnessesary headache having to everytime use itunes for pc sharing very difficult to get a strong wifi signal in free public wifi zones this happened to all iphone users in my workplace using company authorised wifi service for employees android users had no problems have to manually enter settings in mobile data everytime you enter roaming zones in my case had to contact mobile operator to assist me phone has slowed down noticeably since upgrading to ios night time photography is useless very poor colours and very dark grainy pics even rd party apps dont solve this problem cannot delete photos saved from pc unless connected to pc via itunes and following a lengthy process changed over to iphone from galaxy note due to rapid device slowdown exactly after years of usage same which had happened to my previous note and note it will remain to be seen how the s will perform in years time so far after days of use and getting used to ios i am finding it very enjoyable to use a bit restricted when it comes to transferring and sharing files and photos especially via bluetooth but since it all works via a common channel itunes it is very organised excellent fit and finish received in good condition easy to use interface camera although of very good quality is not as good as samsung note when it comes to exposure and colours possibly due to lack of ois and aperture size

13258,3.0,this sweater has potential but it wasnt right for me the collar isnt flattering on metoo thick and my shoulders are already broad my waist is high so i need a longer look the color is true to size but its s little see throughdark bra shows through
13259,5.0,amazing mobile face recognition is to fastfinger print is fast battery is good camera is good
13260,3.0,i ordered the navygray combo in size xl it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear it also attracted so much lint the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it it added weight and was unflattering for my shape the colors do match the photos online the length also matches the models photos it just didnt work for me
13261,3.0,this is a beautiful and warm sweater well cut and easy to dress up or down the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing especially against wool or cashmere winter coats
13263,1.0,this product is very worstthis product screen is very poor automatic camera open and automatically video call any contact no
13264,3.0,st impression is good front camera is better than realme pro but back camera is pathetic comparatively it is slightly overpriced
13265,3.0,its ok fit doesnt wow me because of my body chest is too wide hips look too narrow drapes across my back fat in an especially nonflattering way basically made my squareapple body look more squareapple great part about this dress is that its comfy and hides the tummy pooch construction is poorly donecontrasting liner at vneck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally another negative point is dry clean only boo im an
13266,4.0,i like this product as it works very well at first it only showed but when i plugged my camera using this microsdhc into my laptop and seen that this card had partitions on it i had to chose the correct one to use otherwise i couldnt take many pictures or videos
13267,5.0,simple blazer with cute details buttons on the back and lining this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties i was able to go with the regular size instead of petite because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up
13268,3.0,heats up while charging
13269,3.0,when i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight the problem is the hem it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package and i should have noticed and returned it but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing well it wasnt and it gets worse every time i wash the dress its like the hem isnt constructed properly
13270,5.0,i am more or less stuck with the ios platform because of the iwatch since i love its functionality upgraded from my yr old iphone was actually waiting for prices to drop post september this year but when amazon came up with an unbelievable prime deal i couldnt resist everything on the phone works as it is supposed to no complaints the battery however is a beast i always used to carry my power bank along with me for the iphone but i no longer need to with the xr easily gives me an entire day of use with more than hr sot and still have about juice left looking forward to what ios brings
13271,2.0,this was a little better than the shampoo but not by much the shampoo left my long thick hair feeling really dry and tangled this had a lot of slip in the shower and at first i thought id like it but it simply did not make up for how harsh the shampoo is and made my hair feel really flat when it dried not a huge fan of the smell either pros good slip affordable cons dont like the smell really thin so i had to use a lot left hair flat not conditioning enough
13272,1.0,while i love the organix biotin amp collagen shampoo this conditioner falls flat the consistency is too thin and it simply doesnt make my hair feel any softer
13273,3.0,though the phone is a budget oriented productbut they should seriously look after the designit no way feels premium to the handsthe hightweight ratio is not okit feels like a cheap plastic phone to handthe camera is a suckthe aperture back camera fails to take significant picturesit just looks overally good in open eyebut when you zoom them they really struggles

13278,4.0,i should have known to size up since that is what i usually do for skinny jeans ordered a size should have done good quality denim just too tight in the legs for my taste i debated trying a bigger size but decided i just dont love the distressed look on me although i love that they offer highrise petites for reference lbs curvy on bottom usually a size for pants

13281,5.0,i tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great the fabric is thin which is nice for summer but lined at the top half so its not transparent except below the knee the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite sadly it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast
13282,5.0,shandar
13283,4.0,other reviewers have pointed out that these tops i have both colors now spoilers run long and i am happy to agree basically theres a lot to work with here im always looking for longer tops to traverse a larger bust and this is a great hiphitting length for me plus the neckline can be style multiple ways all in all a flattering betterthanbasic sweater
13284,5.0,awesome book delivered on time
13285,2.0,i ordered the orange in size xl the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length the quality is bad i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived new in the packages with one having a small hole the knit is so thin as is the base material the arms are basically seethrough it doesnt offer any warmth because of the thinness i layered a longsleeved white tee underneath which helped the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour i also had two area
13286,3.0,this is a pretty good volumizing shampoo it got my oily roots clean left my hair volumized and smells lovely on the downside it did leave my thick coarse long hair crunchy and impossible to comb without adding lots of heavy conditioner and product it would probably work great for someone with different hair but it just wasnt right for me

13293,4.0,bought this phone for rs during diwali sale camera quality is average but performance battery life and amoled screen makes this phone value for money

13295,2.0,as soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging i feel in love with them the fabric was so soft i could not wait to get them onyeah that was not going to happen i could not pull them on not even a little bit these pants run incredibly small i ordered them twice once in my regular size and again in a larger size unfortunately i am sized out of these beauties
13296,2.0,i purchased this to wear on the same day it did have a strong smell i tried airing but didnt help much so didnt wear tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing by hand my fault for not checking this part it is a bit over my price range for a casual top so hoping ill end up loving it

13319,5.0,i bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks its really stunning the red is incredibly vibrant especially for linen and the construction is very highquality since its linen it feels crisp and light and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flatout hot days the rayon slip is a really nice touch too since the linen is fairly transparent it really drove home the sense of quality for me i bought mine in size regular which i found slightly big i
13320,3.0,i ordered this sweater in a medium with high hopes im and slender but with a bust and the medium was too loose and long sleeves fell past my wrists i would exchange this for a small for a better fit but the color is not the white or cream color i was expecting the color of this sweat is more of an oatmeal not flattering on a farskinned blonde i think the color would look fantastic on someone with dark hair as it does on the girl in the photo the texture is great and i re

13325,2.0,smells great like coconut cream pie unfortunately like the other reviewers it left my hair dry and full of tangles i am now using the coconut milk conditioner as a shave gel for my legs it works great in that regard
13326,4.0,this top is a classic subtle sexy top great for casual wear and especially to go on a date the hem of the sleeves have a slit neat detail small fit me well width wise but sleeves are too long in pass my wrist but i cannot roll them up because the bell shape does not hold and i cannot hem them because they would lose the original stitching i am ftin b waist no petite size so i passed cloth and stone is better in making petite size but not for most items sad for us shorties
13327,5.0,purchased in the light grey and was so excited i wore it the very next day the back detailing and pocket make it more unique than a regular tee and the fabric is slightly heavy in a good way so it hangs beautifully easily can be dressed up or down new favorite tee
13328,4.0,loved the version of this loc top that retailer carried two years ago or was it three was thrilled to see what looked like the same top and was called the same name but its just not the same length is too short body is too wide and even the fabric seems to be lower quality disappointing but i still bought more than one color

13333,4.0,this product is amazing i wear quot extensions that tend to get frizzy and tangle if i dont use smoothing products and brush them out often i use pumps of this on my hair in the morning and at night works on either wet or dry hair and then comb it out and it keeps the ends of my hair smooth and silky plus the scent is to die for its a little bit sticky but if you dont use too much and brush it through your hair well it doesnt seem to be a problem its a bit expensive for a drug store brand i think i paid but you get a nice sized bottle of good quality product

13340,1.0,i have been looking for a fallspring coat to wear when the weather is between and degrees this coat looks great in the pictures but so disappointing in reality the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft it is unlined so im not sure why youd even wear it if the weathers warm enough to wear a thin unlined jacket why not just wear a sweater the weight is not what i would expect at this price point even worse the design is terrible my husband who has a great eye

13390,4.0,very cute love the animals on it especially the bunnies however not sure about fit fits perfectly at waist but fabric expands a bit further down it seems to billowpuffbag in lower part not at bottom but in the stomach area like there is too much fabric so it fits but also looks like theres something slightly off interested in hearing others opinions about this also i am slightly und ft thereno petite option but the standard stops slightly above my knees so length seems ok
13391,1.0,its absolutely waist product after guarantee period its lost back up cant charging
13392,3.0,good book but too much descriptive
13393,2.0,im d this dress did nothing for me the seem on the side with the knot doesnt look right its almost on the side but not really theres a seem down the center of the butt from the waist it looks weird from the back because its such a fine striped print not flattering at all the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining hit me just a bit lower than on the model
13394,3.0,excellence
13395,1.0,waste to buy this
13396,1.0,charger stopped working after a week of use only used once they told it is not covered under warranty and cannot be repaired need to buy new one need to spend k dont buy nikon
13397,2.0,saw this product in the local supermarket and was attracted by the cute packaging once i smelt it i was sold initial use was all good however after a month of regular use every second or third day this stuff has killed my hair ive noticed much more breakage it has stripped the colour and shine from my hair and has left it feeling like straw now i need to go purchase a treatment to fix my hair will never repurchase or try other organix products again
13398,3.0,the audio cracks at volume bass is kinda artificialbuy only if its available at around i brought it for
13399,5.0,battery is the only fear that i expect will be low but thanks to power management it is gently goes approx hrs easily with normal working like hrs youtube internet full day location on and more over calling more than hrs in a day what i use daily very sufficient for me as unexpected from this mah battery only moreover camera quality is just mind blowing specially front camera and rear portrait mode and nightscape mode is awesome and also macro mode is just fantastic onebeat every segment of flagship not its time to screenso its like butter in ur handjust one word to explain this mini moster is awesome my first oneplus phone it is and i just love oneplus
13400,3.0,does its job and fairly cheap for what its worth i had to return my first one and exchange it for another because the first one was defective sandisk really needs to do better quality assurance on their products the second one works perfectly fine i use it for my gopro camera
13401,2.0,didnt hate it but didnt love it either i had hopes this would smell similar to paul mitchell awapuhi shampoo but it did not smell like it at all it didnt wow me i used this in combination with the organix awapuhi conditioner i cant tell that this repairs anything i wouldnt repurchase
13402,2.0,overpriced

13404,1.0,this is my nd note pro the screen developed a yellow colour on the top left corner of the first phone the second one also developed the same complaint in one and half months time screen got some problem strongly recommend never buy this phone
13405,5.0,its value for money the product is as expected battery life is good one day compete usage with g and still you are left with around battery overall a great product purchased days prior to this review
13406,4.0,its a nice sturdy device bit slow but effective in its price range when used for limited work it cannot be used for gaming routine office work is fine it comes with licensed windows so thats a huge plus i have been using it for a month without any adverse event
13407,2.0,these are very pretty but i have had a few problems with them out of the package i found them to be true to size i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs however even though they are machine washable i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short i am barely over tall also the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing which drives me crazy i have to keep straightening it i think there are better options for sleep pants
13408,5.0,great product plan on buying two more
13409,5.0,i love my echo dot i use this one in the bedroom for evening music and information once winter comes i will have even more use being able to turn on my thermostat
13410,2.0,does not respond always

13415,2.0,finger touch screen is get fault within six month of purchase
13416,2.0,i ordered this in my usual size small b bust around lbs but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didnt cinch in at the waist at all rather bubbled out a bit the tunic flaps laid strangely as well like they were too small almost the high cut sides were indeed high cutshowing the waistband of my leggings apparently that is a new style as i have seen a few other tops like it around but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on
13417,3.0,this skirt is not what i was expecting at all for starters it runs large i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldnt lay flat and gaped at the front no bueno my biggest gripe though is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled the background color of this skirt is not even close to
13418,3.0,look wise speaker is good fm not working at all connection is lil weak there is a little disturbance in the connection yes it is loud but sound quality is too noisy it also shakes when volume is full aux provided is of no use with xiomi phones battery is ok

13425,2.0,update i sold the phone after a week without even putting my sim in it review after having used the lg g for a bit over years i finally and very hesitantly decided to go for a mi phone got it in the first sale and was delivered the next day and its been disappointing me at almost everything except battery life heres my observations cons first first the mp camera is a gimmick wide angle is not as wide as the lg the rd camera with a x optical zoom shouldve been a lossless zoom but thats not the case overall disappointing bunch of cameras the edges of the screen are weirdly and horrendously rounded with a bit of color bleed the supposedly amoled display is abundantly bright but lacks sharpness and details and even changes color when looked at sideways just like in tft displays of the yesteryears screen resolution is criminally low i wonder why i didnt notice it before buying almost a deal breaker ambient light sensors dont work too well and screen is too bright even in pitch dark conditions not a fan on inscreen fingerprint scanners in general this one is faster than oneplus t but still very slow and doesnt register my index finger most of the times i thought stock android interface would be good but having used nova launcher on the g for almost a year now i think it sucks big time it is not user friendly at all and you need multiple taps even for simple things like changing screen brightness theres no auto brightness button in pulldown menu not too many customizations possible the sound from the downfiring speaker is just okay but plug in a pair of headphones and get ready to be yes disappointed the sound output from the audio jack is too low almost muted and lacks details this is definitely a deal breaker for me not really a con but if they provided a silicon back case in the box they couldve easily given a screen protector too though the phone supports w charging theyve only packed a w charger in the box pros it is one of the very few compact phones available in the market today one of the reasons why i went for it everyone is making humongous phones now a days the size of our palms is not growing i dont understand why the screen sizes are it charges very fast if i use my lgs watt charger the phone is really pretty to look at although a bit tacky overall im not happy at all with this phone i may be wrong in comparing it with a phone more than times its price when i bought it but the fact that even on th day of receiving it im still using my year old lg g says a lot the screen alone is a dealbreaker
13426,5.0,lots of fun and helps with daily household chores shopping lists and to do lists funny jokes great music and answers any questions you have
13427,3.0,i like this productbut the quality is too bad compare to nokia in the beginninglooking nice but too lite weightit may broken easily

13430,2.0,if i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse the problem area is evident looking at the photo the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house
13431,3.0,this sweater is great i bought the black version on sale my complaint is the pulling factor though you dont expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed

13436,3.0,average phone from samsung camera is not actual pixel
13437,5.0,samsung the brand itself is sufficient but i like to add more points the best battery backup on any smartphone samoled display of samsung is the best the best display among smartphones is by samsung and it also manufdctures for apple the processor is good and battery efficient cameras are good at the price segment takes minutes to charge full and then can give more than days battery life sound is dolby but only for earphones and headphones and also speaker is loud nothing more to tell just aplly the bank offers and go for it
13438,2.0,we bought this along with the echo tower the dot arrived first and i had no problems connecting it to my iphone when the echo tower arrived i connected to it but then got disconnected from the echo dot now neither one will connect to my phone it does randomly disconnects from wifi not as bad as the echo tower the speaker quality isnt great at all but it is a small device thats not really designed for superb sound since the dot doesnt recognize my amazon account it doesnt recognize that im an prime music customer so we cant stream music weve contacted echo customer service and have done what theyve asked but it still didnt work basically its functioning as an alarm clock so long as it doesnt disconnect from wifi
13439,3.0,battery backup is very very bad i full charged this phone to times in a day finger print scanner not working in one touch it work in to touch camera quality is not good there is no option for privacy app encryption there is no option for face unlock

13442,2.0,this is a stylistic review on the white version there are plenty other reviews to read about the performance as a producti ordered a clear wall mount so i could mount this on my white wall dont be fooled by the image it is not light grey it is darkbut the inexcusable is that the charger and cord are black so of course now i have to live with an ugly black cord on the wall order a white charger and cable or alexa order bottles of whiteout and paint the cord
13443,4.0,the cut of this shirt is lovely and well thought out the opening for the arm are not too big like some other shirts i liked the material and the melon salmon color which i ordered was more vibrant in person this does run large so i wished i had ordered one size down
13444,4.0,i definitely think this may have worked had i tried on a petitesized version for the length i was not at one of the stores with the petites i did feel like at the regular size is just too long i tried a size on with leggings and that didnt look right the size seemed fine b chest lbs maybe if i had a different pair of pants on but the slits up the sides of the shirt made it look not quite right with leggings i kept thinking the shorter size would have helped i really li

13449,4.0,this gorgeous dress arrived today the color is beautiful but the sizing way off i cannot move my arms it is extremely snug across the shoulders but the rest of the dress is loose as shown in the picture if i went up a size to fit my shoulders id be swimming in this dress so all you gals out there with anthletic tendencies beware of this dress it is for women without shoulderswith tiny arms too bad this is otherwise gorgeous would look great worn over a sexy slip with the bo

13454,4.0,this is a very comfortable dress i absolutely love the design the feel structured and has weight and the sleeves perfect dress for brunch and work the fit is not giving in the chest area i needed to go up a size due to the inflexibility of the material even tried it without a bra nope wasnt a happening i ordered a size up and love it the only con are the buttons they are very thin and not a good choice for the heavy fabric broke one in the fitting room
13455,3.0,i wanted something for the hot summers here and this fits the ticket very lightweight and airy its somewhat of a strange design short in the front hitting an inch or two above the knee but the back is unusually long the lining is awkward and kind of tight and difficult to get into the material is very thin and although i havent noticed any strings or unraveling like other reviewers its not the highest quality overall the dress is nice and lightweight but not the greatest quality
13456,3.0,this is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldnt for a few reasons i thought id share the color is bright orange it is not softer like peach in the picture it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear i thoughtd be more swingy but it was more structured very pretty and good qualitytho

13477,3.0,ive been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff id prefer a softer kind of fabric i wonder if it would soften if it was washed also it ran surprisingly small i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didnt leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms the medium worked better i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing i think ill wait and see if this one goes on sal
13478,2.0,this stuff made my hair sticky and hard to comb through also tangle easily its a bit more expensive but trust me its way more worth it to buy regis desing line silk repair and shine silk drops oh and i also didnt see any improvement with my split ends after using it for weeks straight

13504,5.0,i have been wearing joes jeans for years and have a hefty stable of varieties in my wardrobe recently pairs of their skinny leggings have worn out much quicker than expected which has caused me to question their construction and overall durability i have had my eye on these pilco legging jeans for a while but every time i have gone to pull the trigger my size has been sold out finally all the stars aligned just as i bid my final pair of joes skinnys adieu and i was able to purchase
13505,2.0,the design is very strange the inner slip is quite formfitting but the dress on top was just massive like a sack on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with they looked weird just hanging off the side so i tried to knot them like a belt overall this dress was not attractive on it looks much better on the model the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life harsher red blue and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured
13506,5.0,hopefully these will get cheaper but worth every cent to have more recording time i used of these for christmas work great and you have good eyes

13520,3.0,i ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape when it arrived it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty muted pink however once i put it on it clinged to all the wrong places having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i cant wear a standard bra with it its too complicated in a regular tank dress it would have been a yes overall a great dress but probably for another body type
13521,3.0,just got these today because they were a steal of a deal with the sale on sale was super excited because the pattern is adorable i put them on tonight and noticed that they firstly arent eloise like i assumed they would be and secondly that they werent as soft as i had expected all of the retailereloise pajamas i have purchased in the past have been so soft and comfortable you dont want to take them off did i get an off pair that just happened to not be as soft im not sure but im

13524,3.0,i am totally on the fence with this shirt like the other reviewers i sized up because my normal was too tight in the chest a common problem for me the arms are strangely tight and i didnt get much more room in the bust with the but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side i love the pattern and material though so im going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart

13561,4.0,good with amazon
13562,2.0,i wanted to love this shirt the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through sadly i will be returning
13563,3.0,this design looks really sharp on the image but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi the fabric had that polyestershiny quality to it that made it look cheap since the fabric was pretty soft with a gray jersey lining it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b i felt like i was busting out of a size and i am a d
13564,2.0,book was quite good easy to understand but delivery was very bad in condition
13565,4.0,i tried on the xs in the store lbs dd chest short fit i think it is a little big i would tend to go for a xxs petite in this for me the length was ok but would look more flattering in petite also the waist was on the looser side the green color is amazing though very flattering and springysummery the flow of the dress is also very nice the weird thing is the belt at the waist it starts a little off from the seam and doesnt go all the way around not sure if i love it or
13566,1.0,using after days mobile off when put on any place ie table every time so contract customer care immediately its very bad experience first time
13567,4.0,i ordered this to go over a dress i wanted the jacket short to not cover the waist of the dress on sale i think it is a great bargain the sleeves are long on me but i rolled them which i thought was intended since they are lined the medium fit me i am usually an in tops the ivory color is almost a pure white
13568,3.0,this is the most honest and accurate review you will find the phone looks amazing the touch and hold feel is excellent display sound quality is more than excellent battery doesnt get charge fast it takes time even with the fast charger and lasts upto hrs of continuous use on full charge the phone has an heating issue it warms up a bit the gb ram isnt worth the feel the camera quality is just ok for a camera guy or a selfie lover this phone is a big no the build quality is good and worth spending k
13569,1.0,in this phone u cant search contact with middle consecutive numbers its easy in samsung camera is week its not at all good dont buy this phone just looking at mega pixcel quality is worst in low light
13570,4.0,excellent phone in this budget i would suggest to buy this phone the features are amazing just like mah battery and samsung has also changed the ui of the system performance wise amazing phone
13571,4.0,i was disappointed in the blue color of this skirt i was looking for white also felt it ran a little big
13572,3.0,it works well
13573,4.0,loved everything overall except that the battery life sucks ps go for a newer version if you can afford
13574,5.0,just loved this phone performance battery life etc is awesome but speaker quality cannot beat the s series of samsung in terms of loudness clarity and bass
13575,1.0,my phone stopped working suddenly and when submitted they says it has water damage so its not covered under warranty or insurance plan when submitted to apple store they say contact amazon for insurance even after buying such costly phone with insurance we only have option to buy new one if its hardware damage and they simply give report which says water detected even after claiming its water proof
13576,3.0,its fun for about or minutes until you realize theres far more it doesnt know and cant do to be truly useful however im sure they are slowly but surely making it better hopeful that will happen and make it more of a userfriendly device
13577,4.0,i wanted to love this the color in the picture is pretty truetolife the top fit well if a bit smaller than usual but the skirt piece was way too flared for my petite frame it was too voluminous compared to the top of the dress the material is very soft but thin and is lined which was a pleasant surprise sadly a return for me
13578,1.0,ive had the card for over a month using it in my samsung galaxy note i filled the card with a few tv shows and movies to watch on the go as well as many pdfs and ms word docsthe ms word and pdf files often get corrupted after use the larger files seem to stay intact i moved the smaller files into the internal storage and havent had problem sinceim hoping sandisk has a decent return policy
13579,1.0,not working properly mobile hang out battery back up is not good soon battery get discharged again n again have to recharge mobile get hang out no
13580,3.0,not so great its better to spent on iphone plus iphone has little change from s
13581,5.0,this shirt looked so perfect on the model and i was so excited to get it when i received it it was so soft and the color was so vibrant the only thing is its too big it kind of looks like a maternity shirt it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me but im happy with it other than that im normally a lxl but m would have been perfect this time
13582,4.0,i love anna suis lines makeup to everything this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on i couldnt see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big the hem is lovely scalloped each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress there is no wow that justifies the full price tag now that its on sale ill keep it probably for summer
13583,5.0,great works well no problems answers most questions wonderful for music if you have amazon prime
13584,5.0,one word amazing go for it without any second thought best for bedroom and small size living room
13585,4.0,fountain of inspiration if you read this novel multiple times it provides new insights each time
13586,5.0,it is a really good product in this price range it is better than other trackers in this range it looks sleek on hand which gives it a premium look
13587,2.0,my battery is not working inspite of charging it again and again before the battery went dead it was not even getting connected to the phone
13588,1.0,it is difficult to pair with mobilesome of items paired and other not even days passedtechnically not good to purchase
13589,4.0,received echo dot as a gift didnt know if wed really end up using it weve found a lot of uses for us including making lists setting up alarms and reminders playing music getting updates on weather and news etcour challenge right now is to integrate it with our music system so that we can easily play our favorites the speaker is not the best but if we find a way of integrating our usual speakers we may have found the solution to replace all the additional paraphernalia we have that complicates the sound system we currently have that keeps breaking down
13590,1.0,the phone is not working from yesterday how could a phone like iphone can be non working position without completing a year alao
13591,5.0,i love it everyone should have one i enjoy it very much
13592,3.0,i really loved the pattern on this shirt and the colors were nice too something a little different than a plain white shirt however it was a little boxy on me and the material was kind of stiff i am realizing that i am a sucker for soft material if this goes on sale i may purchase it again but i did end up returning the shirt
13593,1.0,over price
13594,1.0,voice not audible to the other caller as the voice compressed while talking on headset mic issue system update times within a month which occupies space and ram camera is also not good speaker sound burst while ringing tone low sound of speaker also only looking functions touchpad are good
13595,2.0,meh just ok bought for about at target for my year olds long thick slightly dry hair not great and not horrible you must use a good conditioner afterward we did not like the argan conditioner so we tried the coconut milk one not the coconut water one and did not like that either so far i am not impressed with organix
13596,2.0,please dont buy it
13597,1.0,this laptop is very poor quality
13598,1.0,sound is not good
13599,4.0,a little boxy a little short in the waist a little overpriced but the shoulder ruffle and the color are so flattering and in the mirror it just says summertime casual chic and cute
13600,5.0,good cameras good display best battery life amazing build quality fingerprint scanner is just ok but unlocking animation is little slow face unlocking is also good overall good phone
13601,2.0,i probably should have gone with petite this dress was just awful on the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be it hits me about thigh level its very unforgiving clingy and shows every bump i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy its going back
13602,3.0,this hoodie is beautiful soft and flattering but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and its probably going to look ratty after a few washings i might accept pilling in a sweatshirt but not at this price i dont really want to take it back but i will ive complained to retailer employees in the past about other clothes pilling and poor quality and theyve always said i could bring it back
13603,3.0,i love this dress the design is gorgeous however the bust is extremely small only someone in the a or b range will fit into their appropriate size i am disappointed
13604,5.0,good and delivery boy is also good
13605,5.0,ive been looking for a new winter dress and this one fit the order its warm yet flattering and i love the color
13606,3.0,im quite satisfied with battery life even the performance is also nice but the worst feature of this phone is camera despite of having mp triple camera the image quality is not up the mark and on zooming the deatils are also missing mp samsung senor cant compete with sony impx sensor used in iphone i cant say anything about selfie camera because worst worst worst as the photos are really really soft it could be better if there were no selfie camera at last mp camera is a biggest myth about this phone
13607,3.0,pages are loose
13608,4.0,great way to listen to amazon music and latest news updates my family fears were being eavesdropped on but alexa assured us she doesnt work for the government just amazon
13609,5.0,super cute style but runs slightly larger then other ag jeans i have
13610,4.0,i just purchased this top in the store it is definitely not tunic length as shown here but rather hip length also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size but it is adorable
13611,1.0,i loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store i am with a slender build i tried my usual xs but couldnt manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline the band is so small even fully stretched out i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder i gave up after wrestling with it i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking mefunny but not funny
13612,2.0,i love this jump suit sorta looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin i washed it and its still happening when you put your hand in your pockets they come out blue knees are blue thighs etc i looked dirty by the end of the day wish i could return it fit and look great not great after wear
13613,4.0,the fingerprint reader is a little laggy and there seemed to be some problem woth the earphone jack other than that great phone at this pricethe screen experience and battery life are great
13614,1.0,not so good phone kindly return it not satisfied in this price also not in that range very poor in all except battery refund the money
13615,1.0,so disappointed beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange loose and baggy through the top and midsection but tight around the buttock and thighs
13616,2.0,it has no google search it cant connect to google chrome directly who uses bing not since netscape
13617,1.0,i would not even give star to this product within months it had battery issues and even after replacement its not working properlyone side not working on top of that these people wont respond to your call or call you back and dont even respond your mails worst product with worst service
13618,1.0,sim not working processing very slow
13619,4.0,book is upto my level n about amazon services its best
13620,1.0,camera quality is not good
13621,4.0,like but not good back rear camera
13622,1.0,my motorola droid razr maxx hd works fine with a gb sandisk card but the gb card died in less than months sandisk will replace the card under warranty but the sandisk customer support team informs me that the replacement process takes about a month for two months the card worked flawlessly and then it started to have intermittent errors i thought it might be a problem with my phone so i tried a gb card and i never had a problem when i returned to the gb card the intermittent problems returned and got worse eventually the card completely died and it is no longer recognized by either my phone or my computerconnected card reader both windows and my phone now act as if no card were inserted even when its well seatedi plan to update this when i have used my warrantyreplacement card for three months but that will be at least four months from now
13623,1.0,not expected sound specially bass other speaker is available in the market they are better than jbl i suggest not purchase
13624,1.0,gb will give you for storage really value for money you can buy class sandisk instead of class samsung class sony for the same price transferring speed is good not as much as class sony but less amount so its ohk
13625,4.0,thank
13626,3.0,nice but some improvement needed
13627,4.0,i ordered the peach version in size xl it fit true to sizematched the photos online i hand washed it and it did shrink a bit the fabric knit used are so soft the color is so pretty too
13628,2.0,this was a decent product in all honesty it really didnt do much for my dry coarse thick frizzy short hair i felt as if it just added another thick layer rather than doing anything the same goes with the matching conditioner it didnt even help with frizz but rather just another built up layer this product doest not make your hair straight it only makes it slightly smooth and thats about it it smells decent but its really just one of these eh shampoos and conditioners
13629,2.0,no gst tax invoice received
13630,2.0,this conditioner isnt bad but its not amazing either i bought it for fred meyer because i really liked the smell and the ingredients seemed good too but after using up the bottle it didnt do anything special its just an average conditioner that smells pretty yummy i might buy it again but probably in a different scent
13631,3.0,embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos took a chance any way came out disappointed because i couldnt zip up the bodice i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material recipe for disaster i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size my back is too wide for the p for reference im d
13632,2.0,i wanted so badly to love this dress but i couldnt get past the thin material that you can actually see through not for this price anyhow the dress is shorter than i had anticipated and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isnt accurately portrayed in the photo on the positive though the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning but alas will be returning
13633,3.0,not worthy i brought this device after watching a lot of reviews about the okaish display but all i care about is great cameras but when i got the phone it was a horrible experience using this device the major drwback of this device is its screen its feels like i am using a tft display phone comming to the camera part i know it clicks good picture but all in vain as you couldnt reviews your photos earlier i have a mi a which also had a good camera and a good screen too but mi a has a better camera than mi a still to me mi a photo quality on mi a felt better than mi a photo quality on mi a overall i suggest you not to invest in this phone its just a waste of money
13634,1.0,proximity sensor not working properly there are major security issues with this phone there are zillion mi apps which cant be uninstalled and they keep running in background sending data stopped using it
13635,4.0,improve camera quality
13636,2.0,this jacket looked adorable on it was also quite comfortable however it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched sadly this is a deal breaker for me
13637,3.0,first of all i would like to say that its noise cancellation property is worst sound quality is like okk but not too good bluetooth connectivity is not good as it only covers feet distance
13638,1.0,this echo dot only lasted for months and then it broke not happy
13639,4.0,this phone ger hanged when i changed camera rear to front camera rest of all features is ok pictures quality is too good you can say awesome battery back up good everything apart from this problem is excellent
13640,2.0,it is worse mobile as it heats continuously and creating pain in head during call when consulted samsung they said to check in safe mode it was persisting in safe mode too when i tried returning the item amazon denied saying it cannot be returned but only replaced with similar item after am having some test through blancco app the app measures temp as deg max but believe me it is very hot and emanates radiation while calling i am a sufferer and nobody is listening this phone is a big disappointment for those who crave for aesthetics its a bulky phone and very thick and not so comfortable in handand a bit heavier too i wish it were sleek and lighter features are out of the world as display battery camera and ramstorage is incomparably superb another lacuna is type c charging cable as it is not universal charging is also not so fast took more than hours to get charged
13641,4.0,i love this tee and am a picky tee person it runs big the striped colors are even bigger but i washed in warm and dried them and they are great super soft and sexy for a tee i bought the xxs and i am lbs and i like the longer length cute with leggings not stars due to stretched out arm holes
13642,2.0,there are too many complicated steps one has to take in order to customize the echo dot as opposed to the google
13643,5.0,love the colors and pattern i am normally a ml i ordered a large as thats all they had in stock and it fits fine though the medium would probably have fit a little better for me it is very long even for me and im
13644,1.0,product is so bad dont know why amazon sends each time different quality products phone day by day giving new trouble on usage it works well till the returnreplace period ends slim slot not working currently phone hangs oftenscreen quality is bad
13645,2.0,super soft fabric however very short in the stride i ordered an xl normally wear i had to return it
13646,5.0,like design display oreo out of the box nice selfie shooter card slots dislike bettery life no curved glass no dual g volte charging cable so small
13647,4.0,nice product very clear sound only the sound is a bit low some times you will feel it must needed to increased
13648,1.0,worst ever product total waste of money start hanging within a month of purchase
13649,1.0,its only months that i have owned this so called smart tv it hangs like anything i have registered two complaints already the hanging problem did not got resolved and now the bluetooth remove and google voice assistant is not working dont waste your hard earned money on such chinese products the technician told me that its a mother board error and now i have issue with the remote
13650,1.0,not good product average product only use for kids no network connection accebulity
13651,4.0,this dress is a great weight and its very comfortable im glad i tried it on when i saw it in the store i probably would have passed it by online great detail lined and not seethrough im and lbs and its still the is still a little baggy but that is the style of this dress
13652,1.0,this is the worst phone ive ever seen battery is completely useless out of times the touch doesnt work useless features
13653,2.0,it doesnt clean my fine greasy hair well the next day after using it my scalp is itchy my hair is limp i love coconut water from organix but argan oil seems to be to heavy im disappointed
13654,2.0,i was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired it fits tts length is finethe inside is some but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap kinda canvas feeling the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way it also is on the thinnish side it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm this is definitely going back
13655,2.0,the fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy it was too flimsy the arms were too wide and overall for this dress didnt cut the mustard im the dress was long enough just didnt flow very well
13656,3.0,product is goodbut there is no cover receive with it as it is given in discriptionalso there is no warranty card
13657,3.0,this product is good quality and battery backup is good
13658,4.0,if you happen to get a size that fits you you will love these leggings they are true to size when the quality control works i got pair both in size one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans the material is very soft and comfortable also not sure who named these colors but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple
13659,3.0,not upto the mark honor may solve out those problem in its camera video features otherwise its really a bad deal
13660,4.0,looking at the pics of the product i couldnt guess the size thinness n etc when it arrived i saw the body n it amazed me as i didnt expected such thin size n less weight rich look phone about features phone battery is nice camera is decent not amazed me at that level happy with my purchase
13661,5.0,use full
13662,4.0,cooler than i expected definitely living in the future
13663,4.0,review on mi application is filtered so i depends on amazon reviews only the product is good in its price range you can buy inly for rs camera ok screen ok lag some heavy application voice clarity very bad sound clarity average picture clarity veery good touch response not greatscreen brightness very goodring tone loud and ok call drop is faced
13664,4.0,not good product during call my phone comes on loudspeaker directly without pressing loudspeaker option
13665,4.0,problem even in full call volume the sound is not clearly audible sometimes hotspot doesnt work properly note pro is launched at lower prices with higher features good screen battery processor camera all are great except above
13666,1.0,wifi not working picture quality not good upon technician visit he submitted wrong report worst amazon service ever
13667,1.0,the earphone stops working after several days so dont buy itthe colour i got was white when i asked for blueif you buy it make sure you have the bill with you otherwise it cannot be exchanged or repaired at jbl service centre
13668,1.0,please dont buy this product it is not working more than months my brother and me both purchased this item within a months gap both of us faced same issue unable to find return option also in amazon
13669,2.0,its a average phone because screen is very suspicious to dance there are lags while using it for multiple app the finger print scanner us also ok in slightly mositure condition it wont work
13670,4.0,good to buy i loved it personally
13671,3.0,redmi is nowhere near redmi note pro please note that performance of gb ram and fb storage of redmi is below average
13672,1.0,fuddu phone
13673,3.0,the blazer is boxy and less dressy that it seemed online i could only really wear this in casual situations and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work as well it does have an interesting hemline the shoulders are a bit too narrow for me but i do have shoulders on the broader side i dont hate it but i dont love it either but it is interesting enough that im going to keep it i ordered a small
13674,1.0,bad phone
13675,2.0,the only reason behind purchasing this was the step counting and to my utter disappointment its pedometer is faulty it counts the handwrist movement as steps i am really sad that even after spending so much it did not serve my purpose please dont waste your money pacer app on mobile is far more accurate than this wasteful gadget
13676,4.0,camera is average but battery backup is good
13677,5.0,i bought this phone in the exchange of my old phone redmi rs exchange price thanks amazon for extra sbi credit card discount so finally i got this phone in rs price i am reviewing this phone after days of hard usage phone is awesome start with pros display mind boggling love the super amoled displayvery much better than ips displaywatching videos is so pleasing my eyes battery its really on go monster massive mah must say really great battery just loved it rear camera superb hd quality like dslr in nightit also did a brilliant job great picture qualityand after on the flash light its capture best clear and coloured photosbut really a great camera qualityi am very happy to choose this phone thanks samsung audio quality in mm jack mind blowing performance smoothly gameplaypubg play with hdr in highest settings fingerprint reader smoothly work face unlock did a great job call quality is very good and clear cons built quality not up to the markback is made out of plasticso when u press the side of the phoneproduce some crackling sound so please buy a back cover for safety front camera not good but also not that bad in daysunlight capturing clear photosin night not like as mp its like mp i think its better in my previous phone redmi but could be better in next updates app lock no inbuilt applock like my redmi i hope its fix in the updates but still not happy back cover should be provided in the box phone speaker is not that goodits produced very thin sound which i dont like the amazon delivery is too good got my phone exchange smoothly thanks samsung
13678,3.0,rating overallused it for days and below are my views likes premium look display is fantastic battery backup is outstanding app performance is adequate dislikes ui is not good it takes few seconds to place a call and takes longer time to disconnect network reception is not upto the mark when compared to other phones which i had used in similar price range
13679,4.0,good product but the echo is way better why will to start its not too loud yes you can hook it up to a speaker but then whats the point if you can just spring in more money for a echo
13680,4.0,this is a good phone at this prize fresh recognition is not good everything else is fine

13682,3.0,i prefer my galaxy s plus this is a lovely phone but a bit too small especially once youve used a phone like the s battery life is disappointing if youre after slick and compact this is the phone
13683,2.0,mobile too much expensive as par as working condition its hanging even after one week of purchase mobile is little bit weight comparing with oneplus t which is extraordinary and oneplus is not good and not thin
13684,2.0,looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me just for comparison and i wish all reviewers would include this i am and weigh pounds i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater unfortunately i have returned it
13685,5.0,i feel in love when i tried it on im an usually have to hem long dresses but this on fits perfectly its full length on me its shorter on the model but i think it looks better full length and its a gorgeous burgundy soft and comfortable cant wait to wear it

13688,2.0,the skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip even though it has a built in slip it is still see through the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt if it wasnt see through i would keep it

13721,3.0,i really like how this looks on the model but in real life this top is much tighter i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes i returned it a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her so best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips

13723,5.0,awesome product worth buying if in budget camera and battery are great lasts around hours on heavy use display is great too colours look really rich

13726,4.0,this book explains its content in a very simple language and one shouldnt have any problem in understanding what is delivered overall this book justifies its title
13727,2.0,i usually only comb my hair in the shower when i have conditioner in it i was unable to run the wide tooth comb through my hair with this product in it i think i was tricked by the name and the pretty package around the time i started using this product i also started breaking out on my hairline on my neck and a few spots actually on my scalp i only use this conditioner once a week and also changed my regular conditioner so it may be that i dont believe this product is worth the money

13731,1.0,i was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model overall i would of kept it if it were much less money for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style
13732,1.0,i can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces so when i saw this sweatshirt online i ordered it right away its adorable and quirky however when i received it in the mail it reminded me of something my grandma would wear the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing if this was a more tailored sweatshirt i would be keeping it but sadly its going back
13733,4.0,please give headgear
13734,5.0,there is nothing i dont like about this speaker it produces deep and clear sound good speaker to use indoor good looking and most importantly great sound quality for both music and movies the only thing it lacks is that it isnt waterproof

13739,3.0,i use this with the tea tree mint conditioner and get decent results it makes my hair especially shiny and silky when i blowdry and straighten on days that i dont use teatstyling products though i think the shampoo makes my hair a bit dry it works better when used before using heatstyling products also it doesnt do much for dandruff i bought the tea tree in the hopes that it would reduce dandruff as tea tree is known for helping to maintain healthy scalp i like the organix products but i think after i use up the bottle i will try another shampooconditioner overall i would recommend if you blowdry and straighten frequently

13746,5.0,prodect
13747,3.0,i so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful colorbutthe fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips first the fit the arm pits are low and dont actually tuck into where your armpits are so you have this weird restriction in arm movement then the design is not great either and others mentioned this the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi
13748,5.0,as soon as it was inserted into the samsung galaxy s it started getting filled up in a trip to nyc it is great not having to empty photos and music off the phone and the phone still works fast which is good considering sd cards with apps tend to make android phones slow great quality from sandisk
13749,5.0,super good
13750,5.0,good configuration and look
13751,4.0,charging stops without fully charging the mobilehave to disconnect again connect for few times for full mobile charging good for carry battery life is strong
13752,1.0,started hitting too much
13753,2.0,life is what you make it going by book title did not expect it to be a novel amazon should have mentioned it as fiction
13754,2.0,i ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top while they are the same price they arent even close in quality this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen the trim pocket and the laceup tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didnt lay right and the tag sewn inside was sewn with red thread and showed through very visible i don t think it would hold up after many washes i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev
13755,5.0,amazing sound quality
13756,1.0,product was damaged and amazon not providing replacement
13757,4.0,it looks neat and works good
13758,1.0,i guess the product i have received is not original one the quality of the pages is so cheap like photocopy
13759,3.0,i really wanted to love this dress but it just wasnt flattering on me i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman but it was pretty shapeless on me it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless but it didnt work for this short
13760,2.0,not satisfied with the product communication is not proper very difficult to hear voices to callers very low voice heard need to resolve this issue
13761,3.0,overall nice device but network issue is there in this device same sim cards was using on mi phones give better network coverage but in this device network coverage is so pathetic
13762,5.0,ms seems to be a very good product the cameras are great and gives us a very good output the mp shot needs the camera to be steady and give a frame no degradation on zoom battery lasted days with youtube games and watsup all going the graphics are better and played pubg with high frame rate set the hdr some times does gives slips
13763,3.0,this top is a tough one i ordered my usual medium im lbs c and wear a m pretty much all the time tops and bottoms lets begin the bad when i tried it on i found the bust to be too small and the darting on the sides puckered in a very nonflattering way the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck which is not my scene also the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray the good the pattern is adorable the sleeveless design would be great under bl
13764,3.0,this top is gorgeous in person but when i tried it on i fell out of love it didnt happen immediately but the more i wore it around the fitting room area the less i appreciated its beauty i tried it on in an xs i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops lbs for reference this top is just huge in the body the fit is very boxy and just not flattering yes it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggos this was just a miss for me
13765,1.0,i tried this shampoo a couple of months ago because i heard that tea tree oil and peppermint oil helps if you have oily hairscalp when i tried it though i was very disappointed it didnt decrease the oil in my hair and even worst it didnt clean well at all after air drying i could see what appeared to be white dust in my hair if youre looking for something in the organix line i would recommend the acai berry avocado shampoo its great
13766,2.0,sound is low
13767,4.0,accessories that were promised were not delivered the parcel contains only the phone the charger and the sim ejector pin headphone were not found in the box
13768,4.0,the loudness of sound is not as much as expected from a sony product tried using an aux cable as well as bluetooth but overall a good product bluetooth connectivity is good sound quality and clarity is good could have been louder
13769,2.0,notch display very bad in terms of scratches made by nails of finger
13770,1.0,shape of the watch
13771,1.0,i want my redmi pro it is not at all
13772,3.0,i bought this for a galaxy note and while it functions properly it is completely useless for my tablet i cant put movies or books on it because they are streamed from google play and i cant put apps on it because that is not allowed why do they put a micro sd slot on a tablet that cant use it for anything but backups backups i might add that are already in the cloud amazon did a great job delivering it which was a bright spot in the realization that i spent dollars on a chip that is going to do a better job cleaning the dirt out of my grout than helping the memory on my tablet
13773,5.0,this is the best product from apple till date the promotion offers has a reduced price to approx k which is bang for buck go for it if you want an iphone
13774,4.0,and runs large im always a size in dresses and the was too big i would buy it in a if the color was closer to what im seeing online
13775,4.0,love this blouse it has great coverage but is very light yes it is a bit sheer but with a nude bra you cant tell at all so its great for needing to look professional on hot summer days the structure at the bustwaist creates a very flattering shape and i love the bronze gold buttons with the black pattern i got a usually a but every once in a while i need to size up and couldve possibly gone with a but am happy with the freedom of movement i have with the arms with the ove
13776,2.0,this oversized sweater is lightweight and scratchy i knew it would fit big but the neck is overly bulky the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture fits a little larger on me than on the model im petite so it overwhelmed me
13777,4.0,im a fan of organixthere has only been one product i didnt likethis treatment is very moisturizing and makes my hair so soft and healthy lookingi do think they have better scents than this oneit does smell like the seai also like that its in a squeeze tube instead of a jar u dip fingers in organix doesnt have sulfates and i think it makes my hair look better when i use their line
13778,2.0,erratic performance
13779,3.0,star in features star lenguages does not speak spanish
13780,4.0,love the design its screams retailer and is form fitting flattering and super cute however the material has the itch factor for me its not lined and therefore quite scratchy along the collar as well what a shame
13781,4.0,for samsung ms gb ram pros at rs k price you get gb ram gb internal with gb expandable by memory card camera quality is good just change some default settings like beauty skin mode with unnecessary smooth your face in selfies max image resolution etc mobile is sleek and comfortable to hold and lightweight too wide angle camera powered with mp lens is also good i have posted daylight photo nd is nightmode on photo while rd one is captured with auto image enhancements mode th is simple ratio mp mode of light lanterns on evening battery part is very impressive here you get mah battery which lasts upto and half day for me i use only google chrome use whatsapp telegram and youtube and others use upto hours perday screen on time which lasts upto hours backup screen is super amold display powerful processors packed with octa core works at ghz max samsung ui based on android offers you split screen pop up app features you can use apps simultaneously on screen cons samsung has provided always on display option but when i tap it and activate still my display fails to remain on and turns off at its time of sec while using camera with night mode you will get grain and noise device comes with w fast charger only still you can use w or w type c wall charger by others brand rest is all good at this price range because its samsung atleast you can expect user safety along with data privacy over that huwei xiomi and all chinese brands
13782,3.0,i was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral unfortunately the shape is a line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering so it will be returned
13783,2.0,dont give information as the name indicates it does not discloses as it shows
13784,1.0,she wont listen to me when i say to stop the alarm do not buy this crap
13785,1.0,this card has crashed i am unable to write or delete anything on this card
13786,4.0,this top is very flattering on my torso my problem area the sleeves are adorable and i love the navy with purple tints and the touches of gray i would say this product could work on most body types its very comfortable and i could wear it for a long time i would suggest considering a smaller size than ones normal size but i would look into both sizes and see which one you prefer i ended up getting my regular size because i just liked the way it looked better
13787,4.0,this top is cute it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy as another reviewer pointed out the peplum is only in the front it sounds really weird but i dont really mind the look because ill be wearing a jacket over it im usually a size with a dd bust and the large fits beautifully
13788,5.0,good smart tv but wall mount requirement not fulfill
13789,4.0,maxi dresses are always my summer staple and moss has been my favorite wardrobe color lately so this dress was a must buy im petite and this came about two inches above my feet i would be cautious if youre more chesty i wear a c cup and typically am a at retailer but the extra smalls bust line didnt hit under my bust properly and was too high up im hoping sizing up will fix the problem if the small comes back in stock online besides sizing issues on my part this dress was nice and
13790,4.0,this is a really cute sweater its thick enough to keep you warm but it just didnt look right on me it made me look frumpy
13791,2.0,the design of this dress was very off for my lb d frame its lowcut and tight in the bust but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips making me look wide there a belt didnt help much the fabric is nice but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy
13792,5.0,color style adjustability easy fit flattering yes on so many levels oh wait its on sale fantastic magnificent and pretty i bought medium and in
13793,4.0,good book for english vocabulary
13794,4.0,very smooth touch screen but battery life is not upto the mark and camera quality also but is very good for gaming and sensor also very smooth
13795,4.0,best speaker for its price great sound quality good fm bluetooth connectivity update after about months of usage its battery began to deteriorate i have started to see that its battery is lasting only for hrs or so rather than hrs i looked inside it and found out that its battery is of mah i think i need to upgrade the battery to mah so that i get long playback time it also has only one speaker not two anyway it is a nice speaker
13796,1.0,camera is good but i dont know mp and ram detail hanging problems gb ram but phone is slow daily hanging
13797,2.0,i am hoping that if i keep giving this a try i can love it as much as the other reviewers do as of this review i will say to its benefit my hair turns out nice usually when i use it however every other part of this i dont like i found myself cringing when it was time to wash my hair with this why do i dread it so much here is why fyi i have fine amp wavy to curly hair scent at first i told myself it was quotfreshquot but then when i was using it all i could think of was the reviewer who compared the scent to industrial bathroom cleanerand the more i used it the more that is exactly what it smelled like to me washing with it i have used tons of sulfate free shampoos so it isnt just thati know how to make sulfate free stuff work this stuff just had no viscosity it would not quotworkquot into my hair or leave the crown feeling clean it didnt even get the one tangled dirty spot i will always get to loosen and because the poor viscosity it tore out caused hair to break so much more because i had to work so hard to get it all around my head to clean when i rinsed this out i always needed to rely on conditioner to untangle that spot that gets tangledit was literally matted up like a fur ball next day hair i found my hair getting oilier faster than usual at the scalp when i used this so getting second or third day hair was very hard so if i figure out a way to love this stuff and i want to because it is dirt cheap i will update and change right now i prefer the gvp generic for biolage color care old version lanza healing moisture or ag smooth or colour savour
13798,1.0,remote stopped working in months dont waste the money on buying this you cant buy remote separately
13799,5.0,works exactly as you would expect it to sandisk always makes great products that are of high quality highly recommended
13800,1.0,while ordering the phone i thought that it would be good even after viewing some of the negative reviews specially about cameras but the phone disappointed me also in more aspects first more than battery drains out within hours without doing any heavy task just upgrading apps and device second processor is not up to mark i played dancing lines and it suffered while running earlier i had redmi note pro which ran the game very smoothly third as in most of the reviews camera quality is not good as specified it is first time i made a very bad choice the specifications are only in papers not in real life
13801,3.0,seems to work good in my gopro have only had it a few days and if i have problems with it in coming months i will update this for not it works
13802,3.0,poor battery backup and acessories not good
13803,5.0,tv clarity and smart features are good thanks to amazon and google for coming down with the rivalry and allowing casting of prime videos
13804,3.0,very nice produced
13805,5.0,best mobile in this rate and pictures quality is very nice and low rate nice pics in this rate
13806,4.0,the mobile is really good camera is not up to the mark still no issues with the performance overall nice budget phone worth buying it hope in future i will not regret buying this phone and amazon delivery was pathetic i am a prime member i got the mobile after days
13807,2.0,mobile came with open seal usually mi phone comes completely packed and you need to open the polythene wrap and then seal i am still satisfied with its performance but was expecting non tempered mobile this was mine first from mi i bought one more for my wife note pro and packaging was good as mentioned above updated review mobile speaker has stopped responding within months of my purchase i will change rating from to
13808,3.0,i received this dress today for a june wedding i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it it runs very big i normally like to wear items a bit biggerbaggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides bummer
13809,4.0,these are some of the cutest jeans ive seen in a while i ordered my usual size and they were too big im and about lbs i always were a i reordered the though and they fit perfectly the only disappointment was they make my butt look flat and emphasize my stomach which isnt the case in other jeans i think its due to the high waist they fit almost like a pair of pants oh well im keeping them i tucked in a striped sailor tee and they looked adorable
13810,4.0,awsome phone and exactly the same as per the description in the amazon site thanks amazon
13811,4.0,i love this as a loungeathome top the colors and pattern are really pretty its soft and warm very comfy and cozy but its also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut
13812,1.0,defective
13813,3.0,getting slow after months
13814,3.0,mi a provides you complete stock android experience pros and cons that i noticed are as follows pros camera is the main highlight of this device build quality is very premium provides you complete stock android experience and runs latest updates with security patches physical led notification light ir blaster cons display is sort of dim no mm audio jack battery backup is below average if you are a heavy user you may need to charge it twice a day ram managmenet is not that good device lags at some places proximity sensors are not that responsive only single speaker but the voice is crisp and loud final verdict considering the price point mi a is a good device but not best of all it has equal pros and cons but the cons mentioned above may not bother everyone so i say if you are tight on a budget and want a simple smartphone go for it as it provides premium android like google stock os thanks hope it helps
13815,4.0,fp is bit slow but camera is superb in android so dont update to as camera quality will decrease as many user complains about this smooth and fast charging is good
13816,3.0,this skirt is very pretty but i think it runs very large i am a size xs in retailer my waist is inches pounds the skirt is touching the floor even if i wear high heels i will have to wear it up my waist the elastic band is weak not sure if it will hold the skirt it should be ok with a belt i still recommend it cause its so pretty
13817,4.0,reviewing this phone after month of usage good ram management good camera but not in low light aperature mode is available only for back camera battery life is very good and balnced display is bright and eye care mode is good good processor
13818,2.0,this product is very very small in size and is hardly of any use for a common household family may be good for hotels only tried to replace it back from a bigger product but amazon refused to do so summing up my experience its better to purchase electronics items from local shops
13819,3.0,gave it stars because i dont know if the problem is the card or the phone i have an intermittant problem where the phone stops recognizing it but its fast and holds a lot i would recommend itupdate had intermittant issues with my phone galaxy s finally gave up the ghost completely computer wont recognize it at all i dont think i had any important data on it i would take it up with sandisk as another reviewer indicated that they replaced his over issues in his phone but my computer cant even recognize it to wipe it so im not sending it anywhere
13820,2.0,it is a good amazon servant but does a very poor job on generic searchesprobably because of the inferior search capabilities of amazongoogle home does a much better job on that front

13823,3.0,i normally dont right too many reviews but i felt this one really needed some honest feedback when i first started using this shampoo i was hooked and it really seemed to work well for me i have very dry thin and brittle hair so i was looking for a sulfatefree product that would help tame my hair sulfatefree yes taming not so much it leaves my already quite dry and somewhat damaged looking hair just the same in other words not much change will probably not buy again when i run out of my supply

13836,3.0,it worked fine for less than a year thats about it so id suggest buying the larger echo andor pay for an extended warranty youll save money in the long term and make them pay for it when it breaks early even though all you do is leave it on your desk and use it to turn your lights on and offtheres probably a reason the extended warranty is for a device these things will break even my smart light bulbs come with a longer warranty and frankly they havent given me any trouble at all but this is exactly why i think amazon has done away with the limited warranty they offered on the first generation i get error messages such as and and customer support that basically tells me to do everything ive already done or try asking alexa to do specific things its pretty much uselessim a cs graduate and i know how to troubleshoot problem devices i can tell theres something either wrong with the dot or the server connection its having like perhaps its registered wrong or they messed something up or maybe even the firmware got messed up by a bad update while i was sleeping do any of my other devices have any trouble with the network no its the dot end of story especially after resetting everything perhaps the dots software isnt reliable but how hard is it to send packets over a network unless your network drivers and whatnot are janky not very

13863,1.0,ive always had problems with this brand of shampoo and conditioners after many times of trying different types of this product this has to be by far one of the worst for me i have very dry hair due to dying it and i was looking for a product that would replenish the moisture back into my hair and make it shiny again this did nothing for my hair except dry it out and leave it in knots i had to use half of my detangled bottle to get the nots out and to top that off to me the smell was not pleasant eitherit just smells like salt water and i personally do not like that scent but my hair is still dry and it wasnt this dry before i washed it with this shampoo i did use the conditioner after however this didnt do much because their conditioner was awful as too

13883,3.0,okay i love the blouse this brand has in the same material so i thought id delight in this dress i am a hourglass but have a longer torso i ordered the large in this usually a or fits me but the waist hit much higher than my natural waist and yet it was somewhat tight and completely rigid the bust area was a little loose and im a c then the bottom flared out in sort of a flower fairy poof above my knees which reminded me of a navy blue oompa loompa dress and i love my
13884,3.0,to all those saying there arent any warnings about the color changing quotit is recommended that a strand test in a discreet area be performed prior to application especially if you have light colored or chemically treated hair in isolated circumstances some may experience a discoloration of the hairquot straight from their website httpwwworganixhaircomcontentbktdaysmoothingtreatmentinstructions im pretty sure its on the box too but id have to double check since i dont have the packaging sitting in front of me anyway to my review ill have to update this since it hasnt even been a full hours yet the process while easy was time consuming i have hair that is fairly fine but thick so it looks normal but really theres a lot of it i cant do a thing with it unless i spend an hour or more blow drying flat ironing or curling which i hate and rarely do otherwise it just kind does its own thing it has a wave but its not well defined it goes to about the back of my bra strap so decently long a lot of times i dont even brush it since that just makes it worse every once in a while ill randomly get awesome sexy bed head hair but thats pretty rare i started kind of late at night and it took about hours total and i know i way over saturated my hair by accident took forever to blow dry and now it feels a little on the icky side although my coworker says it looks perfectly fine i used my t hairdryer and my chi falt iron i think my chi only goes up to but my hair is very straight at the moment but i am counting downt the hours until i can wash it in a couple of weeks when i have a better idea ill update this review

13887,4.0,this is a topflight notch an attractive design nicely made for me the fabric is rather heavy for summer wear but that wont prevent me from keeping it for cooler days my one complaint is the sizing i weigh a bottomheavy lbs and hoped id get away with a medium but it swims on menot a bit too large but way too large im returning it and hoping that a small will be small enough
13888,1.0,i bought this product on th dec and started using from th jan for the remembrance of pongal within days camara is not working we have gone to secunderabad service station till today th feb we have not got either replaced or repaired i am a regular buyer in amazon
13889,4.0,i just got this top in store today all the colors were heathered pretty casual colors the top is extremely soft and i would say true to size love the flutter sleeves that give nice feminine details i hope it doesnt shrink in the wash and wears well also i found that the purple color seemed to run slightly smaller than the others kind of odd but i thought worth mentioning
13890,1.0,my dot became possessed with some kind of evil spirit after a few months and wouldnt stop the alarm regardless of any commands i shouted even after restarting the device it went right back to blasting the alarm as soon as it turned on and refused any commands youll notice this review is written in past tense because i smashed my dot with a crowbar and threw it out my bedroom window after too many mornings of waking up to this bs not good for my blood pressure i still have dots in other rooms and im just waiting for them to start getting fresh with me too
13891,1.0,not good prodkat

13893,3.0,pros good build clear voice for songs played on paired cellphone cons little too expensive for output provided bass is totally missing shudders when a song with slight bass freqs is played voice gets very low in case you want to hear ongoing conversion on a pared cellphone
13894,5.0,very good and more than its performance than expected awesome and delightful delivered in time by amazon team only after sale service has to be improved by mi company by providing proper field staff for verification of the item is in good in all aspects picture quality is very good only sound quality is to increased for more audiable

13898,5.0,this one is way better in person admittedly i put it in my basket only becasue it was on the stylists pickswell it is great a little sheer adn super staticy when i received it but oh so soft the plunge is a tiny bit low for my liking but this doentt come in petitesso i had to suck it up and keep the regular sie teh coloring is nice too neutral event htough there is rust and navy and greayish it stil lcan be worn with anything
13899,2.0,this top arrived today and after trying it on i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture the fit is designed to be loose so i dont think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down ive included a picture of how it fits naturally and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back its still a cute shirt just not the flattering top i was expecting im debating on

13901,3.0,i bought this dress for a wedding i have this summer and its so cute unfortunately the fit isnt perfect the medium fits my waist perfectly but was way too long and too big in the bust and shoulders if i wanted to spend the money i could get it tailored but i just felt like it might not be worth it side note this dress was delivered to me with a nordstrom tag on it and i found it much cheaper there after looking
13902,3.0,typical
13903,4.0,love our echo dot my year old can ask her questions all day long and alexa is more than happy to answer her saves my sanity
13904,3.0,i was so excited to try this on after having discovered it on the retailer app and stepping into the store and seeing it on the hanger it looked alright but once i slipped it on its like everything ive got going for me disappeared granted im s little bottom heavy so these types of dresses dont typically flatter my body type anyways
13905,5.0,i purchased this for my samsung galaxy llls i never have to worry about running out of storage capacity thousands of songs dont even make a dent
13906,4.0,i got the purple version in a xs i purchased it on sale so it was a great deal i usually dont wear large prints but i loved the print and the ruffle detail very feminine it also hides the tummy roll so that is always a plus ive worn it a few times and threads are already unraveling but easy fix
13907,1.0,same mobile battery is very poor continue down no backup
13908,2.0,quality is not good
13909,1.0,when streaming amazon music it constantly breaks up it streams pandora just fine but amazon music is always breaking up you cant trough one song with out multiple interruptions
13910,2.0,i purchased this product after watching many online review videos and trusting brand samsung that they must have improved their game in the last years since i abandoned them my overall experience is horrible the phone is terribly terribly slow it takes two seconds to unlock using the fingerprint scanner takes second to launch simple apps like messaging or whatsapp the rear camera blows everything out of proportion the colors lighting etc everything is blown out even an older device like iphone clicks much better and natural photographs the front camera is a farce it tries to hide its incompetence using artificial processing which means as soon as you zoomin the image gets distorted the display is awesome however the autobrightness doesnt works because there is no sensor at all it relies on front camera and by the time it sense the lighting conditions they have most likely changed notification options are too many and confusing could have been much simpler i mean why and the lock screen does not lights up whenever there are any notifications sometimes it will if it feels like even the battery is not awesome my poco f delivered much better battery performance in a mah battery and it takes forever to charge this battery using the supplied charger like forever
13911,1.0,phone got bend in pocket no damage to display phone is working fine but servuce centre rejected to cover it in warranty very bad service will never recommend mi
13912,4.0,sometimes its earpiece speaker not working
13913,3.0,the top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see its not at all in person made with what feels like hospital scrubsmeetscrisppoplin this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out think of a flared wide leg pant but as a shirt the sleeves have a similar cut as well i too am a c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you its s
13914,4.0,fingerprint sensor and faceunlock are really fastp is a beastdesign isnt that goodbut this phone is best at this price range

13917,4.0,i was intrigued by the yummy scent and picked both the shampoo and conditioner from walmart i love the shampoo but the conditioner is another storyi have short hair so my hair is pretty easy to deal with and it doesnt have any special needs either all i ask for in a shampoo is to cleanse my hair and scalp without making it a tangled messthis meets my needs and it makes hair washing a treat because it smells so so good
13918,3.0,it is quite slow laptop but still it good at this price
13919,3.0,if you ask the question in an unfamiliar way alexa doesnt know not very good sound other than that it is a fun toy

13922,3.0,sound is not up to expectation
13923,3.0,the fabric is so soft but it was too roomy in the top and miidsection so it didnt flatter my body
13924,3.0,i like the fabric and aesthetic of this top and really wanted to like it however i wish it were longer i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes but even the medium felt short and clingy however that might be because im curvy with a long torso so id definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online
13925,1.0,some times mobile screen blinking mobile has over heat at charging time and camera also have some problem if possible customer service number send me
13926,3.0,over all ratting gven
13927,1.0,genuinely one of the worst shampoos ive ever tried along with the conditioner from the same range it did absolutely nothing for my hair except make it feel like straw and leave it unmanageable it was almost impossible to get out of the bottle because its consistency is so thick and the scent is overpoweringly strong to the point where it actually gave me a headache i used it times then threw it in the garbage
13928,5.0,yes its the best oled k screen i have ever used till date also fastest one i think lg only has the most slimmest screen in the market at present other than sony i have gone through all the flagship models in sony samsung but this is unique of its kind soo slimmer than others and the webos is soo smooth and easy to use iam very very satisfied with its picture quality and sound dolby atmos its amazing to watch k movies avatarinterstellar easy to access apps like youtubeamazonprimenetflix etc if wifi or lan is speed u can enjoy the experience without any buffering or glitches in k this is tv for movie entuziasts who like to watch in high resolutions or uhd etc even very very fast while connecting hardisks tb or more than that bluetooth screen sharing and overall soo many more features are there to experience from it and enjoyits a superadvanced tv right now i can say i bought it on julyth from lg store for every penny u pay is worth it without any doubt u can go for it guys
13929,5.0,this top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms youre going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out its made of a light weight linencotton fabric its very soft and doesnt wrinkle as easily as most linen does it feels soft on the skin lightweight and has a nice bounce to it its
13930,5.0,my husband was thrilled with this especially upon learning the things to try included in the setup manual
13931,2.0,runs small im usually a size sm for retailer clothing for reference im lbs b the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size the size fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large pretty vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes
13932,3.0,i thought alexa would recognize and play songs when given the title and artist also there were quite a few questions she could not respond to
13933,2.0,everything is okk but size is too long
13934,2.0,maternity like and although the back is really cool there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwearpajama returned
13935,3.0,i purchased this shirt in a medium in the wine color i love the drape and fit of the shirt it has a laid back vibe and the material is supper soft and comfy it is also a bit more substantial than some of the thinner shirts ive bought at retailer you could easily dress this up or down i wore this shirt a couple times and then machine washed it on cold on a delicates cycle and dried it flat it majorly shrunk now i cant wear it because the length shrank at least an inch or more if you purc
13936,4.0,i was very impressed with the quality of the satin this top can easily be dressed up or down i purchased the white and love it the almost full zip back makes for easy on and off i ordered a medium and think it runs a little big
13937,2.0,the volume and bass is not very high as expected its a fine purchase not a satisfactory one
13938,4.0,suprb sound bass in this price segment
13939,2.0,netflix is not working
13940,2.0,the product smells ok but from the first time i used it my scalp itched and burned it just got worse with each use i had to throw it out after using it times
13941,1.0,product is not good at allvery slow processor and keeps on pause during videos watching on usb and smart feature are very laggy and sometunes hangs a lot
13942,2.0,not a good phone bad video and audio recording quality g speed is not upto standardbrowsing is very slow i like only the camera quality battery life
13943,2.0,i purchased this because i liked the list of ingredients which included jojoba seed oil whipped yogurt proteins silk mino acids panthenol avocado oil vitamin e glycerin and of course shea butter looked liked a lot of quotgood stuffquot packed into that little bottle smelled nice so im surprised that this made my hair feel the opposite of smooth quotgrittyquot and quotcrunchyquot even while still wet i usually comb out my shoulder length hair while still wet with conditioner and noticed this wasnt as easy to do as with others ive used before i had to tug to get the comb through my straight hair sorry to say back this goes
13944,3.0,one thing i really didnt like about my echo dot is that you have to have it always plug in to use it also the speaker is weak
13945,1.0,so disappointing everything ive owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time one wash and this was ruined shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry completely ruined returned it
13946,3.0,the shirt design is very nice but it fits very loose it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material
13947,2.0,i have very fine thin hair that breaks easily this did nothing to strengthen my hair i waited to give my review after using the entire bottle in case it needed to build up hair still breaks easily it wasnt a bad shampoo but nothing special i also went thru it very fast because it is a thick formula also the containers are annoyingly thick so you cant get it all out
13948,1.0,worst product send by the amazon
13949,4.0,overall good phone but if u getting in k

13967,3.0,the vest looks so stylish on it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on i love the vest but the price is too high
13968,4.0,this is very cute but i will have to size up my large to extra large and normally i wear a medium or large it is quite tight as a large it looks a lot cuter on the model so i am hoping the extra large does it

13973,2.0,i was so sad not to love this dress it is beautiful but is so unflattering on there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking so it just made me look incredibly frumpy i dont really think a petite would have helped the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang the dress sort of clumps i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem but i was super disappointed narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off it is a t

13997,3.0,i wish that it had fit me better as the feel of the fabric and the color were great regrettably i am sending it back as the v opening is too low for my tastes and the fabric on the left of the first layer drapes weird on me i am usually a s or m and in this top the s was plenty of length and room would be swimming in a m the fabric was soft and felt great against your skin and not thin as some fabrics can be the color was just as shown and beautiful hope it works for some of you out there
13998,1.0,something is wrong with it it periodically turns off and on it wakes us up in the middle of the night no problem with the other dot or echo we bought but this one is a dud sad face
13999,4.0,when i first saw this dress it honestly didnt catch my eye but as i kept seeing it in on the catalog and other places on pinterest i realized how unique this dress is i looked at the reviews and was surprised at how negative the comments were im the type of lady who gets stuck on something and wont get off of it until i try it for myself so i ordered it on sale and i love it it isnt flannel material and so i wasnt expecting this to be a dress that would keep me warm by itself but
14000,3.0,everything is good about the phone except the display camera battery performance and os are exceptional in this price rangebuyers can install the g cam mod to improve the camera performance display quality is very bad as it is a hd display and the size of the display is also bit smallthose who kind of like to frequently see videos and live tv please dont go for this because of the display

14008,3.0,i own the essential slims and love them so i figured i could order these in my normal size and theyd fit great i was way off they were uncomfortably tight in the calves which is understandable im a runner so my calves are disproportionately large and uncomfortable in the waist i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves t
14009,1.0,my hair is fine and gets greasy by the end of the day ive been using a shampoo to keep it from getting greasy and was looking for a conditioner to condition hair and keep it from getting dry the first few times i used this conditioner it did nothing at all for my hair and was entirely washed out when i rinsed my hair now i use alot of conditioner and it does manage to condition my hair a little but not enough to justify the price at the same time it does not strengthen my hair and i feel my hair getting finer and weaker by the day am waiting for this to run out so i can try another brand do not buy this product
14010,5.0,satisfied
14011,5.0,this was a good investment for my galaxy note i had to use the perseus kernel to swap the internal memory with this little guy so right now my phone reports internal memory of gb so thats great its good saving pictures full hd videos games etc
14012,1.0,very bad product i received a defective pc but no proper response from amazon they are just looting money by sending all refurbished handsets from the brand its a very big game plan by amazon
14013,2.0,this skirt is very short i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle thats quite off because im only feet tall and i wore it pretty low on the hips it also flares out awkwardly below the knee there are vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my year old cut up a skirt plus the fabricwhile thick and beautiful and stretchyhas a
14014,3.0,i wear a and sometimes a but i could barely squeeze these on in a the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean made for much thinner frames than mine
14015,3.0,i was so excited to see this yellow dress online but was disappointed with the color when it arrived the yellow us much darker than pictured i felt the dress ran true to size but if youre short you definitely want to go with petite sizes

14017,2.0,i loved this skirt so flattering and such a beautiful fabric unfortunately after only wears the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me literally i bought the right size and it was not too tight the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly very disappointing
14018,2.0,dont buy device heating up a lot while making and receiving calls it goes uptown degree celcius but amazon representatives saying that its normal and within acceptable limit imagine that how can it is possible to keep degree celcius warm device near your ear for about to min sometimes even more for longer call waste of money and device bad product from samsung and amazon how can a manufacturer itself can set a norms for their own device dont believe the advertisement samsung and amazon are cheating the people
14019,4.0,good product buttons given are very small so not suitable for elderly people though charging light is helpful to know the full charge
14020,5.0,i like it because i bought it
14021,3.0,the outer layer runs large up top also the orange stitching the flowers on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath im returning it because for the price i dont love it
14022,3.0,like a baby doll top with almost an empire waist going on feels comfortable and super flowy i got a size m and i swing between m and l in most brands the button stitching are a bit loose and will fray after some wears i can tell but im borderline on taking it back still because there are hidden side pockets crazylike it was a fluke or something would fit a piece of paper or tissues not keys or phones though
14023,1.0,not good not worth buying
14024,2.0,this dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailers aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silkjacquard fabric to give it texture which is how it looks from the photo obviously it would have been more expensive but in any case this was just a really expensive polyester dress which it says in the product description but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product itll be retailer but now i
14025,4.0,the product is quite good under my budget but the sound quality is not as what i have expected battery life is on and around and half hour to hour under constantly use of internet seems to be good product and under the budget most important to make a note on this product is that this doesnt have cddvd rom drive overall its a good deal
14026,4.0,it was just a replacement for my battery and the purpose has been well served with it do you wanna use it for a long run why dont you contemplate the mi mah power bank isnt it a better option with a slight cost difference only a suggestion to point it out
14027,1.0,dont be fooled by the photos online the color is a bright baby blue not pale blue its a beautifully designed dress however the material is so bulky and heavy its so unflattering i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true this dress just hung on me and pulled me down i wanted so much to love it but i returned it

14039,2.0,update i love the smell of this conditioner but sadly after a year of using it i am going to have to stop i will continue using the shampoo because i like that it doesnt contain sodium chloride sodium chloride in shampoo makes my hairline break out which is hard to find if you know of any please message me but the conditioner does not and i mean does not detangle my hair and i am tired of trying to comb through it forever after using this stuff sad but true folks

14043,5.0,very funny and interesting
14044,2.0,i actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt even with the xs size however i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section its so tight it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny as the top part is still loose i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem maybe just not for girls with thighs very strange fit
14045,3.0,these ran true to size but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving im athletic and have lean legs but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric i loved how they fit at the waist but the legs just didnt work for me sadly returning these
14047,5.0,a great piece of true knowledge
14048,3.0,redmi mobiles are always good but but expecting more memory at this price
14049,1.0,the product is not upto the mark
14050,4.0,i recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shownand is actually a nice touch to make these different the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips i wear a and the l is fine but i wouldnt want them any smaller super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute
14051,5.0,its good for your gk i love this book
14052,4.0,i love the print of this dress the deep blue really is striking i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore its hard to justify the price i cant seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering still on the fence it would be better as a sale piece
14053,1.0,it doesnt work very often occassionally it will answer one question like what day is this and then it wont answer anymore for days

14057,3.0,i love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work welp thats out the window this design is poor for one this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i dont know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite i have no torso so without a jacket i would never wear this its very low cutthe back is very lowits a little loose but i run between a and a

14076,3.0,i love this blouse on the model online however i couldnt get it to lay right and the material was a little scratchy for me did not like the glittery thread
14077,5.0,i dont usually spend this much on a top but despite the high price i really love the style i like that its made out of cotton and it can be worn down on the shoulders or left up looks cute both ways i ordered the xs which is usually my size it fits perfectly i imagine the s would have fit also it hits just at the hips i have a long torso so i would have liked it a bit longer but its not a deal breaker my one splurge this summerfor reference lbs d

14080,3.0,i think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i dont know how i would use this top i dont mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops if people see my bra slightly so be it but this is really sheer unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this and in my mind that defeats the purpose of a lightweight sleeveless top i returned it and was sorry to have to do that
14081,3.0,i didnt really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and im not really liking it its the rough unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well rough around the edges its a nicely cut great fitting sweater though so ill be looking for some scarves
14082,2.0,my fridge keeps viberating and making a loud noise
14083,2.0,first the good parts these are adorable in person and i think the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures the green isnt too army green its a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds whites blues pinksvirtually any color the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice they do seem to run a little large so id size down if youre between sizes and now sadly the bad these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a

14094,4.0,this tee is very pretty i purchased it in the greypurple combo i usually wear a medium in this brand just because i dont like my tees to be fitted but i found this one to be a little too loose for me so i should have sized down to a small

14096,2.0,i really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy it did not look flattering and will be going back
14097,1.0,the sound is too low that you will not hear the ring tone the problem mostly occurs if you keep phone down on table or some where similar my mom has been using the phone for past couple of days and she has not been taking any phone calls since then no one in the house is even hearing the sound to pick when ringing a was much better than a in terms of screen size even though the dimensions of a is bigger a has much better usability eg the back button which is placed in a vs a the photos videos app is too noisy that it confuse what we should do with it too much of tracking spam apps to advertise the apps are getting hanging you want to close the opened apps the ui is a mess no infrared feature as in a oh god your data is taken to china in the name of make in india i wonder why the government is allowing such things
14098,3.0,i was using iphones and moved to this phoneits slow display is bad if you are already using a good phone but thinking of change keep yourself away from this am writing this review after using for few months
14099,4.0,i ordered it for my younger sister and she is really happy with it specially with ear buds are really soft and gives comfort for hours long usage
14100,3.0,some of the offers like the screen replacement warranty card not provided despite repeated requests
14101,2.0,very basic extremely low volume doesnt have a built in battery to make it more portable has trouble understanding many commands theyll probably get it right on the th or th generation wasnt worth the
14102,4.0,i really like this top perfect underneath cardigans or on its own the fabric is a bit thin so light colors may be see through love the wider style so there is no bra show versatile i see myself purchasing more of these
14103,4.0,good product online cons is screen size is small atleast at this price it should be to inch
14104,1.0,left side of the headphones volume coming is very less not giving a complete bass experience the product is not recommended as bluetooth support is low the phone needs to be in nearest range itself i picked up from amazon coz i didnt expected a duplicate product like wht i hv gt
14105,5.0,i originally bought this jacket in a medium but the sleeves were a bit long and overall fit a little big i decided to exchange for a small and i am so glad i did this jacket feels great and the sleeves hit at just the right spot in the small size i normally wear a
14106,3.0,this is a ok product its basically a bad product but if you consider the price then you can somewhat justify it first of all cons are the screen quality isnt good the backlighting is very bad and uneven picture quality and colour reproduction isnt good most people buy a tv for watching contents but when the panel and picture quality two of the most important factors arent good enough you cant call it a good product pros the sound is very good nice design it runs on android its a huge bonus and till date i didnt have any lagging issues overall considering the price its not bad but not good either
14107,5.0,great art of story telling with great message
14108,3.0,performance of the phone is good but the material used for display manufacturing is not good cracks had developed on the screen
14109,1.0,very bad the mobile was not switched on iam so disappointed and the return option also not workingdont buy this product
14110,2.0,not so sastisfactory
14111,3.0,has bluetooth connectivity issues getting disconnected from phone even while updating
14112,4.0,this is a great item well made and heavier than it looks size runs sizes too small it is great as a dress or open as a long shirt with jeans i had my dressmaker put a dart right down the front under my breast to give a little more fit and less flare this helps if you are curvy
14113,4.0,finger touch is bed quality when not set finger but lock os open to other finger
14114,2.0,i adore the feel and cut of these culottes but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer picks piles and serious wear and tear after just one day i feel as if i wasted my money
14115,5.0,thank you amezone this is real product
14116,5.0,its excellent
14117,2.0,i bought shirts in gold black and red they arrived larger than expected after the first wash and air dry they shrunk i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash
14118,2.0,my alexa has lag in responding to remote not talking about voice response through the button itself its response is delayed everything else is fine
14119,1.0,this tv is totally useless i bought it on amazon sale and even though it says model half of the apps do not work because it needs to be updated when you go to app store to update it it says this version of android doesnt support the latest version picture quality is like p not full hd specially in netflix customer care is almost non existent sound quality is less than zero my old transistor sounds better than this just loud doesnt make it sound good the screws for mounting the table top stand werent provided i had to buy them from a nearby hardware store the worst part is now amazon wont take a return on the item they can only replace it spend a couple of extra bucks and buy a better branded tv
14120,3.0,love this top although it ran very small in bust and arms im normally a medium will have to return for a large
14121,4.0,im glad they put up some pix of nonmodels looking cute in this dress as its taken a beating in the reviews i measure a and have no problems with the size s fit at all its drapey but not voluminous with no pulling at the hips the folded detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders but not in a bad way the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest and the red patternpalette is awesome love the length too i am the size s hits me just above the knee
14122,5.0,i have both the samsung skyrocket and note android phones and this card works great mine came formatted for exfat android will need it formatted in fat to do this use the format function built into the phone after the format it works great
14123,5.0,this went into my new samsung galaxy light cell phone to store my music files and my cell phone photos zero problems these sd cards just work until the dont sandisk is a top brand and i have no trouble recommending this look through the many dozens of other recommendations too class uhs is one of the fastest protocols available currently
14124,4.0,camera is good but it could have been better
14125,5.0,this is absolutely satisfied delivery i got it in good price for a product which is worth more than it packaging was clean and professional bag provided with the offer surprised me it met above my expectations absolutely worthy bag which has adjustable partitions and is a multipurpose bag space good enough to carry additional lenses has the warranty in it and all that was mentioned with the offer im nikon a d owner hurray
14126,2.0,should have listened a previous review while this is a very well made garment it really does remind me of a bathrobe and will be returning too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great alsothis runs very large the extra small was more like a medium
14127,4.0,ok the title is misleading the monk who sold his ferrari i was curious to know how did a monk get a ferrari in first place its actually a big lawyer who sold his ferrari and became a monk nevertheless a good book to read can improve your life
14128,5.0,i love these jeans i have a few pairs of citizen jeans and like the way they fit these are a slim boyfriend jean not too baggy very flattering with any top loose or tight fitting wish retailer carried the white
14129,4.0,i loved this top and i normally order petites when im able to but this wasnt offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow it is a petite but its not just runs small i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternityish the way the bottom part flared out i actually thought it was a bit too short too even on me about lbs
14130,4.0,pros the amazing screen size and attractive notch screen most affordable phone under the samsung banner good battery life cons camera is pretty much average the specs mentioned is very high but the quality is usual slow finger print sensor no earphones included in the box you have to purchase separately only gb out of is accessible for users but overall i would say it is a decent buy you dont find phones under k in the market these days unless its chinese
14131,2.0,per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium it was still tight around the girls and im not that well endowed but too big in the armholes the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material i kept it because im lazy but not sure how much ill wear it given the strange fit
14132,5.0,thanks amazonfor such type of nice products
14133,2.0,over all product is not good looks like dummy
14134,1.0,value for money but poor battery pack up but its okay its depending on your usage but phone is lagging its not good for fast users
14135,3.0,screen quality ok ok
14136,5.0,when i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store it instantly caught my attention since it was pricey i didnt get it when it went on sale it ran out in my size so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for off the sale price this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt
14137,5.0,dude this phone is a beastu will love this phone
14138,1.0,this is a terribly harsh shampoo i wanted to like it as i prefer to use more natural products when possible but no this was a failure it is super drying to my hair scalp and skin it left my scalp super irritated and with a dry skin issue i dont typically have a manageability problem with my hair but this caused a dry and frizzy mess i have a lot of long fine straight hair not dry nor oily i wash every days for what its worth i dont find this shampoo even cleanses well the texture of the shampoo is a thick gummy gel which was rather unpleasant the scent was kind of fake smokeish too strong and unpleasant as well
14139,1.0,i use this product firsttime bluetooth connected after some time its not working i replace this product
14140,5.0,this shirt is so cute i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be as im not one for frills but the sleeves sit nicely also i am between a size small and medium i got the small and it definitely is flowy runs big so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down i got the red and its a perfect autumn winter color the cut outs are not too showy so its not revealing for us gals who are a little more bellyconscious its the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a
14141,2.0,heres an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term petite on it too much fabric was bulky and ran too small the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust returned
14142,1.0,worst battery life and worst amazon customer service
14143,1.0,i like nothing in phone
14144,3.0,well it does work and glad that it is not fake as you would get if you bought from other online stores at a piece but their max transfer speed is only at mbs not as advertised and i have a very decent desktop with usb connector
14145,4.0,very good product i am certified
14146,1.0,touch screen not work
14147,1.0,defective display black line and rectangular frame inside display dont buy note pro pro pro s and poco f from amazon because these mobiles are exclusively launched on flipkart
14148,1.0,every time i ask a question i get the same responseim sorry i dont know that
14149,5.0,this is the best phone i ever had picture quality sound quality face recognition is ultimate even in total darkness also it recognises me which is very surprising for me i enjoys watching movies match tv listening songs playing games clicking posting photos reading news books or article on it most important i can do my work on it i can use excel word also it allows me to install a number of softwares easily keep my data safe easy to use handel battery is excellent continue use remain till to hrs most important safe battery selfi camera third camera display is amazing amolded screen gives perfect view of everything tough mobile dark blue black colour is unique
14150,4.0,i like the casual look of this top like previous review it doesnt have buttons or zipper so a little difficult to fit into pullover your head
14151,3.0,something wrong with this item on off button not working properly what to do
14152,2.0,heating issue unable to share photos through whatsapp sometime
14153,4.0,phone is good overall but it seems longer screen is and they just increased the length not width actual price is but they are selling on this is not good
14154,4.0,i pretty much liked everything about the laptop except the battery lifeit is compatible to play any game which i throw at it the design is also good well u cant expect good battery life from a gaming pc
14155,4.0,i have been watching this skirt and only scooped it up on sale plus promo it runs small and the size fits like a size would fit lbs and curvy figure flat tummy but have hips and tush the quality is just ok and not worth the full price but on sale it was doable i love aline styles and this skirt is different with the fabric stitching at diagonal pieces it is light weight so i can really see this being worn more in spring and summer and a go to skirt that looks sharp website pho
14156,5.0,after using it around days i got it from amazon in a very gd price rs rs amazon cashback rs normal charging time hours via wa charger after a full charge its work for days and hours after this i charge my oppo f batterry mah times and other mah bluetooth headphone time for rest of the time its on sleep mode build quality and looks is really awesome just star bcz i want some improvement in it my opinion mi has to give a power bank on off option for saving the battery not only mi all power banks companies
14157,3.0,i got this as a gift and one for me the medium fits my mom but i got the large because im and it was large enough but so short waisted i wouldnt recommend it for women over
14158,3.0,i was using mi a before i bought mi a i think this has a lot of issuesfrom couple of days my phone doesnt ring due this im missing a lot of important calls battery life is a major set back for this phone
14159,5.0,good helps in upbringing
14160,4.0,these leggings are very comfortable and cute only reason they are not stars is because the pattern is not quite as vibrant as i was expecting
14161,2.0,there is a problem with the screen in this model not been even two months since bought and the screen stopped working randomly when i went to the samsung store they said that this is the th model that came in with the same problem i advise you to not buy this phone
14162,5.0,i noticed this top as i was going into the fitting room and tried it on on impulse i was pleasantly surprised with the fit and soft quality of the fabric and even more impressed with the price i usually like my tops very fitted and found this one hung loose but not boxy i have been wearing it quite a bit sometimes with a camisole underneath and sometimes not i bought the one with the flowers and it is not seethrough and the light fabric is good for our warm heat i bought my usual s
14163,2.0,very bad device from vivocamera quality is just pathetic
14164,2.0,just piping in here ordered my usual size of small petite the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this but mind the size of the slip in the petites range and also it is aqua
14165,2.0,nice ph but camera quality is very poor battery quality is disgusting please dont buy this phone
14166,4.0,value for money dont go on post where it shown that it constantly ask for update no it doesnt asked for frequent updates
14167,5.0,well i was worried if this samsung product will be the same as the initial days galaxy series phones but no this is totally different the ui one ui is very nice and user friendly though i was a stock android user earlier this seems even better the battery lives upto expectations but drains fast if you have poor cellular signals camera is good at this price range that said you will have all the camera features which the high end phones have overall at this budget this is a wonderful phone i hope of samsung keeps updating the os regularly to keep the phone fresh for quiet a time
14168,4.0,ram is the issue till now other features are good
14169,5.0,the fingerprint reader is tilted due to which its performance has become slow its become irritated when phones doesnt unlock in multiple times i would like to have refundreplacement as per your kindnesshelp me before due date
14170,3.0,the product is really amazing but the piece i got is defected which keeps on hanging within one week of use the phone starts heating while i play any game specifically the finger print sensor and the camera was also not good my brother bought the same phone in first sale and he got a awsome phone but the working and the other things in the phone i have got is defected i think please resolve my problem
14171,2.0,i wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan unfortunately however i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach the chest fit well though it was very low cut but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger the quality seemed okay but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long
14172,4.0,camera quality is good and fingerprint reader also good but my phones has not working left side speaker so i am also very sad
14173,2.0,i wanted to love this top but it looks like an ambitious year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic re hopeful but not good the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on sadly it is going back
14174,1.0,bad producti got this product yesterday and sound quality is very bad of my producti suggest to all of you dont buy this productboat speaker is excellent product
14175,3.0,nice productlate deliverykept me waiting for three days after delivery confirmation
14177,2.0,no one yet come for my tv installation
14178,3.0,this shirt was cute and fit well true to size but i felt for the material it was not worth the the colors offered were a little drab i thought the grey could work for me but it didnt the neck hole looks a little sloppy for a shirt the roll doesnt lay flat all the way around would be better priced in the range
14179,2.0,the model must have this sweater pinned at the back the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything but the fit is at with a long torso and broad shoulders the large was still shlumpy didnt hang right at all bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering my uber fit daughter had the same issue and she usually makes everything that doesnt work for me look amazing returned
14180,4.0,best price i like it
14181,4.0,nice product sound out put is good

14183,2.0,small screenlow battery lifecamera quality is not good even in day time its take bluer pictures video camera is like i am using of nokia another issue which i face that after few minutes of use like checking msglooking photos its heats and its happens after normal use dont know what happened after playing games on iticons on screen are very tiny after changing settingmost irritating its very thin and small to hold
14184,3.0,it is not too bad to purchase i think it needs more updates
14185,3.0,the sound is horrible buttons are so flat hearing echo all the time
14186,4.0,this is such a cute and unique top the fabric is substantial linen but a little rough i went with my regular size but the straps are a little loose i am thinking of having them altered planning on wearing this with a bandeau perfect for summer
14187,3.0,i did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy underlayer i can see it now in the photo but i just thought it wasnt part of the actual vest when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing underlayer was part of the design i dont know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it in my opinion the underlayer takes away from the beautiful vest i guess i could have spent some time and removed it but at that price i just sent it back too bad because the m
14188,5.0,such a beautiful top i understand why other reviews suggested wearing it out personal i love pretty sleepwear so i will be wearing this and matching shorts to bed i ordered a small in both and they seem to run true to size i am lbs and my regular size is small or a size i love the embroidery and the pink
14189,4.0,i just received this and had ordered it in my normal size small and it is way too big sadly xs is sold out so i will just have to return mine the style is like a swing coat and zips up the front the material is thinner but nice and can be worn over sweaters or bulkier items the color is more beige in real life
14190,4.0,the laptop build quality is good but frst b turned on plug it to the charger cuz the battery dry keyboard quality sucks then display is not at all bad
14191,5.0,i love this jacket im tall lbs waist and a d i normally go for an medium and i bought a medium i love it slightly cropped barely snug fit but i can still snap it closed totally warm enough for california fallwinter i like that the sleeves dont have sherpa in them make it easier to layer i bought the silver corduroy and its less white than the photos but it still fits the bill perfectly love that its machine washable too it also has pockets
14192,4.0,the camera quality is too good i like it
14193,4.0,i am writing this review after using it for a year sound quality is amazing but battery life is poor after months of its use it stopped charging and we had to go for a replacement to all going for kolkata service centre their service is pathetic
14194,2.0,i have been reading the reviews of people regularly but still iam wondering bcoz y people r giving or star rating to this product entairly opposite of what they shown in configuration about camera of this mobile it camera looks like primium quality vga mobilesand performance is also not that much what they expected as shown in configuration i dont suggest this to any one iam in one of top users who buy this in first onehour of launching the mobile in amazon
14195,4.0,thickness is more otherwise its ok
14196,3.0,i ordered a large and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed for me it was not it ran a little small on top buttons bulged at my chest and was hard to put on bottom part fit well although flattened my butt unflatteringly im sure this works for some just wasnt the right fit for me sent it back
14197,1.0,i love this tshirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a t its soft pretty and covers my wide bottom well
14198,4.0,face id camera display is best best performance but price is high
14199,1.0,bought inch full hd last year rd class after sales service old and outdated android version glorified smart tv doesnt support most of the apps like ee hotstar etc will not recommend to buy
14200,5.0,it is really good to use specially camera quality and gamming speed it is very easy to use
14202,5.0,does what its meant to do provides decent value for money and high enough speeds for smartphone usage
14203,3.0,this is a beautiful top however it looks better on the pound model the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body if you are any size beyond a then it just makes you look bigger than you are
14204,1.0,this top doesnt at all fit like it does on the model the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirtlike i typically wear size small or but perhaps an xs mightve fit or looked better sadly i must return this shirt
14205,5.0,i loved this dress immediately it is soft to the touch and super comfortable i will be wearing this so much this summer the arms are true to size and the body is flowy and roomy but it is still flattering highly recommend
14206,2.0,received defective piece times i think we should reconsider buying costly digital products online
14207,1.0,this looked great in the store when i tried the tester it made my hair look shinier but when i bought it and actually tried to use it on a frizzy hair day it did nothing absolutely nothing wasted my money
14208,4.0,havent used long enough for star yet started this about weeks ago i have very thin and fine hair have been noticing a lot of fall out and with my hair i cant afford to lose more first of all this has really given my hair body thats something i really didnt expect ive noticed no more fall out as well cant tell if any new hairs are growing in but not losing any was my main concern for now i only wash my hair x a week and only condition the res of the days i have found in this short time that when its time to rewash my hair it really didnt need it my hair has been super shiny since starting this too love the smell as well ive used nioxin before and its dried out my hair and made it unmanageable im sticking with this for now love it so far
14209,4.0,saw this online and didnt catch my attention but saw it in store and decided to try it on really cute and comfy on the fabric feels so soft it runs very big
14210,3.0,i loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didnt the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly
14211,1.0,cheep product and tcl service so bad
14212,1.0,this is a cute dress but not for me i think it runs very small it is super textured so if you dont want to add bulk aka pounds to your frame this probably isnt for you its too bad its online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first im sure its probably adorable on smaller thinner people unfortunately mine is going back
14213,3.0,i buy it no cost emi from credit card but bank is taking interest for that mobile mobile price is but bank is charging
14214,3.0,take too much time to recharge handy product
14215,2.0,battery not good
14216,3.0,i read the online reviews and thought this dress would be a winner it is tight in the chest i am not busty and i would have exchanged it for a larger size but i just didnt like the style the material is beautiful but between the neutral colors and the style i felt it was too little house on the prairie pretty but not the look i was going for
14217,3.0,i got a defective writing speed sometimes at mbps and some other times mbps
14218,2.0,you will get a headache of u turn up the volume
14219,3.0,i had tried this several years ago when my hair was dry and damaged and did not care for it flash forward to now and i find it in my cabinet and decide to give it another go unfortunately the results were pretty much the same i only put a little on my ends but it didnt really make much of a difference besides making them a bit oily not that thats such a bad thing when it comes to your ends but if its just kind of sitting on your hair and not actually doing anything productive it kind of defeats the purpose so while i cant say that this works for my hair it does make a great divinesmelling moisturizer for dry hands and thats what ive been using it for im glad its not going to waste
14220,2.0,lousy gimmick it needs a better search engine should connect to google for better answers
14221,3.0,this top is adorable in style and fit which is why it breaks my heart that i cant recommend it the embroidery snags so easily when i wore it i ended up with several tears in the threads leaving the pattern a bit of a mess it snagged on my rings my watch and my purse i returned it because of this its really too bad and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn simply because it would last a lot longer
14222,4.0,i wanted so badly to keep this dress the print is beautiful in person and the fabric feels pretty nice for a polyester the waist silhouette is incredibly flatteringthe way the waistline and pleats fall made me a look a lot slimmer itd be a great dress for dancing since it flares wonderfully when you twirl but the puffed sleeves looked a lot more poofy on me than they did on the model and i wound up looking exactly like a picture of my mother from which isnt necessarily a bad t
14223,2.0,the sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on however the material is thin and slightly see through also after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear after the third time i wore it i discovered a large hole in the armpit most likely due to the excessive washing i would not recommend this sweater
14224,4.0,good product its almost like a new family member
14225,3.0,works good but has a tenacy to disconnect from wifi
14226,4.0,osm phone good battary back up also good camara for this price n looking also to good
14227,2.0,worst phone ever u cant play pubg in this phone very well
14228,2.0,it has a good storage capacityit os also easy to installbut as compared to samsung evo plus the data transferring speed in this memory card is very pathetic and it is not worthy for this money
14229,3.0,these pants are cute they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly since they already run a bit big this is a major negative i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants
14230,1.0,i bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size beware i have a d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the s it was a thick polyester type material i think this shirt would still work f
14231,1.0,i spoke with your technical person mr raj dated at pm to pm after long call he said amazon filerstk doesnt work with av receiver but my question is why many number of options of all of av receiver on firestik app
14232,4.0,overall a very good phone for this price no complaints so far

14234,4.0,using this phone for about months and the biggest problem is with the camera as there was a blue dost over every photo of sun or the any source of light which give a very disappointing felling while using such an expensive phone
14235,2.0,ive been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews i decided to get the dress the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it however i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm which make it impossible for me to raise my arms i ordered size petite xxs

14245,5.0,verry good
14246,4.0,this is a timeless top i loved the overall look of the top and after eyeing it for several days decided to purchase it warning the shoulder area is cut small due to the fabric at the top i am usually a size because of ddd chest but i bumped up to a and it was perfect

14256,1.0,my amazon echo has completely died after less than one year of light use and will no longer even power on i repeat it will not even turn on buyer beware furthermore i called amazon customer service and they offered to give a discount on a replacement rather than giving us a replacement as technically it should be under warranty we have been amazon prime customers for many years and spent tens of thousands of dollars on amazoncom we will strongly consider where we will be shopping online moving forward and do not recommend you purchase an echo you too will be disappointed shame on you amazon shame on youwhat the heck every happened to the great customer service i have prided amazon about for so many years times are changing at amazon
14257,5.0,i bought this in the pattern in a size medium i am a size around the hipsbutt the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didnt outline every curve of my butt the material is very soft and comfortable but it didnt feel thin or cheap or seethrough it has a nice weight to it i am tall almost and it fit me just as it appears in the picture
14258,3.0,this top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly its going back

14267,2.0,really disappointed with the phone after using it for last days please find below issues in the phone vibration of notifications i use apps like twitter fb as any general user and to be updated i receive notifications the most disgusting thing in the phone is it keeps vibrating for each notification for each tweet by twitter any kind of notification the phone vibrates it is so much disturbing that there is no option to disable it i have talked to customer care visited forums but this is phones default feature rather i will call it as defect feature it is so much distressing to keep phone on table or something it continues vibration unless the only option is to switch off the phone or disable the mobile data so that there is no notification havent even expected from samsung that this basic feature or i should say common sense to keep this option to disable it with user is missing in the phone mobilewifi internet access to specific app now i keep internet access off to specific apps like netflix youtube etc for kids or personal use but there is no option to disable internet access to specific app i have tried using this feature by opting disable background access but this does not serve the purpose app still gets data and gets updated and it can be used please provide option to the user to restrict data for specific app as a new samsung user please consider and implement this as feedback in your marketing and product development team better to focus more on simplicity of using the phone rather than spending on lot of advertisement phone lacks very basic features of disabling vibrations and restricting data these features are most common and available in every phone
14268,2.0,i dont normally write reviews but i purchased this dress in white in different sizes and each dress had the same flaw the hems were very uneven on all three this dress was poorly sewn its a shame because it looked awesome online i was very disappointed

14272,2.0,bad experience fornt can doesnt work and hanged after sec colour are blushing while hanging already raised complaint for replacement
14273,2.0,i loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on in the dressing room area we were all laughing because i tried on a small when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldnt raise my arms the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you werent wearing a dress at all but a shirt too bad poor design for sure and such a shame when th
14274,5.0,i was nervous to order the pants because i didnt think they looked great on the model in the picture they are by far my new favorite pants the fabric is so soft and stretchy yet hugs my curves doesnt stretch out during the day i was expecting the fabric to be thick or stiff but it is very lightweight yet professional for work the cut is perfecti wanted black culottes but im only so a lot of them overwhelm me these are fitted at the top and gradually looser through the thighs a
14275,5.0,super mobile
14276,3.0,i was so in love with these when i saw them online they arrived today and while the fit was great i was disappointed the colors are definitely more drab in person than whats pictured in the photo the material is very thick its soft and theyd be warm in cold weather im sure i liked them but they were underwhelming if they were less expensive i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and theyd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work but sadly back they go
14277,3.0,the phone is nice in the things it claims to be nice in like the camera is very good takes amazing pictures in day as well as low lighting situations the speakers are the best ive heard on a smartphone i had the htc m and these are better than those speakers it has a beautiful screen its small n light weight but this version of iphone has the most bugs ever i think its wifi drops signal every few minutes it just wont recognise your network itll show your network in other networks but wont connect to it now the primary reason why we buy phones these days smartphones not just any phones is for internet n connection if one cant do that than whats the point of spending so much even mobile signal drops randomly it does lag in some animations and some apps are not properly optimised so it lags in those apps the thing now is i asked amazon for a replacement for this piece since it had several connections issues but amazon now wants a receipt from apple a job sheet to replace the phone i have to travel so far to an apple store now to get this thing done not like the amazon i knew before also the delivery by amazon was so slow it took almost a week after the product was dispatched to reach me all i would say is the phone is nice but when you look at it its not worth the k after hdfc cash back also forget k it loooks and performs average no longer can we say its apple it just works there are no problems in apple in whatever limited freedom we get to customise it its just like android now same problems n i think even more than android when am paying so much for it
14278,4.0,i gave only stars because i really wish the fabric was not so sheer unless you are very unmodest you will need to wear a slip i am feet and it hits just above my ankle slits on side and front i know it is supposed to be use as a beach coverupbut forgot that this is way too pretty not to wear out at nightwith a slip i am not a fan of the tie waist so i at wear a belt to cover it overall i recommend enjoy
14279,1.0,volume of the phone not control problematic device no one can resolve my query
14280,2.0,this dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed however the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering
14281,2.0,months after using it front camera awsm the back camera is going to disappoint i do not know further may be fixed by software update

14289,4.0,in the midst of the endofwinter doldrums i tried this cute top on springy powdery happy the lace is soft not too stiff or scratchy and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer because the cami is a separate piece i also envision wearing this as a top over a slipdress with some retro mary janes the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter too yay

14298,4.0,such a cool piece of tech at this price so easy to setup and use in day to day usage sound quality is also good for such a small device overall a good experience using the echo dot
14299,4.0,i saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprisedyes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best i have narrow hips and shoulders but a dd bust so fit is not always easy because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this you may find as i did that it works dressed up or down if i had bought a regular size and were lots younger it could have worked for a dress with tigh
14300,2.0,overall a very good phone my rating is low because the screen cracked with just one fall phone fell down from my pant pocket when i sat on a chair i expected it to b tougher screen replacement is more expensive than the resale value of the phone now

14311,3.0,there are noice of door if little push the door its silent
14312,5.0,after reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman my regular size small was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me this top definitely has no problem staying off the shoulder since i have broad shoulders it doesnt completely come off me loving the bohochic vibe of this

14318,5.0,absolutely satisfied with my kevin tv
14319,2.0,used few days and found that sometimes device is disconnecting very frequently or every minute range is another issue cant cross another wall sound quality is not up to mark due to bass i think
14320,2.0,i was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck that being said i was so disappointed in the fit i ordered a size and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides made no sense hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit order up for length down for arm length
14321,2.0,the product comes with year warranty but it stopped working within year of purchase and do mention how to claim the warranty
14322,4.0,i have given one star less as beoz amazon prime cant be loaded

14324,3.0,i bought this tank for work but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo i usually wear a xxs or xs i am lbs and i got the xs thinking it will be loose which i wanted the arm holes were down to my waist and it was also unusually wide the quality of the fabric is nice though not to heavy and not too thin
14325,1.0,unfortunately is a damaged one
14326,2.0,either sacrifice to use the features of iphone or carry iphone charger power banks for me its like charging more than times a days with a moderate usage so keeping my old android phone as secondary phone
14327,5.0,value for money completely
14328,2.0,i bought this outfit online on sale so i only paid but i think if i saw it in person first i probably wouldnt have purchased it while the design is cute the fabric is beyond cheap its not just polyester its like a plastic polyester i think if you dress it up with high heels necklace armful of bangles you can probably distract from the fabric lb purchased xs and its a little big still
14329,3.0,this skirt was cute on but not particularly flattering i thought the denim was a little too stiff typically alines are flattering on my figure but this was a miss
14330,2.0,what is the main purpose of the phone to make and receive calls right this phone has a defective microphone so call quality is damn poor you have to speak very close to the microphone for the other person to hear you all other feature works quite well as for photos even poco f takes better pictures applez just a brand as was nokia and blackberry once

14336,4.0,i sized down from my typical size small beautiful detail on the back slightly sheer in front but dark bra or cami fixes that shorter in front than back but not too short goes with jeans and pants plus a shorter cardigan or denim jacket would look great
14337,1.0,selfie camera is too worst and the images coming very worst than mp phone like some polythene coverflour applied to the skin it is coming especially in light worst images that i have ever seen i am not suggesting this phone may be at this price they have compromised lot of things even though it is branded phone
14338,4.0,other than small glitches with wifi and learning the apps the dot has worked quite well
14339,3.0,the card does all it promises to do but i have a gripe the nailridge near the outer end of the card is not defined enough which makes it rather difficult to extract the card from a reader or adapterthis is the first microsd card i have that has had this problem

14348,3.0,i got this dress in the mail and while i loved the concept of it it really is too boxy the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist it is more so for show it is fully lined which was interesting and to me made the dress seem boxier the quality is good but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot but it would have still been a shapeless dress just bigger it does fit true to size

14372,3.0,i am a huge fan of pilcro pants and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants the idea is great leather in the front fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look however i couldnt get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around cant bend the leg all the way weird creasing and bunching behind the knee the fit was perfect everywhere else sadly these had to go back
14374,3.0,i do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute but wasnt sure about the fabric hte coloring is fun too i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding
14375,4.0,best price
14376,4.0,very happy with the fit of this sweater which is flattering and unique the ruffle elevates the piece very soft and a good length for me i got a medium in both the sleeves and the body the hole at the neck gaps a little which may bug me as time goes on but otherwise i am so pleased with this sweater that i am willing to put up with it i ordered this in the red which is more of an orangey red which does not suit my skin tone i will exchange for the bluegray version
14377,5.0,all specs and quality of mobile is good as expected no any cons as any youtuber like camera qualityheating gamingnetworkgood sharpness in selfie not very good that does not matter because the dynamic rangeexposures and colours of picture quality is awesomegm sensor is better than gm as gm is used in galaxya and gm sensor is used in redmi note samsung want to increase his online market share so he gives his best that he can give
14378,5.0,i absolutely love this shampoo i saw that there were a lot of negative reviews claiming that it dried out peoples hair so i was hesitant about buying it but im glad i did because it works great for me this shampoo in combination with the macadamia conditioner has made my thick frizzy wavy hair soft and manageable i guess it all depends on hair type so if your hair type is like mine i think youll like it

14383,5.0,amazing bookif you need o learn about financesu must read it for sure
14384,4.0,this dress is so lovely in person with more muted colors than pictured which will transition nicely into fall the overall cut of the dress is really flattering especially for hourglass pear figures sadly i had to return the dress because the arms were insanely small i after putting the dress on i was worried i wouldnt be able to actually get it off if you have teeny tiny armsyoull probably be okay with your regular size if you have any kind of muscle or squish size up
14385,2.0,i can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake
14386,5.0,i have a couple of these and have had no problems with them at all they seem to be fast and supply the full advertised memory capacity
14387,5.0,little bit of higher price
14388,4.0,being six feet tall im always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women and im glad i did on this one with the off the shoulder look you can sometimes gain extra length and its true in this case i stayed tts because of length issues and while it is billowy its not horribly so i would think however if youre between sizes or not worried about height id go with the smaller option adorable comfy casual while being dressy enough for a night out

14393,1.0,dont even think of buying it its not even been a month and it has stopped working worst speakers i have ever bought n now i cannot return it too
14394,2.0,after reading every review i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress wrong i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage the top is very exposing of the bust and im small busted i cant stand wearing camis so there no way id be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large for reference im a straight build lbs and wear a pluses on this dress are i loved the green color and length of sk

14407,5.0,iphone is iphone have used android before but like over all look and feel of ios is way better
14408,2.0,i am usually a size o and ordered and xs due to the band in the center not much give it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part that being said the cup design is a hot mess i am a bc cup size and the top on this could not handle it i felt fully exposed i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small i still felt to exposed they are
14409,1.0,very poor service stopped working within a month of purchase
14410,2.0,wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy does not give any shape to the body do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest
14411,3.0,this is definitely a personal preference review i loved this dress when i tried it on its really beautiful however there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me i know its the style and i have similar style dresses but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me
14412,5.0,gave five stars after the miracle seen in prices just month back it was around rs and now rs i was thinking of buying this phone but cant now just wanted to know why have you increased the rate is it due to gst cant be the reason or doing it for coming sales so you will again lower its price i have seen most of apple products have increased their prices
14413,4.0,phone has good look but only point lacking is its audio system
14414,1.0,in one month one side speaker stop working seriously i dont know now where to go if you are spending this amount and what you get behalf of this really unacceptable too bad at least amazon should need to take action against dealer

14417,1.0,spent five minutes asking her to find rollier hardware store hrs no dice said ok google and had the results in seconds this is typical for my time w alexa thus far day spent a few min calling alexa asking her to set a reminder for am no walked over picked up my ph asked google assistant to set a reminder for am it did but then alexa finally wakes up and sets a reminder for am day asked alexa to google something she said shes not sure she cant use google only bing apparently bing sucks because she can never find anything on bing srsly just use google assistant its free and you dont have to subscribe to all these additional srv to use it
14418,4.0,ever just stood there and a girl comes running in your direction with towel dried hair right when she passes her shampoo smells amazing right well with this shampoo youll get that result every time it smells like vanilla cupcakes i love it its pricey for just shampoo alone but its worth it if you scrub really well your hair will be perfumed for the next two days if you let the conditioner set in for about minutes itll give you a more lasting result the smell is the strongest when you let it air dry its perfect if youre going out later that night youll still smell fresh
14419,1.0,this sweater is a lovely color and very soft however the sweater sheds terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance its also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through
14420,5.0,superb mobile awesome
14421,1.0,the phone was defective
14422,1.0,one practically useless laptop thats good for literally nothing will freeze with just tabs in chrome loading low graphic trading charts not good for even using as a word processor word documents will cause it to continuously freeze losing so much time everyday because of this made a mistake because i was on a budget even if you dont have money and buy this as a budget laptop please save and buy a better configuration or pay more and use emi for payback
14423,2.0,i didnt think top was very flattering and while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottomjust looks missewn instead of purposeful sadly this one is going back to the store
14424,3.0,i ordered the stress in an xl i usually wear a size in most retailer clothes the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small also i felt that i was choking it is better suited for thin women

14431,1.0,i love anything orange when i saw this coat online i ordered it as i loved all the features the features of the coat are fun however the coat came all bunched up in the package i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away i tried the coat on the buckles were poorly made i ended up returning this jacket
14432,3.0,this device is good but not that good i am mentioning some of the drawbacks of buying this phone fingerprint and face unlock is not that quick it takes some time for face unlocking back cam is fine but front cam is too poor in low light and back cam is not having night mode as well gaming performance of this phone is very poor even at low settings some of these games like pubg shows lag
14433,2.0,i ordered this dress online the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small particularly in the waist i normally wear a or but i ordered the it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a c i liked the look but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric additionally the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out i returned it immediately

14435,5.0,great book
14436,5.0,perfect cozy sweater nice details exactly what i wanted to upgrade from sweatshirts
14437,1.0,i wanted to love this couldnt wait for it to arrive unfortunately it doesnt look anything like the picture i usually wear a ml in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way and it is extremely shimmery i love velvet but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top sadly it is going back
14438,2.0,the smart remote specified in the manual is missing so many of d smart functions can not b performed

14443,3.0,this item states you should wash in cold water and tumble dry low heat it shrunk after first wash in cold water and i didnt even use the dryer do not wash real bummer
14444,2.0,i bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints however they are too sheer i dont want to wear a tank top but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer i can also see the fabric tearing easily it is too delicate i sent both colors back what a waste because the prints and colors are good these tops are also not for busty ladies i have a big bust and the top part didnt cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st
14445,3.0,the minute i put this on i knew it was wrong firstly the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie secondly as i stood looking in the mirror the dress simply read nightgown it was frumpy and too long on me so back it went

14447,1.0,installation is very late and return window will close on same installation day
14448,2.0,i was so excited to get this dress and it was such a disappointment it looks so cute on the model but it was very different when i got it the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be and the pattern just looked a bit strangeit stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral the dress fit really awkwardly on the top the straps were way too long and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on i normally wear a p and i ordered down to a p the waist
14449,2.0,like other reviewers have said this item runs extremely long and large i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so widemuch wider than any standard wide leg pant ive owned sadly had to return
14450,2.0,ms has worst picture quality and a lag in other app operations not a worthy phone which tells the camera is mp pixels when u expand little u will feel like its mp old phone pics in homelight and evening night photos r even worse spoke to amazon customer care for hr and they even dont want to give me a higher value other company phone in return of this bad phone which will be beneficial for amazon all the best for people who buy mp phones thinking that they will get crisp n better pixel photos no u will be dissatisfied after current service from amazon will shift to flipcart even though i am a prime member anyway mistakes happen so next time anyone buys a phone it will only be replaced with same phone if its physical damaged and for other issues with phone u have to go to service centre learnings for me samsung photo quality is seen by clicking photos and seeing the quality not by asking blancco to do auto test and say its passed if camera clicks the photo laughable grow up
14451,1.0,i ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look but returned them because they fit weird too tight around the too high waistline and normally i like a high waistline fit ran small and the overall quality of the fabric wasnt as nice as i was hoping for pretty disappointed
14452,2.0,very bad battery backup i have never seen before wrost battery backup
14453,2.0,good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings its hard to see where i would wear them sorry but they have to go back
14454,2.0,i loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available unfortunately i was disappointed on arrival besides being more muted colorwise the sizing is way off i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me on the model it looks like it skims the body when in reality it falls like a tent i tried tucking it into a skirt but there was just too much fabric though the neck worked for me i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow also it
14455,4.0,overall the phone is a big yess in this price range design is pretty neat and usable camera is workable batterh life is humongous but has made the phone heavy the screen quality is okay as compared to other phones should have ips lcd if not amoled but tft is a big no still produces great colours with a little blue or the cold tint great phone for handy and usefulness
14456,1.0,i got the defective product the side buttons was not working properly now its screen flashes continuesly its not working i think vendor has given me the defective peace and even mi help center does not providing service by saying you have opened the smartphone outside service center i suggest do not purchase mi product specially in sals they provide defective product totally waste of money looking some help from amazon service center if someone is facing same please raise your feedback

14462,3.0,first of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways if you wear it so its long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa my only big complaint is that ive worn it twice and theres already a large hole in the arm seam poor construction which is disappointing hopefully mine was a oneoff id recommend it but definitely wait for a sale

14464,3.0,i ordered this dress in two sizes pxs and ps they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price also the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the

14487,5.0,the products works great got it on a discount the samsung ui is any day better than miui overall feels premium but the camera can be improved edge detection is an area for improvement clicking photos through the mp cam takes a while to save making continuous clicks a little irritating battery life is certainly the best in the segment amazon delivery was good and prompt
14488,2.0,i tried this dress on in a and a a is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea the fit in the outer layer however as the previous poster mentioned the lining is super tight i couldnt even pull the lining down over my hips the was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining not sure what when wrong here but its a shame because its a really cute dress
14489,5.0,this cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so its a winwin it hangs a little boxy so ill need to figure out how to style it so its more flattering the pockets are a pretty gold color you can see it from the inside and adds a nice touch of color its a keeper
14490,3.0,i love these pants bought them in the mustard color my only complaint is that they are not colorfast i washed them in cold water with other colored items most of which belonged to my husband not good and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants retailer please color test your garments there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age

14494,3.0,i am going to keep this because it has the wired port to connect to external speakers which was my main reason to get the echo dot but from a conversation and intelligence perspective the google home is way better my son has the google home in his room and we have couple of echos the big ones in other rooms and hands down the google home is winning in every conversationengagementqna son is now learning spanish and google home can engage him really well with spanish we are not native spanish speakers so it is great to have google home play that role partly at home

14503,3.0,the feedback is very simple incase you already have a fire tv stick and willing to buy this one which is k please do not buy it the one which you already have is more than sufficient and fulfilling the exact purpose there is absolutely no difference at all in the picture quality or sound or alexa integration etc i am highly disappointed regretting as to why i bought it when i was already using my older fire tv stick happily my moneynhas absolutely gone waste into it its exactly the same
14504,3.0,performance is good camera quality is very poor it says mp but in actual its only mp as after installing camera applications option for maximum picture size is uptomp only

14506,3.0,i agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides but when i lift my arms thats another story i also agree that the material wrinkles easily this is a highmaintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale

14509,1.0,very poor quality
14510,5.0,excellent phone as promised before purchasing the phone my main concerns based on other reviews were the camera and the notch my previous phones were of sony and google so the camera on the oneplus is not upto the mark but that is probably the only downside and one that does not matter a lot to me personally and the notch is a bit annoying i have opted to hide the notch in the settings amazing battery life hours of screen time quick charging gameplay experience is great best speakers on a phone i have experienced sometimes a bit too loud onscreen fingerprint reader is very good but it does struggle when the phone is on a table i have to pickup the phone in my hand to best position my thumb the phone both the rear and the screen is very prone to fingerprint smudges holding my old google nexus in one hand and the oneplus in the other hand i definitely feel the oneplus to be more sticky need to constantly wipe the screen and use a case for the back

14513,1.0,i had recently tried purchasing apple iphone on amazon the product was defective on the top they dont support for replacement or repair rather they ask us to visit istore if we had that much time to purchase a mobile in person n trust on amazon this is how they respond replacement page has technical glitch that it has steps which doesnt go to the rd page to initiate ur replacement r refund customer support is the worst i could expect from amazon in this case

14544,5.0,what a great find this is so easy to dress up or down and a very comfortable fit and fabric the skirt fabric is pretty form fitting so not something i can comfortably wear to work but its a versatile piece otherwise the buttons on the sleeve are a nice touch
14545,1.0,it is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordinglythis does not run smallthis is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with womens apparel sizing i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for mevery small
14546,2.0,as per specs its a good mobilelooks and feels is also very goodbattery is descent though expected more due to samoled display is really goodcamera is averagegood as per budget but it lags some basic featuresphone is slow to respondapp loading time is moresound quality is very badloud speaker is not loudcall quality is worst dont expect to talk in this handset in crowdy area like train buseven normally call volume is so low i have to activate hands free mode waiting for software update to fix the problem probably

14553,1.0,last month creat software problem
14554,4.0,haha the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be dont trust the picture i was misled by the neckline i thought i saw a structured kind of asianinspired mockneckfunnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which with my full bust underneath it refuses to pose as a mockneck for me overall there isnt much structure here at all but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy
14555,1.0,after month display become blank no picture only sound i can understand it can happen but main problem is whenever i tried to rich customer care i never got positive response from them and they took around days to fix small problem first they where not ready to pickup tv
14556,4.0,i read other reviews that there was extra fabric in the stomach area and knew itd be perfect for me to wear to a wedding at weeks pregnant and it was i got tons of compliments it accented my baby bump perfectly fitted but not too tight the pleats at the top create a nice shape for the bump very comfortable for an outdoor wedding my only complaint is that the armholes are rather tight after pregnancy i will try belting the dress
14557,3.0,loved the design and print of this blouse however every time i put it on or took it off i could hear the seams ripping definitely wasnt because it was too small either
14558,3.0,i got this because i saw it thought it would be a great shampoo ive always loved the organix brand a lot of their products are awesome this one though does not do a good job cleaning my hair it leaves residue on my scalp it makes my scalp itch etc it does smell good but it is not that great it might be just that my hair doesnt absorb it that well but its no good to me
14559,3.0,except battery mah rest everything is awesome good phone but if you are too busy guy and dont have time to charge then its not worth it because you have to sometimes charge twice a day
14560,4.0,i was looking for an offtheshoulder top and chose this one it is pretty the bottom of the shirt is fairly billowy so i can only wear with skinny pants takes a little getting use somewhat restricting my arm movement so the shirt pops off my upper arms
14561,5.0,great camera
14562,2.0,i thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top the fabric will most definitely snag as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin not very good quality i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge everywhere but the neck
14563,3.0,love the way this dress looks online sadly it doesnt look great on me im athletic build the small fit perfectly but the extra fabric in the hippocket area just seemed to drag me down i really wished this worked for me but i think youve gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off
14564,5.0,this card has met my requirements i wanted a gb card with an adapter and i wanted the faster card and it is a c it worked out of the box with no problem i bought of them at the same time one for mine and one for my wifes smartphonesamsung galaxy centura i am satisfied with both of them
14565,4.0,battery life not as expected disappointment where i needed a long lasting battery life maybe a problem with my piece camera and display are more than good fingerprint scanner is not so bad afterall onscreen fingerprint optical ones compared to oneplus t of one of my friend performs equally what more to expect buy phones with rear or physical fingerprint scanner if you need a speedy unlock moreover face unlock is pretty good but less secure
14566,3.0,i bought the grey t with the design around the yoke its cute but the fabric is a little on the thin side kind of cheap im glad i didnt pay full price for it runs true to size
14567,4.0,overall good product but this is metz brand by skyworth
14568,5.0,if you have a love for vintage romantic feminine attire this is the dress for you it evokes memory of days gone by it isnt just beautiful the quality is superb make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it

14572,2.0,i bought this on sale at rexall for cdn so its not exactly cheap for a drugstore product however ive been using it for about three weeks now my reaction meh my hair is curly about a bc curl and extremely dryit gets frizzy very easily my main trouble is getting my hair to cooperate with me in the morning i usually either wash or rinse my hair after the gym every morning and then head straight to work so i needed something to help my hair air dry into something other than a lions mane ive integrated this spray into my routine this week i rinse or cowash my hair towel dry and then spray this kukui oil spray into my hair while its damp comb it out with a wide tooth comb and scrunch with tresemm climate control mousse the result i think i might as well not use it i find this product way too quotlightquot for my thick coarse hair if you have dry curly hair like mine youre generally looking for something to give your hair moisture this is not it fine haired girls give it a shot curlies thick or dry haired girls dont waste your money
14573,1.0,not impressed ogx my hair is thick and a little wavy and all i wanted was some texture but this stuff made my hair so greasy the exact opposite of what i was looking for and this is weird but its such a wet product i got little to no texture at all from this stuff where it got to the point where i drenched my precious hair in it and still nothing there goes dollars ill never see again what a waste of money smells good though but that is it upset u ogx
14574,5.0,a very good phone in the budget segmet from samsung nice dew drop design dedicated memory card slot regular software updates good battery life easily last a day with moderate usage no lagging issues camera quality is satisfactory not exceptional but wide wide angle lens is a good addition fingerprint reader also give good response and face unlock is good too
14575,2.0,if you want a mp rear camera phone never ever buy this one not at all good for night photography wide angle camera is so pathetic the extra area in wide view is blured the camera feels like mp battery back and display is greatfront camera is alson good
14576,2.0,i have dry damaged hair i tried this product today and to me the directions told me to spray it on a part and flat iron it i did so and saw steam coming which can only mean more damage the result was fried tangled hair that i cant even put my fingers through one of the main ingredients is alcohol which is bad for the hair i will be returning this product tomorrow ive yet to find a heat protecting spray that didnt suck the life out of my hair and make it feel sticky and strawlike it is difficult to spray on the hair since it seems to saturate a single area it smells nice like coconut i wouldnt recommend
14577,4.0,the hemline on this is somewhat see through and that makes this denim skirt really stylish the waist runs small so i had to return my size for the next size up which was still a bit snug but the skirt is so far beyond the normal hohum denim skirt i just have to keep it at it hits just right slightly above the knee
14578,3.0,its not worth buying in this days battery is too small
14579,2.0,battery is draining very fast even on stand by mode and product is not showing any default ringtone whereas other mi a has a list of default ringtone the product has no gallery or for explorer although other mi a has a file explorer
14580,5.0,i really liked the dress on line but i didnt appreciate how lovely it was until i received it it fit perfectly and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork

14586,5.0,bought this to store music on my phone works flawlessly after three months so far no problemsin my card reader i average megabytes read and write to it
14587,3.0,in the same room i can easily talk on my honor mobile but not on this mobile i guess network catching capacity not good

14589,5.0,keeping battery backup out if the review this is an amazing phone
14590,4.0,few of the remote buttens are not working tried locally in many electronic stores but couldnt get it can i get one
14591,4.0,i recommend this dress for people who do not have my body type the dress is very comfortable and nicely designed my torso is a bit barrel chested with a large bust so the fabric both wrapped and billowed out unattractively causing the waistband to ride up and the skirt to pouf out over my tummy if your body is more like the model this is a flattering dress for reference i am dd and ordered the medium petite perhaps if i bought the nonpetite version or sized down maybe it will
14592,2.0,i love everything by cloth stone so was excited to see that they made a dress hooray i ordered it in the xl which is my usual size in their shirts when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips i am a true size and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move my chest also caused the dreaded button gape it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure so disappointing
14593,2.0,this is not a good choice phone hangs and its is slow not having good performance
14594,1.0,quality for product was not checked product was not worked as per your description return pick up facility was not good i took follow up continue days not satisfied

14597,3.0,i love the look and feel of these shorts typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that theyre practically made of nothing but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric however they run very large being lbs and about i typically buy size or xs but these looked a bit ridiculous on me with how big they are i tried shrinking them in the wash since theyre cotton and that helped some along with getting rid of the creases from shipping
14598,4.0,the mobile is just awesome the display is super when you watch hd videos its just great the user handling is also flexible the performance is good at times i find the camera not up to the mark
14599,2.0,ive never been so excited about a line the coconut milk smells absolutely gorgeous i actually dont like this particular product but i am also using the leave in nourishing milk which i love and i am about to buy the split ends mender pros really nice sweet coconut smell unfortunately it doesnt last which i expected it to cons very thick pastey consistency hard to scoop out of the tub and very hard to distribute through hair doesnt run through smoothly like a regular conditioner and when i wash it off my hair feels coarse and i need to use my normal conditioner to untangle my hair didnt notice a significant difference in my hair i recommend getting the other products in this line though not the shampooconditioner price aud packaging repurchase no
14600,2.0,ordered on th sept and recd on st oct sheer waste of money either they have limited the capacity of mobile by software degradation or they are faking on specifications build extremely extremely poor thick plastic brick in your hand even though my redmi go had plastic body but its fitting was good in this device there is some crackling noise battery dont know why but just hr of youtube resulted in drain didnt expected this from mah battery and super amoled screen camera mp rear camera was not able to produce clear image from a distance of meter pro mode doesnt have control on shutter speed no manual zoom option
14601,4.0,i like this shirt because it can be worn for dressy or casual i like the weight although i wish it was just a tad less seethrough i can get by without wearing a tank under but i usually feel like i have to wear one i like the link i feel like it runs just a little large i love the length of the sleeves and the detailcut of the sleeve i like the colors on the shirt too its a good versatile addition to my wardrobe
14602,2.0,have not had enough time to read up on this item to understand it yet i cannot seem to get music to play

14604,2.0,in a second month this cable stop work phone not charge properly take hr to charge it do not charge properly
14605,3.0,on me this was not good at all couldnt get it off fast enough the thick stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly and im a size also the color is a dark brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive
14606,5.0,great batterycamera and display goes from to in hrs mins with the in the box charger asphalt can be played lag free in high graphics bloatware or unnesessary apps can be stopped from getting installed the ultra wide camera is great and both the rear setup and front camera provide sharp and good quality pictures the phone does not lag at all in handling day to day tasks and can also handle multitasking with ease my review is based on my weeks usage if you want a phone for taking pictureswatching videos and playing nonheavy duty gamesthis phone is for you this combines the specs of xioami and the quality and assurance of samsung

14629,5.0,im in love the cut fit and fabric of this jean have made it my favorite everyday pair theyre mostly rayon followed by equal parts polyester and cotton with a touch of spandex thrown in the right combination for fit softness and durability these hold their shape well so i dont have to wash them every other time i wear them the ankle length hits me at the top of my ankle bone perfect im pounds ordered size
14630,5.0,a very powerful book and a must read for any book enthusiast i became a different person after reading this the quality of the book is good and the print is also fine must buy
14631,5.0,i buy this productits such a nice product in very very low price with better quality

14633,4.0,great only negative is the volume the echo diy does not offer a good volume range
14634,3.0,the dress is too big i got size after checking the measurements chart for reference lb it is too wide not as fitted as in the picture the cut is too deep might work better for a bustier lady but looks pathetic on me the pattern is too bright much brighter that in the picture i got red pattern its not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately its just the colors are much more vibrant in real life the material is heavier than i expected
14635,3.0,this is one of those products that sounds like it is going to be fantastic then falls a little flat i really looked forward to some smoothing benefits from the bkt conditioner but i have gotten much better results from cheaper shampoos the smell is nice and light and the packaging is pretty but the conditioner is painfully average if you are looking for deep nourishing conditioner try aussie or pantene
14636,2.0,very disappointed with the speaker in this device todays technology as it is a more efficient speaker couldshould have been usedin my opinion
14637,1.0,carry case and data cable not in box

14654,4.0,fingerprint thoda slow h lekin overall good phone
14655,3.0,update well i suppose nothing lasts forever after almost a year the card has gone bad i use the card a lot in my smartphone a tmobile samsung galaxy s sght all my photos voice recordings and downloads go on this card and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via usb cable a few days ago a video file i transferred to my computer refused to play correctly no video and the audio was skipping and squealing which i recognize as the sound of a corrupted file i thought maybe the transfer didnt complete tried it again same result i tried to play the file right on the phone and it didnt play on my phone i knew there was a problem i tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there still no luck then i deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone not the sd card eureka it played perfectlyi formatted the sdxc card twice once from the phone and once through windows and tried the same test downloaded video file to the card then to the phone same result both times it wouldnt play on the sd card but it did on the phone all videos used to play perfectly on the sd card finally i swapped out the card for my older sandisk ultra gb micro sdxc card like magic it worked perfectly no matter what i played on it so yeah the gb card is dead i should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days agothankfully sandisk ultra products like this carry an incredible lifetime warranty or years for regions that dont recognize lifetime their extreme line of cards raise that to years ive contacted their support for an rma so ill update this review as events unfold if they replace it quickly ill bump this back up to starsoriginal reviewim using a samsung galaxy s smartphone sandisk ultra micro sd cards have never failed me and this ones no exception i used to have a gb card theyre fast and reliable and never corrupt data which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like pny those fail quite often i cant wait to get the new gb model

14660,4.0,well it depends on what you need it for for tracking steps through out the day it does a good job tracking steps but its useless if you dont put efforts to increase your steps based on the information for tracking distance while running if this is your only use you have many apps to do this job for heart rate tracking for a normal person this is unnecessary data again as far as i know for getting notifications from phone well im not using this as you have turn on your bluetooth in phone and this reduces battery life of phone and also phone is almost always in my hands sleep tracking im not sure how accurate this is anyway im not using this too as its a little uncomfortable to wear it while sleeping as i keep my hands under head while sleeping also again if you dont put efforts to improve based on the information its no use again i think i have covered major features now coming to performance battery life is good without continous heart rate tracking and without connecting to mobile for notifications it lasted for month in single full charge display is ok ok little difficult to ch eck time in sunlight one shortcoming is both my bands dont turn on sometimes when i raise my wrist to check time looks good and durable i feel i dont need it though
14661,2.0,i ordered this top because it was percent cotton and a cute design when it arrived i thought it was a cute different top uniquely designed when i tried it on it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice unfortunately it did not work for me i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect

14760,2.0,hi i am writing this review after using it for a month for doing development on visual studio the laptop performance is pathetic i decided to do a ram upgrade i thought while buying looking at amazons product specs pls see the picture which said there are two ram slots and hence i can do an upgrade to gb but when i spoke to hp technical support they were not sure they asked me to check if it has two ram slots the gadgets now page states that it has only one ram slot please see the picture so buyers pls check with amazon or hp before buying i will come to know the status after i take it to hps authorised service agent updates on th sep hi i would like to update for the benefit of those who had read my earlier review i managed to speak to hp and got a confirmation that the laptop does have two ram slots i have bought an additional gb ram card and have installed the same on this laptop and the laptop is working fine so now i have two ram slots one with a gb ram card and another with gb ram card the laptop shows gb ram and i am seeing a marked improvement in performance

14762,5.0,the product is great value for money love the features its picture and sound quality are awesome
14763,2.0,beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am same with the arms if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams im and a classic size and this

14781,4.0,this sweater is pretty fits tts feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed i particularly like the buttons on the side you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures i think this shade of gray is also appealing to me as its not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think
14782,1.0,im so disappointed this dress didnt work out i ordered the size medium post baby im a solid dress size or depending on the designer the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up also the length was super long description says which would be mid thigh for me but this thing hit me mid knee also like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress but the shoulders def
14783,2.0,i ordered a small which is my usual retailer size but this was like a tent on me its fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasnt what i was looking for also it is very long a very weird amount of long also there is only eyelet on the front the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing

14785,5.0,nice phone every thing as expected
14786,2.0,it sounds low

14788,5.0,this is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website the style is very flattering fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare i am pounds dd and i bought a size and it fit great the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress this one is a keeper

14800,3.0,initially i was happy to get such a good hardware this price but as soon as i inserted sim problem initiates very poor network reception however at the same time other mobiles with same network showed percent better reception and amazon is refusing to consider this issue as far as display is concerned it is one of the best display available in the market rear camera is superb but a bit disappointment is selfie camera battery life is good overall if you can afford to compromise with network or in your area if network problem is not there then you can go for this mobile worth at this price
14801,1.0,poor tray quality
14802,2.0,i am typically a small in dresses but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down it had no shape but hung like a paper sack the armholes fit perfectly though if i had sized down they may have been too tight i am lb i will return too bad because it is a pretty dress

14810,5.0,this is great it gives me a lot of extra storage space for my phone it just worked out of the box perfect
14811,2.0,after trying several sizes including petite and regular i am sad to return this dress the regular sizes were too long on me i am and although the petite fit me just a little short the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldnt get the fit usually i have great luck with cloth stone
14812,3.0,heating problems
14813,3.0,true to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso very unflattering cut
14814,1.0,i get randomly error messages with my nokia disk error and the card stops working its so so sad i bought a cheap gb micro sd class that works better than this
14815,1.0,luckily i bought this on sale i now see the instructions online say to hand wash but i bought mine in the store the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size
14816,3.0,this was going to be my go to top i loved the look of the billowy shirt especially in light blue when it arrived i knew it wouldnt work for my body im athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup i tried it on anyway i really wish it fit it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight its just the cut of the shirt this top is best for someone that isnt busty and has slender upper arms
14817,1.0,waste of money power supply dead after days
14818,3.0,the some what greyis not that impressive as expectedand also the features are not that great to boast about
14819,3.0,this top is beautiful in the model shot but average in person it ran really small i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium it barely fit over my chest and was pretty short i am also the material is very thin not so much that you can see your undergarment but if you get cold everyone will know it also for the price i expected a sturdier fabric i would recommend holding out for sale if you are interested in this top
14820,2.0,device is getting heated
14821,2.0,sent product back product did not clearly specify
14822,1.0,the list is endless how terrible this product is i love the smell and i dont mind the consistency if the product actually worked i figured since i have naturally dry and damaged curly hair this was the reasoning for why the product was not moisturizing enoughbut seeing other reviews this product is terrible for even oily straight hair the shampoo seems to give all hair types very coarse brittle hair extremely disappointed will never repurchase i was hoping for a moisturizing siliconesulfate free shampoo that smelled good after washbut i will have to go back to my original shampoo i would say this would be better for oilyprone hair but even then most people would have the same results
14823,2.0,hard to review this as the card arrived doa couldnt write to it at all and it wouldnt format i returned it and amazon was great about the credit ive owned several sandisk memory cards and they have all performed well and i was a little surprised that this one failed out of the box id read a good review of the samsung gb micro card and i bought that instead very pleased with it
14824,3.0,book is really awesome but tough language to understand need dictionary
14825,4.0,found all things pretty good and working pretty well
14826,5.0,got it for kgreat buildgud display and decent processor for light gamingit doesnt come with a bagthat the only downsidefor kit a great buy for me
14827,3.0,i really really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it however it bunched like crazy in the back i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home but with the cost of the dress i cant justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed sigh so close
14828,1.0,headset is not working properly please exchange itrespond on this review
14829,3.0,the details on this dress were pretty but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that but not great on an hourglasspear shaped figure fits tts
14830,1.0,want to return but u are not accepting it bad experiance on amazon really paying a huge amount and giving bad quality products
14831,2.0,i built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers moss copper and burgundy they are soft wellfitting pretty linings and very satisfactory this new version is stiff material and illfitting not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better but it is too full across the front with the stiff materials this is a bad fit disappointing and going back
14832,4.0,here are some of the following things that you must know before buying the product display the display is fabulous other phones are also providing super amoled but this phone gives extra brightness too making it eye catching use tempered guard and back cover coz the amoled displays are delicate camera you are just listening about its not mp its just on the papers its not just like that see it gives little blurry and grainy image when shot in artificial lighting like in home but when you shot in natural lighting it just gives amazing picks with the great dynamic range same with the front camera but it gives little soft and less details when you zoom x i think this problem can be solved by upcoming software updates battery i if you are a gamer then hours of battery backup ii if you are a normal user then days of battery backup performance amazing performance by samsung if you are thinking that samsung is a hanger company then you are wrong current samsung mid range phones doesnt hang and it gives a much better user experience than other phones app just opens in seconds in general if you are a gamer and want to enjoy heavy games like pubg you have to face some heating issues and minor lags within to minutes looks doesnt matter when applying back cover rest is upto you overall build quality is good if you are not a heavy gamer i will strongly recommend ms it will not disappoint you
14833,5.0,great quality flattering cut could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps

14835,2.0,disappointed bought this for my sister and afyer months of usage the phone sits with me she was done with it it seems camera is the biggest downside major updates and now the clarity is tottally gone not to mention thr battery drains like anything and worst thing is that while chargin it heats up lile a fry pan network issue is the next thing network connectivity drops frequently and tested using another phone with same carrier and the other phone had no issues samsung galaxy note totally dissappointed by the buy delivery speed product performance
14836,4.0,the phone is nice and works efficiently touch is fluid as i have been an android user since long so i really find it good it is handy and looks classy and elegant camera is good i have been using this phone since months and it never got stuck or hanged
14837,3.0,this top is much stiffer more babydoll and boxier than pictured lining is stiff too and colors more muddy than shown i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me i have broadish shoulders and a chest i thought it would be a fun drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately its going back

14842,3.0,these jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models but these were very long i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans but these did not fit the same as their other styles they are good quality and would probably f

14852,3.0,this dress is very cute i loved it the quality is excellent however the fit is off im lbs c this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered it was tight around the waist this caused creasing and buldging in the back the color is much more vibrant in person i would have kept it if it fit properly
14853,2.0,so far so good it does what its supposed to do doesnt seem any faster or slower than any other micro sd card i had bought a cheap imitation on ebay and regretted it as it crashed it really doesnt pay to be cheap with memory its all about the reliability which you get with this product update big problem with this sd card if you are a windows phone user does not properly record hd video video recording to sd card is consistently choppy pop in another sd card records fine record to my phone records fine ive tried formatting it every which way and it isnt working well go with another brand windows phone users

14864,2.0,im returning this jacket i tried it on after it was delivered and was happy with the weight cut and color although its more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture however the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt it will last very long i actually cant get the zipper to zip at all its very rough and lightweight and im afraid if i keep trying to force it ill just end up breaking it sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality thi
14865,2.0,disappointed does not have amazon prime app does not have any good browser there are some apps available out of the box which are not even worth boot time is slow wifi connectivity is main issue even when wifi is on it does not detect internet need to reboot few times to make it work this is real pain could have more better ux have to fiddle with remote for few basic things but thats ok more you use u will get use to tech support is just ok responsive but not solver what i liked picture quality body is robust not feeble installation guy came fast two remote though not very use full as compared with samsung and sony price is affordable i can live with prons and cons except wifi issue which is most painful
14866,4.0,display quality is very good and camera also very decent but the fingerprint sensor is not working properly attempts to times in a once even then its cant recognize i hope in the next it will be improve well

14870,2.0,when i wore this the two times i did i got a ton of compliments it runs small and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning after the second wear the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable i have to return it and am so disappointed sadly i would not recommend buying it for that reason
14871,1.0,i am frustrated from this mi tv i bought this product just month before now mi tv is not working i have registered my compliant however i did not get response so far from mi side that is a terrible experience which i felt so friends think before buy this cheap and low quality mi tv otherwise you will cry after buy this product
14872,3.0,i totally agree with the first review i thought this was soooo cute on the model but its loose fitting and has no shape to it
14873,1.0,horrible fit i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress
14874,5.0,i love this product i have extremely long hair and only have haircuts per year it is a miracle for my ends my hair is prone to tangling because it is so long and this helps with that and makes my hair super soft it also smells lovely important tip do not use this products at the roots because it will probably make hair greasy up there only use at least inches away from the roots on the rest of hair i will probably be using this product for forever
14875,1.0,mobile note proper work mobile directly switch of
14876,2.0,update wth why would they reformulate with nonnatural ingredients inc dimethicone cost perhaps or maybe complaints from people saying they couldnt get a lather it was drying etc just repurchased then noticed the ingredients list has changed i loved using this shampoo in my rotation but my love affair only lasted one bottle oh well im returning it to boots as their website shows the old ingredients list and i obv wont repurchase unless i can find some old bottles on ebay now i understand some of the negative reviews original review considering argan oil is fairly high up on the ingredients list as well as other natural oils this is a reasonablypriced shampoo im stunned at the negative reviews on this shampoo as ive had such a positive experience with it so far but i wonder if theyre mostly from people whose hair is very dry already as more natural shampoos wont usually do your hair any favours when it comes to moisture even though this one is supposed to give you moisture it probably wouldnt give enough for those hair types anyhow despite being a regular oiler mostly for hair growth recently ive been finding i need a slightly more moisturising shampoo than im used to in order to avoid tangles as i grow my hair longer nothing too conditioning just a naturalish shampoo that wont leave my hair squeaky clean just clean i have coloured fine bra strap length hair with a slight wave and i normally do well with mild natural shampoos i dont want sls or anything else colourstripping or dimethicone it contains dimethicone copolyol a watersoluble siliconederivative and i dont mind a slight lack of lather which you expect when you leave out sls its early days but this seems to fit the bill i dont use the matching conditioner as im happy with my current ones im not sure id want to use this one every time i wash as i think i would soon get buildup at my oily roots but as it doesnt make my fine hair a stringy mess or overload it im pleased btw the texture really reminds me of faith in nature jojoba shampoo for dry hair i gave up on that really quickly about a year ago as i dont think i understood you have to emulsify it with water in your hand to get a lather before working it into your hair i might give it another try if i cant find the old formula for this shampoo
14877,3.0,this runs very small and has a beautiful design but it feels very cheap material feels like thinnest possible tshirt material out there surprised with retailer on this one back home to retailer it goes
14878,3.0,every thing is perfect in this tv but still i have rated this tv as star just because it doesnt supports netflix and amazon prime i have tried calling mi customer care twice but both times they have said it may be available in there next update
14879,3.0,this dress is gorgeous but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only i wish it worked the fabric and pattern are beautiful sad to send it back
14880,3.0,i was excited to add an echo dot to my house i am a happy owner of the original size echo and planned to add this to a group now that this feature is allowed linking to my current echo was no issue even able to sync it easily with a bluetooth speaker however i found the microphone sensitivity to be much weaker than my other echo the dot still functions fine after it hears me but i need to get very close or shout to get it to wake and respond thats a little disappointing as i hoped to get a set and fill my house with universal sound but will need to wait to make sure im not frustrated with its responsiveness
14881,2.0,im so surprised by the high rating the smell is unbearable and overpowering i can put up with greasy serums if using a little bit will really help my hair be smoothershinier this serum does not deliver anything but smelly greasiness the garnier fructis sleek and shine moroccan sleek oil treatment is hg for me i also like the chi and gvp paul mitchell serum
14882,5.0,excellent phone very good sound and picture quality and internet also very fast
14883,5.0,love this turtleneck its perfect for fall and to layer im usually an xs in things from retailer and this is no different i definitely recommend

14888,3.0,i want to say i love the organix brand their products are sulfate free paraben free cruelty free they dont test on animals and their packaging is made out of recycled plastic with that being said i hate giving this a bad review but i am only talking about my personal experience i have tried the organix brazilain keratin line then this lineit worked for a few months then it made my hair dry and lifeless i switched to the organix coconut milk line and i love it i think organix has so many kinds of shampoos that there is something for everyone i will like to try the other ones but i honestly love the coconut milk one the best you may have a different reaction with the argan oil shampoo and that is fine im just stating my experience

14894,4.0,batter life is good comparatively with other iphones
14895,4.0,i would not wear this to bed its almost too pretty ive been wearing this top under sweaters and shells as the weather is moving from winter to spring i think it transitions the comfort of plaid into warmer weather perfectly it dips a little low on me in the front bc so its probably not for more professional settings i like to wear it with a lacy bratype top peeking out underneath
14896,3.0,the fabric is very thin i have seen this comment on several sundry reviews but its hard to imagine how thin the fabric is until you see it in person i could put a cami under it but it was also rather short on me i dont usually have trouble with shirts running short and can even sometimes wear petite sizes since i am only
14897,5.0,this sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater it runs tts however if you like the short length then id size down im d and the xs was perfect the sweater didnt feel too scratchy but its not a soft sweater very feminine
14898,4.0,i purchased this top in the taupe color and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online it runs about a half size too large and sits slightly off the shoulders fun casual top for the fall
14899,5.0,must read
14900,5.0,awasome book it changed my life
14901,1.0,just days out from the day warranty echo dot bricks we followed all fixes noted by amazon and the internet but to no avail alexa just turns off and cannot connect piece of junk
14902,4.0,i loved the color and the style of the sleeves it was a bit too short on me and i thought it made me look boxy so i didnt end up keeping it
14903,2.0,picture clarity sounds clarity are not there
14904,1.0,do not buy it if you buy it for listening to musici can not hear them enough
14905,2.0,after months of usage i am facing problem with right portion of earphone there is no sound output from right part of earphone
14906,3.0,not sure what to think i had great plans for this dress
14907,5.0,this dress is fantastic its super flattering and very versatile for reference i am and lbs and usually a size in retailer dresses the size medium fit perfectly highly recommend this item
14908,5.0,love the echo dot great for music listening to audible books and just plain fun
14909,4.0,great phone
14910,3.0,i have not installed any apps till now most of the time i used the mobile hotspot and youtube the battery doesnt even last for a day not sure how to test if it is really a mah battery my old samsung a battery was much better than this
14911,2.0,i used this for over a month it takes approx six hours to charge fully and does only three recharges of poco f mah battery this is a mah power bank and gives only mah recharge on regular usage initially it gave charges but now within a month of use reduced to three full charges very disapointed
14912,5.0,the phones battery backup lasts one day if you are a regular net surferhas best camera n overall look
14913,4.0,the product is good but i am disappointed with amazon as i have ordered blue colour earphone but i received black one so i return them
14914,4.0,i really loved the material and the feel of this item however it does run very large even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings
14915,1.0,ive worn citizens for almost years now i keep going back because i have an athletic figure my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation these did not meet any of those standards the ripped as soon as i put them on the material seemed cheap
14916,2.0,i think its mistake to buy this because i prefer sound with bass but the sound in this product is just normal sound with more treble and less basswant to return it but cant as return window is closed not impressed with the product
14917,3.0,pros pretty nicely made cons the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting and the blouse cuts in under the arms i dont mean that it is tight or digs in but it cuts in you cant tell in the angle of the photo the blouse is short as well and as i am curvy it really stuck out all around at the waist worth trying on if you have a straighter figure
14918,2.0,average mobile

14966,4.0,i must say that in inr i found the best deals on earphones as this earphones from jbl are really good the sound quality is just awesome i refer this product to one of my friend after listening songs from my jbl earphones he immediately ordered it for him the product is really amazing but giving one star less because it has no l shaped connector which may result into easy breaking of wire at connector side as well as the wire may experience wear tear soon if not used properly noise cancellation is also really brilliant but it could be better the earbuds are slippery sometimes wire looks pretty delicate so you should use it with care not recommended to be used while travelling in a public transport but considering the price tag i can suggest this product to everyone

14983,4.0,it is a treat to finally have a phone which is value for money from the house of samsung i have used this phone for days as my primary and want to share the following pros and cons pros excellent set of cameras megapixel mode is great but the normal mp mode is great too the wide angle lens is the widest available in the market at this price point battery life is exemplary with moderate usage a full charge lasts close to days processor speed is excellent but not the best in class though yet in day to day usage one wouldnt find any problems type c port and a watt fast charger provided in the box is a huge plus has a triple slot solution allowing for a dedicated micro sd slot with sim slots the display is to die for gorgeous that is the only word for it samsung super amoled fhd cons built quality is a downside having a poly carbonate back and no gorilla glass protection it has a version of dragon tail glass though please use a case for the cameras the wide angle camera can record videos but samsungs new implementation super steady mode doesnt work on the wide angle camera also with the super steady mode on the video quality drops while recording even through the main rear camera it will be excellent if samsung can fix this via an ota upgrade this point is entirely personal i did not like the color gradation in this one the vertical one rather would have preferred a mono color back
